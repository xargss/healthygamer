---------01:57----------
it's through something called CBT


---------01:59----------
cognitive behavioral therapy if anyone's


---------02:02----------
heard of it and it's like changing


---------02:04----------
thoughts and that automatic negative


---------02:06----------
force and I feel like that's really


---------02:07----------
helped as well as psychiatry as well

struggle with that I could go by my


---------02:36----------
gamertag wrathy - I don't really care


---------02:39----------
but yeah so I guess just a little bit


---------02:45----------
about myself I guess what I'm doing


---------02:46----------
right now I mean I'm not doing not


---------02:48----------
technically working and you know kovin


---------02:50----------
and all that but I've been trying to use


---------02:55----------
the time off of work to work on like


---------03:01----------
work on any everything I care about


---------03:02----------
primarily programming cool I used to


---------03:07----------
work in the software industry and then I


---------03:12----------
got fired for being a lazy piece of [ __ ]


---------03:15----------
and so I'm trying to not be lazy so I


---------03:24----------
figure if I can like work on a project


---------03:26----------
by myself and like accomplish something


---------03:28----------
I would be pretty confident that I could


---------03:31----------
like work any job and at least get my


---------03:35----------
work done and that kind of thing sure


---------03:37----------
that's where I'm at right now hmm okay


---------03:41----------
thanks I'll end up sharing knocking yeah


---------03:44----------
oh also I just mentioned I also come


---------03:47----------
from an African Christian background too


---------03:49----------
so I feel you man Eli you want to go yes


---------03:56----------
sir


---------03:58----------
I also come from happy Christian and


---------04:01----------
it's a very common thing to have the


---------04:03----------
same mental health thing I'm very lucky


---------04:05----------
that my mom's nurse so mental health has


---------04:07----------
always been a thing that was paid


---------04:08----------
attention to my family and she attempted


---------04:11----------
to get me diagnosed when I was very


---------04:12----------
young my older brother also doubled


---------04:15----------
depression and bipolar disorder and


---------04:16----------
using that nature so I was diagnosed


---------04:18----------
with depression anxiety I think it was


---------04:20----------
about 7 to 12 years old probably more I


---------04:22----------
think about 7 years old


---------04:24----------
and I've dealt with a lot of so in


---------04:27----------
Nigeria I'm Nigerian and Nigerian


---------04:29----------
culture


---------04:29----------
abuse is a very common thing is okay to


---------04:32----------
beat your children and without much care


---------04:33----------
for the pain in which they will go


---------04:36----------
through and the long-term effects with


---------04:38----------
that even now I'm only like actually


---------04:39----------
recognizing the long-term effects with


---------04:41----------
that much like relating to the


---------04:43----------
experience feeling like a lazy piece of


---------04:45----------
[ __ ]


---------04:48----------
but it was the kind of struggle in which


---------04:51----------
I had where I wasn't really able to


---------04:53----------
convey that I wasn't valuing the work


---------04:58----------
that I was doing because academia I like


---------05:00----------
learning things I got to show you all


---------05:01----------
the books I read my free time but


---------05:03----------
because of the fact that when you don't


---------05:05----------
do well in school my like in my


---------05:07----------
household you get beaten like and I


---------05:09----------
would make mistakes a lot and I didn't


---------05:11----------
saamiya cuz my brain like runs at ten


---------05:13----------
miles an hour so it's already hard for


---------05:14----------
me to sleep consistently so that it was


---------05:16----------
really hard to adapt to that when I was


---------05:17----------
a kid


---------05:18----------
so I'd sleep the next class and my


---------05:20----------
teachers called me lazy I got in trouble


---------05:22----------
a lot like me scratching myself and


---------05:25----------
stuff like that got me in trouble once


---------05:26----------
I'm sorry every time I got removed for


---------05:27----------
anything I had to get read slip and I


---------05:29----------
bring the rest at home


---------05:30----------
then it would lead to me getting beaten


---------05:33----------
so I'll be in class crying and things


---------05:35----------
over a red slip my teacher thinks I'm


---------05:36----------
this a child crying over beginning in


---------05:39----------
trouble when in reality because I'm game


---------05:41----------
like being at home and that's something


---------05:44----------
I still have any we unpacked yet but I


---------05:45----------
being Nigerian and recognizing these


---------05:48----------
long-term effects that because I think


---------05:50----------
my mom depression my anxiety stems from


---------05:53----------
a situational thing I wasn't maybe a


---------05:55----------
natural like inclination because I if I


---------05:58----------
had been in a better situation maybe I


---------06:01----------
wouldn't be dealing with the things in


---------06:02----------
which I do deal with but I think that


---------06:04----------
much of what my experiences as black


---------06:06----------
person has been feeling that life is


---------06:09----------
really worth living simply because the


---------06:11----------
colour might


---------06:11----------
again and things I've had to experience


---------06:13----------
and I went to abdominal white high


---------06:15----------
school I wasn't born here I was born in


---------06:16----------
Nigeria and I came when I was about two


---------06:18----------
years old and my mom is someone because


---------06:21----------
of being Nigerian I think you may have


---------06:22----------
Freitas already I don't know if you guys


---------06:24----------
know the Nigerian people but it's just


---------06:26----------
desire to be white designed for


---------06:28----------
whiteness not suit you look white


---------06:30----------
because I still want you to retain your


---------06:31----------
about or Nigerian culture but they want


---------06:34----------
they could like the conception of


---------06:35----------
whiteness is the ideology to follow into


---------06:38----------
and my mom was always happy with my


---------06:39----------
America like if I love the idea of me


---------06:41----------
dating a white girl or being more led to


---------06:44----------
like Akademi or being more into going to


---------06:47----------
like she wants she sees me in the white


---------06:48----------
house he's always told me things like


---------06:49----------
this and it it helped me at times to see


---------06:54----------
that she believed in me but it also felt


---------06:56----------
toxic in the sense that like if I didn't


---------06:58----------
do well I get B and when I did do well


---------07:00----------
to tell me she's proud of me but it's


---------07:01----------
stopping like the the rewards didn't


---------07:05----------
feel like they weighed into the like


---------07:07----------
negatives negatives always from way more


---------07:09----------
than the rewards and that thing I feel


---------07:11----------
like now I've realized me sometimes very


---------07:13----------
depressed over the past like four months


---------07:15----------
ago getting another fax four months


---------07:16----------
three months of corny virus when


---------07:18----------
everything was happening exactly I'm a


---------07:19----------
natural empath


---------07:20----------
I have a bad habit of taking like the


---------07:22----------
pain of others into myself but I


---------07:24----------
realized and around that time and I also


---------07:25----------
wasn't even be able to focus on school I


---------07:27----------
just got so tired of being in school and


---------07:29----------
cuz I must I was a something or going to


---------07:31----------
be a junior about a sophomore in college


---------07:33----------
20 years old but um I realized that the


---------07:36----------
abuse which I face makes it really hard


---------07:38----------
for me to be able to stick to things


---------07:42----------
because I get boarded them very quickly


---------07:44----------
I'm not sure if that's just natural


---------07:46----------
inclination but I'm trying to consider


---------07:48----------
the possibility the possibility now that


---------07:50----------
because of what I had to experience


---------07:51----------
growing up it became very hard for me to


---------07:54----------
express myself fully and also be able to


---------07:58----------
feel like school or any kind of project


---------08:03----------
that was created was worthwhile guys


---------08:04----------
write a lot of poetry and draw a lot


---------08:06----------
when I was growing up as a kid and I


---------08:07----------
helped me feel better when I was very


---------08:08----------
depressed but situations changed and I


---------08:10----------
felt I'll being able to do that but to


---------08:13----------
keep things simple bleep like as simple


---------08:15----------
as I could be being black never really


---------08:18----------
felt like I like a worthwhile thing


---------08:20----------
especially when I learned about police


---------08:21----------
brutality and things like that growing


---------08:23----------
up and learning about social justice and


---------08:24----------
learning about it


---------08:25----------
the world and how difficult it can be


---------08:27----------
simply just because of the color your


---------08:29----------
scans cool man thanks for that intro Eli


---------08:33----------
who wants to go next


---------08:37----------
Oh meet it


---------08:42----------

perfect yeah why don't you go man


---------09:03----------

---------09:05----------
having me on the stream first and


---------09:06----------
foremost it's an absolute pleasure and


---------09:08----------
an honor to talk to you my name is mo I


---------09:10----------
go by a GBH short for a great big hug


---------09:12----------
I'm 26 I'm from Ontario Canada born and


---------09:17----------
raised here family's from North Africa


---------09:19----------
Libya and I have type two bipolar as


---------09:23----------
well it's tough yeah I struggle with my


---------09:25----------
identity all the time growing up I've


---------09:27----------
been told I'm not black enough I've been


---------09:29----------
told I'm too white I've been told I'm


---------09:31----------
not Arabic enough all that type of stuff


---------09:33----------
and it's difficult dealing with this


---------09:35----------
stigma behind mental health especially


---------09:38----------
your own community you get told


---------09:40----------
everything just pray more change your


---------09:42----------
diet you know don't believe in the


---------09:44----------
voodoo stuff all that type of [ __ ] but


---------09:46----------
it's it's it's I think my biggest


---------09:49----------
struggle personally just the stigmas


---------09:50----------
behind mental health and come to terms


---------09:52----------
with it especially within my own


---------09:54----------
community


---------09:56----------
cool thanks so do you prefer a GBH or mo

---------10:51----------

---------10:53----------
whatever he said there just I don't know


---------10:59----------
what's wrong


---------11:00----------
okay so um thank you guys very much for


---------11:04----------
you know so you guys say you're all


---------11:07----------
grateful to be here I'm grateful to have


---------11:09----------
you guys I've I mean I think the people


---------11:10----------
is absolutely mutual


---------11:12----------
so let me just offer a couple of


---------11:15----------
thoughts and then maybe get us started


---------11:16----------
so the first thought that I want to say


---------11:18----------
is that you know we're here to talk


---------11:19----------
about you know the intersection of


---------11:23----------
basically like race and mental health


---------11:25----------
and the first thing that I want to point


---------11:27----------
out is that I I think it's you know it's


---------11:30----------
interesting that you guys have some


---------11:31----------
things that you kind of share in terms


---------11:32----------
of your perspective around or your


---------11:34----------
experience of mental health and and what


---------11:36----------
you sort of gained from your culture the


---------11:38----------
first thing that I want to say though is


---------11:39----------
that I don't I feel like most of what


---------11:42----------
we're gonna talk about is not gonna be


---------11:44----------
restricted to black people like I you


---------11:48----------
know I I know that when I went to India


---------11:50----------
for the first time like there was a guy


---------11:52----------
who had schizophrenia but I studied in


---------11:55----------
an ashram or a monastery and basically


---------11:56----------
like people thought he was possessed by


---------11:58----------
a demon and you know and that's long


---------12:02----------
that's like the way that they interpret


---------12:04----------
that so I think that like you know there


---------12:05----------
are a lot of different cultures that


---------12:07----------
have stigma against mental health I


---------12:09----------
think I'm hearing a lot of struggles


---------12:12----------
around identity which I don't think is


---------12:14----------
specific to a particular race or even


---------12:16----------
even race in general and at the same


---------12:19----------
time you know there are certainly common


---------12:20----------
themes about like religion and


---------12:22----------
conceptions of mental health and the way


---------12:24----------
that you guys were taught the way that


---------12:26----------
people around you conceptualize like


---------12:28----------
what were the challenges that you faced


---------12:30----------
and what kind of labels and treatment


---------12:32----------
you got because of your struggles and so


---------12:36----------
I just you know I think that there's


---------12:38----------
like sort of a tension there between


---------12:40----------
what applies to everyone and at the end


---------12:42----------
of the day I think that you know


---------12:45----------
different people of different than


---------12:46----------
ethnicities have fundamentally different


---------12:48----------
experiences in life and people of


---------12:50----------
different genders have different


---------12:51----------
experiences of life but I think what's


---------12:54----------
really cool about us and in our


---------12:57----------
community is that what brings us


---------12:59----------
together is far greater than what you


---------13:01----------
know separates us so I I just kind of


---------13:05----------
wanted to toss that out and you guys can


---------13:07----------
jump in kind of in any time does anybody


---------13:09----------
like does anybody want to comment or


---------13:11----------
reflect on that or I've got it


---------13:14----------
I agree completely I think you're


---------13:16----------
absolutely right I think the


---------13:17----------
intersectionality is not only within the


---------13:19----------
black community but in so many cultures


---------13:20----------
and communities across the globe even


---------13:22----------
when it comes to things like religion


---------13:24----------
that affects a lot of communities


---------13:25----------
- so I absolutely agree with you as well


---------13:27----------
yeah cool William I'd like my closest


---------13:31----------
friends are


---------13:32----------
can you move forward he like Oh many of


---------13:35----------
my friends are of different races for


---------13:37----------
the very fact that we all relate to the


---------13:39----------
same childhood experiences that


---------13:43----------
regardless of where we come from were


---------13:44----------
like overarching cultural there doesn't


---------13:47----------
have been cool yeah so so there are


---------13:51----------
three basic themes that I kind of heard


---------13:54----------
maybe a couple people like tying


---------13:55----------
together one is a sense of like identity


---------13:58----------
like I thought it was interesting how


---------13:59----------
you know Eli was I wonder Eli if you


---------14:04----------
were basically rewarded for being things


---------14:06----------
that people around you thought was quote


---------14:08----------
unquote more white and yes you know like


---------14:13----------
it's kind of interesting right so like


---------14:14----------
that that that you weren't rewarded for


---------14:16----------
being you you were rewarded for being


---------14:18----------
what they wanted you to be not having


---------14:22----------
the law in school as well so no matter


---------14:23----------
where I went it was the same kind of


---------14:24----------
thing and that's where code-switching


---------14:25----------
was always a thing I had to comprehend


---------14:27----------
since I was a child so when you're


---------14:30----------
precocious I think many other guys in


---------14:32----------
here can understand this or you're a


---------14:34----------
precocious person of color and there's I


---------14:36----------
think here in the Boston is but I'm in


---------14:38----------
Boston here in Boston especially it's


---------14:41----------
the kind of thing where you get


---------14:42----------
compliments on while your English is so


---------14:44----------
good or wow you're really smart for that


---------14:46----------
I thought were you like I said from


---------14:48----------
Nigeria I have these white kids from


---------14:50----------
Southie


---------14:51----------
South Boston say so yeah don't you guys


---------14:53----------
live in huts don't you guys live in


---------14:54----------
teepees like nah I'm from Legos one of


---------14:58----------
the most developed parts of West Africa


---------14:59----------
and like the conception of what it means


---------15:03----------
to be African or what it means to be


---------15:06----------
Nigerian just a dish it was always right


---------15:08----------
in the forefront my head and because of


---------15:11----------
that I had the constant experience of


---------15:15----------
being seen as a bush boy a kwang-ho bush


---------15:19----------
boy this is the thing in my in my


---------15:21----------
culture bush boys like someone who is um


---------15:23----------
honey like say how do I describe English


---------15:26----------
someone who is not raised properly and


---------15:30----------
they see that is your baseline level so


---------15:32----------
when you perform above that you see that


---------15:35----------
oh wow you're here so intelligent


---------15:39----------
and I thought that it was a really weird


---------15:42----------
thing to experience but I tried to learn


---------15:44----------
to define it but I can never really take


---------15:45----------
pride in it because I'd peers who were


---------15:48----------
not treated the same peers who were


---------15:50----------
black and people of color in general but


---------15:52----------
especially the black guys in my grades


---------15:54----------
they weren't treated the same way simply


---------15:57----------
because the fact that they didn't have


---------16:00----------
that same way with words that has the


---------16:03----------
Charter yeah so I think we can talk


---------16:06----------
about identity another thing that we


---------16:09----------
could talk about is like I'm hearing you


---------16:10----------
guys use the phrase piece of [ __ ] or


---------16:13----------
lazy a fair amount like I'm just lazy


---------16:15----------
and and we could kind of dig into like


---------16:18----------
what that means or where that comes from


---------16:20----------
and the third thing that we could talk


---------16:23----------
about you know it sounds like you guys


---------16:25----------
had a couple of really cultural


---------16:27----------
intersections with mental health in


---------16:29----------
terms of stigma prayer you know it


---------16:33----------
sounded like Raymond was basically like


---------16:34----------
you know told to pray the mental health


---------16:36----------
away and and so you know we could talk a


---------16:40----------
little bit about that what do you guys


---------16:42----------
think or you know if you all have a


---------16:43----------
suggestion for something that you'd like


---------16:45----------
to talk about then you know by all means


---------16:47----------
but those are kind of the three things


---------16:49----------
that seem to kind of unite a few


---------16:51----------
different perspectives here so identity


---------16:54----------
being a lazy piece of [ __ ] and stigma


---------16:56----------
and prayer I guess I would like to talk


---------16:58----------
about one other thing I guess being


---------17:00----------
black in the gaming culture because


---------17:03----------
sometimes I feel like I have to change


---------17:05----------
my voice all after kind of like hide my


---------17:09----------
face because there's kind of a few I


---------17:12----------
don't know saying I guess um people hide


---------17:16----------
behind the animal anonymity of being


---------17:19----------
online and they feel free to say


---------17:21----------
whatever they want and sometimes it kind


---------17:25----------
of hurts like maybe it's like a 13 year


---------17:27----------
old kid


---------17:27----------
on Call of Duty or on whatever food


---------17:31----------
lands free or whatever and play and


---------17:33----------
saying the most racist thing that you if


---------17:35----------
the UM their parents heard they would I


---------17:38----------
don't know so I guess that's something


---------17:40----------
else I would like to talk about just


---------17:41----------
being blind community desire to scream


---------17:48----------
but I've always been in my head about


---------17:50----------
series of things my brain likes to find


---------17:51----------
excuses but once


---------17:52----------
I can't get past is like the use of


---------17:54----------
certain emotes and like especially when


---------17:56----------
you have to understand social justice


---------17:57----------
and you see that there's so much use of


---------18:01----------
racial emote racial emotes to talk about


---------18:05----------
like when they're a stereotype comes


---------18:06----------
over a caricature they use the email in


---------18:09----------
relation to that caricature and why is


---------18:10----------
it that one like stealing is talked


---------18:12----------
about stream they start using a black


---------18:14----------
like the c'mon bro trihard and things


---------18:16----------
like that like and I don't want to be


---------18:18----------
the person to like ruin people's fun


---------18:20----------
I've always try to not be that person


---------18:22----------
but is this something that I personally


---------18:24----------
like this I just find it really


---------18:26----------
difficult to get past a lot of time yes


---------18:30----------
so like what is it like being a black


---------18:33----------
gamer I mean I feel like it almost oh no


---------18:42----------
it definitely ties right back into that


---------18:44----------
identity thing like on the like it's


---------18:49----------
just a common theme like okay when I'm


---------18:51----------
with a bunch of other black people all


---------18:53----------
right I'm the African guys so I'm not


---------18:55----------
really one of them alright if I'm with


---------18:57----------
white people on the black guy I'm not


---------18:59----------
really one of them when when I'm with


---------19:01----------
gamers no I'm you know black gamer not


---------19:04----------
really one of them so you're not really


---------19:06----------
always feels like I'm not really allowed


---------19:08----------
to be part of any group so yeah it just


---------19:11----------
feels like the same thing over and over


---------19:12----------
again it feels a lot like being the butt


---------19:15----------
of the joke sometimes it feels a lot


---------19:16----------
like especially when I play something


---------19:18----------
like League of Legends that's known for


---------19:20----------
having a toxic community sometimes it's


---------19:22----------
tough realizing that you're the c'mon


---------19:24----------
bro you're the trihard seven or you're


---------19:26----------
the the mean that's being made fun of


---------19:27----------
and it sucks that your culture is the


---------19:29----------
butt of the joke and and it's weird


---------19:32----------
seeing that level of toxicity so


---------19:33----------
normalized to I can't tell you how many


---------19:35----------
often times growing up seeing just so


---------19:36----------
much toxic behavior on online gaming and


---------19:39----------
it's always a black community and it's


---------19:41----------
tough it sucks being that part of the


---------19:42----------
joke yeah and look at black people have


---------19:45----------
seems to serve as the punchline in a lot


---------19:47----------
of jokes too and I think that person for


---------19:50----------
me like certain streamers I like I'll


---------19:52----------
find them funny but it's also that


---------19:54----------
racial agitation as a joke has always


---------19:57----------
been like a pretty common thing on this


---------19:58----------
platform like I don't like to call names


---------20:00----------
like I like Greek god X I think he I


---------20:02----------
respect his property maybe his weight


---------20:04----------
loss the things he's done to improve


---------20:06----------
yourself as a


---------20:06----------
but like his liberal use a trial heart


---------20:08----------
throughout all of his screaming career


---------20:10----------
and the way in which he look like he


---------20:12----------
doesn't take seriously when it's being


---------20:13----------
used or even mostly being used it


---------20:16----------
stimulates this idea of trihard seven


---------20:19----------
and I feel like I don't want to take


---------20:22----------
that see I won't see you as a joke and


---------20:23----------
see like oh yeah this joking but so I


---------20:27----------
have a couple questions but first can


---------20:28----------
you guys start by explaining to me what


---------20:30----------
these terms mean I I don't know what


---------20:35----------
kind of like poke jump that's like


---------20:39----------
excitement a common broad be is a


---------20:42----------
picture or 'man of a black person as


---------20:45----------
well as the tripod which is of trihex


---------20:47----------
which FEMA and people use it for


---------20:50----------
whenever something seen as black comes


---------20:53----------
on stream and they would spam that email


---------20:57----------
so so the the emotes are actually like


---------21:01----------
of people with dark skin yes and you're


---------21:04----------
referencing actual black because for a


---------21:06----------
second there because I use the word


---------21:08----------
trihard a lot but yeah but that's the


---------21:11----------
different context than the original


---------21:12----------
cause my priority I talk like you're


---------21:14----------
trying harder the game arts yeah exactly


---------21:17----------
that's the rich that's a proper use of


---------21:18----------
trihard trihex is a streamer on Twitch


---------21:22----------
who's black and here an emo it his email


---------21:24----------
from way back when when teachers are


---------21:25----------
like in the early stages of Twitch got


---------21:27----------
it and he is the one who and I think


---------21:30----------
he's originally a track around it's like


---------21:31----------
a Kona cake alone it was a real person


---------21:33----------
from twitch and that's the only email on


---------21:35----------
Twitch at the time and he uploaded it to


---------21:37----------
test I think was test a test stream


---------21:39----------
latches test nightbot well nonetheless


---------21:41----------
these are like an L is another one of


---------21:43----------
those ones who describes a Muslim person


---------21:45----------
and I think Nam describes an Asian


---------21:48----------
person but I'm not sure which


---------21:50----------
nationality specifically but there's so


---------21:53----------
many different ones they're literally


---------21:54----------
just a person who is of a specific race


---------21:56----------
that that's crazy I didn't realize I


---------22:00----------
mean I guess it's no surprise that


---------22:01----------
they're racist emotes but but I wasn't


---------22:05----------
aware of that so I'm kind of curious um


---------22:07----------
mo you were talking about sort of like


---------22:10----------
you know sort of how can I say like


---------22:15----------
there's almost a certain constancy to


---------22:18----------
what you guys face


---------22:20----------
in terms of like it's like I'm just


---------22:22----------
hearing all of you guys talk about


---------22:24----------
gaming and that there's like just an


---------22:27----------
additional layer of [ __ ] that keeps you


---------22:29----------
from having fun when you gain like what


---------22:32----------
does that make sense like I don't know


---------22:34----------
how else to put it


---------22:34----------
what is that yeah how does that do to


---------22:36----------
you


---------22:38----------
uh it makes me it makes me want to build


---------22:40----------
up barriers and it makes me like develop


---------22:42----------
a thicker skin I find like seeing like


---------22:44----------
for example playing World of Warcraft or


---------22:46----------
League of Legends I see so many people


---------22:47----------
whose usernames are just altered


---------22:49----------
spellings of the n-word or big n-word or


---------22:51----------
something like that like just finding


---------22:53----------
some way to be to use that word in any


---------22:56----------
term it's and it feels as almost if it's


---------22:58----------
as if it's like super force on their


---------22:59----------
part but when I see that you grow like


---------23:01----------
indifferent to it you recognize that


---------23:03----------
that's not you you recognize that that's


---------23:04----------
not true you realize that like you just


---------23:07----------
have to develop these barriers I find to


---------23:08----------
just have such a thicker skin because of


---------23:10----------
it yeah so like you know that actually


---------23:13----------
seems so insidious to me because it's


---------23:16----------
like you have to you have another layer


---------23:19----------
of like cognitive [ __ ] that you're


---------23:21----------
dealing with you mean you're playing a


---------23:22----------
game like I've experienced a fair amount


---------23:25----------
of racism in my life like I grew up in


---------23:27----------
East Texas and I'm brown and you know


---------23:30----------
any color except for white in in sexist


---------23:33----------
you know you deal with racism and at the


---------23:38----------
same time though when I play video games


---------23:40----------
like I never think about my ethnicity


---------23:42----------
unless I'm like doing an Indian accent


---------23:44----------
and being as racially offensive as


---------23:45----------
possible you know and so I'm just like


---------23:50----------
I'm just imagining that when you guys


---------23:52----------
like play games it's sort of like you


---------23:53----------
have to do some kind of like work or


---------23:55----------
it's just hard for you to just like play


---------23:57----------
a game yeah you got to keep up the


---------24:00----------
quotes which even while you're playing


---------24:01----------
the game if you want to play games of


---------24:03----------
random people and then you end up miner


---------24:05----------
queueing with a kid who who this as soon


---------24:09----------
as he hears a black guy's voice these


---------24:11----------
things he needs to start acting some


---------24:13----------
kind of way or start saying the n-word


---------24:14----------
to start doing something extra and the


---------24:17----------
beats the kind of thing it's not just


---------24:18----------
gaming but like even just being out in


---------24:20----------
public in general the first time I


---------24:21----------
really experienced like being seen as a


---------24:23----------
stereotype like fully was one that guy


---------24:25----------
from France this um this exchange doing


---------24:28----------
it I wasn't mad about it I'm about this


---------24:31----------
this is a bigger portrayal about how


---------24:32----------
black people character or black people


---------24:33----------
in the


---------24:34----------
but the first thing he did when he saw


---------24:36----------
me was throw gang signs say and


---------24:39----------
everywhere so say hi and I understood


---------24:42----------
that he was trying to be nice and you


---------24:44----------
that's us but is this a caricature and


---------24:46----------
character something that has always


---------24:48----------
bothered me since I was very young this


---------24:49----------
because you recognize the ways in which


---------24:51----------
black people have been even like similar


---------24:54----------
not as black people any race for that


---------24:56----------
matter days and white has been


---------24:57----------
assimilated in society was through their


---------24:58----------
caricature so if you've played into the


---------25:00----------
caricature you played into those ways in


---------25:02----------
which were already seen that people have


---------25:04----------
the question then you can find success


---------25:05----------
in the conventional society you can


---------25:07----------
assimilate into heteronormative parts of


---------25:09----------
society yeah that's deep man I'm also


---------25:15----------
kind of just noticing that you guys have


---------25:17----------
a I'm sourcing another identity piece


---------25:20----------
here to that like you know it seems like


---------25:22----------
you guys are just not treated for who


---------25:25----------
you are it's like 80% of who you are or


---------25:28----------
maybe even less than 20% of like what


---------25:30----------
people think you are yeah yeah for sure


---------25:37----------
what's that like time in a row it's very


---------25:42----------
tiring and that's what places my


---------25:44----------
depression as well because and it just


---------25:46----------
makes being alive and having to be an


---------25:47----------
actor in the world very tiring it feels


---------25:52----------
like I'm constantly putting on a face


---------25:53----------
and it feels like I shouldn't have to do


---------25:56----------
that either


---------25:57----------
that won't keep all my have is like


---------26:00----------
watching black kids have to get used to


---------26:01----------
hearing the n-word why should they have


---------26:03----------
to even get like Mama's having to get


---------26:05----------
used to ignorant now this black kids for


---------26:07----------
any race for that matter why'd you have


---------26:08----------
to get used to ignorant it's like of


---------26:11----------
course you should go thick-skinned a


---------26:12----------
virgin who learn to not be too sensitive


---------26:14----------
but why is that some of that person


---------26:16----------
should have to get used to why should


---------26:18----------
they have to get used to hate yeah


---------26:22----------
what's it like to have to get used to


---------26:24----------
hate


---------26:27----------
and I don't know if you want to jump in


---------26:30----------
because I can't face I was kind of


---------26:32----------
thinking a lot because like in high


---------26:35----------
school a lot of times like the way I


---------26:37----------
would just like to kind of like


---------26:49----------
customize to fit in basically I was just


---------26:51----------
always making like jokes about myself or


---------26:54----------
whatever


---------26:54----------
Demaryius well that was until my teacher


---------26:59----------
like pointed them out you like join I


---------27:01----------
like you okay do you like hey no it's


---------27:04----------
like you think it's funny so play along


---------27:07----------
and now it's just horrible Julian your


---------27:10----------
voice is still coming through kind of


---------27:12----------
robotic oh sorry


---------27:14----------
there we go would you go okay I move my


---------27:17----------
mic to play a game that's like oh yeah I


---------27:23----------
just moved it a bit okay great yeah now


---------27:26----------
it's - what what did you hear


---------27:28----------
not much okay I'll try I'll try that


---------27:31----------
again I'm in high school I'm like I had


---------27:36----------
so and they were like it's like Florida


---------27:39----------
it's kind of like a deep south oh


---------27:40----------
they're pretty racist and like just fit


---------27:43----------
in I would just make myself and


---------27:45----------
everything and they got some of my we


---------27:47----------
were like some of my teachers were like


---------27:48----------
concerned that like I actually hated my


---------27:50----------
face or something I was like no I don't


---------27:52----------
really care it's just like makes them


---------27:54----------
laugh like I'll just be with and that's


---------27:57----------
not so it sounds like you're living an


---------27:59----------
actor - yeah but it's it's really like


---------28:03----------
tired like I think you said to be like


---------28:07----------
using like a willpower to keep going and


---------28:09----------
I'm like at some point start to run out


---------28:14----------
hearing other people kind of say that -


---------28:16----------
I'm kind of curious


---------28:17----------
it was aachen is that right am i


---------28:22----------
pronouncing that right uh not exactly


---------28:25----------
but I take aachen as well knocking


---------28:30----------
knocking okay


---------28:32----------
yeah Hawking and and Raymond do y'all


---------28:35----------
want to jump in like what's any thoughts


---------28:37----------
about what we're talking about


---------28:40----------
yeah I mean now that I mean now that


---------28:45----------
people are talking about it I'm kind of


---------28:47----------
like reflecting on like so for high


---------28:49----------
school I went to a predominantly white


---------28:51----------
school and like at the time I was a


---------28:56----------
loner and I was like okay that's just my


---------28:58----------
thing


---------28:59----------
which is true to an extent but I do


---------29:02----------
think that being one of like three black


---------29:05----------
guys in high school made me much more


---------29:08----------
extremely of a loner


---------29:09----------
and I think it was yeah and I think it


---------29:13----------
was there was a lot of like these guys


---------29:15----------
it felt like these guys had never seen a


---------29:17----------
black person before so they just had all


---------29:22----------
these really dumb like these really dumb


---------29:26----------
black jokes like not intended to be


---------29:28----------
offensive but they're like wow I've


---------29:29----------
never gotten to use this before kind of


---------29:31----------
thing and it was just like it's just


---------29:34----------
like a constant like facepalm kind of


---------29:36----------
situation and but you know that like I


---------29:39----------
know they don't have a bad intention to


---------29:40----------
it so it's just like I guess I just got


---------29:42----------
to sit here and listen to this nonsense


---------29:45----------
every single day and I think that it


---------29:51----------
does highlight the difference between us


---------29:53----------
and made it easier for me to feel


---------29:57----------
isolated and I already would have


---------29:59----------
probably like I already would have


---------30:02----------
isolated myself a little but that just


---------30:03----------
made it extreme where I was like talking


---------30:05----------
to almost no one oh yeah I'm for me I


---------30:13----------
guess for in terms of being an actor I


---------30:16----------
come from South London and I'm Nigerian


---------30:19----------
as well so we have a lot of slang that


---------30:22----------
we use but working in like a


---------30:24----------
professional environment I felt like I


---------30:26----------
had to act a certain way to kind of


---------30:30----------
survive if that makes sense


---------30:31----------
so um I guess trying to be understand


---------30:35----------
what that means


---------30:36----------
so if like being myself or I'm using


---------30:41----------
like slang terms that I may use like it


---------30:46----------
may be a joke but I fam and prov if you


---------30:50----------
guys might like


---------30:53----------
I guess like in the professional setting


---------30:55----------
where let's say like it is a boardroom


---------30:57----------
and everyone speaking a posture and in


---------31:00----------
posh English sort of way I felt like I


---------31:03----------
had to imitate that too


---------31:06----------
- if that makes us have to imitate that


---------31:10----------
- I guess to survive in the workplace


---------31:14----------
and I felt like sometimes I had to also


---------31:16----------
be overly friendly as well so like when


---------31:20----------
I go into elevators and stuff like that


---------31:22----------
I'm smiling everyone that knows me in my


---------31:25----------
personal life um I try to be kind or


---------31:29----------
wherever possible but um whenever I


---------31:32----------
can't but um when I go into an elevator


---------31:35----------
the first ring first instincts of like a


---------31:38----------
woman would be like to clench onto her


---------31:41----------
handbag or say oh he scared me when I'm


---------31:44----------
just walking like a normally walk is I'm


---------31:47----------
not trying to be scary I'm just me um


---------31:50----------
and I guess yeah just having to be


---------31:54----------
overly friendly so I don't scare anyone


---------31:56----------
um I feel like yeah that's how I feel in


---------32:00----------
terms of acting in the workplace a lot


---------32:06----------
yeah we have to be constantly aware of


---------32:10----------
the fact that people see you in some


---------32:11----------
kind of way and that's why I don't like


---------32:12----------
being around cops I've never liked being


---------32:14----------
around even when doing nothing wrong


---------32:15----------
I've been put like stops I'm lucky I'm


---------32:17----------
lucky telling you stop twice in my life


---------32:19----------
but each of the contexts in which I


---------32:21----------
would stop a little something stupid and


---------32:22----------
just because the fact I'm walking around


---------32:24----------
while being black in the neighborhood


---------32:26----------
that's apparently supposed to be Dom new


---------32:27----------
UI and I've growing up in like here in


---------32:30----------
Boston this is Dorchester and there's


---------32:32----------
South Boston and I went I grew up going


---------32:34----------
to a school from fifth to twelfth grade


---------32:37----------
that was predominantly white because it


---------32:39----------
bordered between those two neighborhoods


---------32:41----------
and because of that experienced I found


---------32:43----------
that you always have to be walking on


---------32:46----------
because even when I was we had like


---------32:47----------
debates on things black lives matter


---------32:49----------
back in 2014 during the Ferguson riots


---------32:51----------
there were always the perspective of


---------32:54----------
these kids and I've never got angry at


---------32:56----------
them so much is the fact that I was just


---------32:58----------
sad that their own ignorance because


---------33:00----------
they were unwilling to learn or only to


---------33:02----------
see a world outside themselves which


---------33:03----------
song says black lives matter it doesn't


---------33:05----------
mean that other people's lives don't


---------33:07----------
matter


---------33:07----------
that is making a statement and you can


---------33:09----------
also say Asian lives matter we can say


---------33:11----------
Hispanic lives matter you could say


---------33:13----------
Indian lives matter you can say so many


---------33:15----------
people's lives matter but it doesn't


---------33:17----------
devalue the lives of other people


---------33:19----------
but other people still have the desire


---------33:20----------
to say that no all lives matter but why


---------33:23----------
should you even have split no before


---------33:24----------
that I think those two things are not


---------33:27----------
mutually exclusive they can coexist but


---------33:30----------
I had to find that most of my childhood


---------33:32----------
was having to educate people on I don't


---------33:37----------
like the closest phrases you have to


---------33:39----------
educate your oppressor to say the least


---------33:41----------
that's and that's the closest thing I


---------33:43----------
can understand to be able to express


---------33:45----------
like much of my life has been trying to


---------33:46----------
educate people on where I'm coming from


---------33:48----------
and not being defined my skin can you


---------33:51----------
guys explain to us what what black lives


---------33:55----------
matter means to you yeah to me black


---------34:01----------
lives matter too I think that's what


---------34:04----------
people sometimes forget is that we're


---------34:05----------
not seeing only black lives matter we're


---------34:07----------
saying black lives matter too and I


---------34:10----------
think that's the biggest distinction


---------34:12----------
when I hear it like growing up in Canada


---------34:14----------
it's I hear more polite forms of racism


---------34:17----------
being told something like all lives


---------34:19----------
matter or being told that there's only


---------34:21----------
one race and that's human you're


---------34:22----------
undermining the true ethnicity that I am


---------34:25----------
you're undermining my experiences and


---------34:27----------
the shared experiences of many cultures


---------34:28----------
and many diasporas and when you when you


---------34:30----------
say something like all lives matter yeah


---------34:32----------
obviously we get that our lives do


---------34:34----------
matter but black lives matter too that's


---------34:37----------
my plan and racists have literally


---------34:39----------
employed Lee what he just said there's


---------34:42----------
only one race in the human race but we


---------34:43----------
have the right to say we want to keep


---------34:45----------
this place white I've literally heard


---------34:46----------
those words verbatim in the interview I


---------34:47----------
wish I could pull it up right now but in


---------34:49----------
the interview that Oprah wrench we did a


---------34:51----------
long time ago I forget which location


---------34:53----------
that was but it was location would that


---------34:55----------
- filled with tons of um hate crimes


---------34:57----------
against black people and where the levy


---------34:59----------
has Brady anywhere in places that black


---------35:00----------
people congregate and it's the


---------35:03----------
experience that clouds matter to me is


---------35:05----------
that no matter how wrong the crime a


---------35:09----------
black person has committed he don't


---------35:10----------
deserve to die on the street like a dog


---------35:11----------
and I've had to select my especially now


---------35:14----------
with the protester but having recently I


---------35:15----------
think I should seek men's out this


---------35:17----------
mental health help mental health help


---------35:19----------
with this because after have


---------35:21----------
to see so many black people die in the


---------35:23----------
street and like you shouldn't having to


---------35:26----------
see people bleed out like usually you're


---------35:28----------
seeing it you're with your own eyes are


---------35:30----------
you seeing like what what human being


---------35:32----------
looks like as they're dying especially a


---------35:35----------
black like this for two cops hitting the


---------35:38----------
person down and they're not holding


---------35:40----------
still for any whatever reason might be


---------35:42----------
they just get shot and killed and then


---------35:45----------
they hang cuff them and I just had to


---------35:47----------
see that at least ten times in the past


---------35:49----------
week alone and it's I feel like the fact


---------35:51----------
I'm so desensitized to it bothers me a


---------35:53----------
lot


---------35:54----------
because I'm the kind of person who's


---------35:56----------
naturally apathetic and I feel other


---------35:57----------
people's fit pain very strongly and I'm


---------36:00----------
at the point where I can look at that


---------36:01----------
and I just I can I keep I can keep I


---------36:04----------
just character keeps growing and that's


---------36:06----------
why I haven't been on social media that


---------36:07----------
much recently because as much as I want


---------36:09----------
to be retweeting what's happening and


---------36:10----------
trying to spread awareness about what's


---------36:11----------
happening the revolution that's going on


---------36:13----------
it is difficult in the sense that you


---------36:16----------
succeed how much would like Keibler why


---------36:18----------
did why did why does it take people to


---------36:21----------
die for justice to come why do we wait


---------36:24----------
has to wait until after Brianna Taylor


---------36:25----------
is dead or George Florida is dead or


---------36:27----------
Armen Aubree's dead or Tamir rice is


---------36:29----------
dead like so many young black people and


---------36:31----------
black trans people - or black people of


---------36:33----------
any kind of identity why do they have to


---------36:35----------
die first for justice a sense of like it


---------36:41----------
shouldn't be this way that's what I'm


---------36:45----------
hearing like in it it's not it's not


---------36:47----------
just people dying although you know


---------36:49----------
definitely applies there but like even


---------36:51----------
just you know just the way you guys grew


---------36:53----------
up and like when I'm thinking about


---------36:55----------
Raymond walking into a boardroom like


---------36:57----------
you just can't speak like he I and I'm


---------36:59----------
inferring that you sort of speak


---------37:01----------
differently and I use you guys just it's


---------37:05----------
I don't know how to it's like you guys


---------37:06----------
are playing life like on hardmode it's


---------37:10----------
like what's the normal game and then


---------37:12----------
there's the game with like all this


---------37:14----------
other like layer of [ __ ] piled on top


---------37:17----------
maybe Gioconda on the games that they


---------37:20----------
made um the black if you made your


---------37:23----------
character black yeah


---------37:29----------
20 percent greater chance to be stopped


---------37:33----------
by the police like minus five to speech


---------37:35----------
or like people's reactions to you or


---------37:38----------
like you know get a job you get rejected


---------37:40----------
immediately yep the big day it's really


---------37:43----------
like what I think about playing a game


---------37:44----------
I've been playing like I don't know if


---------37:45----------
y'all played total war but I've been


---------37:48----------
I've been playing a lot of total war and


---------37:50----------
it's like literally like the game just


---------37:51----------
you know on hardmode it's like you just


---------37:52----------
get like penalties to everything it's


---------37:57----------
like number of people you can connect


---------38:00----------
with easily at school goes down from


---------38:02----------
like 52 it's just like I mean I'm


---------38:07----------
laughing about it but I mean it sounds


---------38:09----------
[ __ ] awful like it just it just just


---------38:13----------
harder like it sounds a little bit more


---------38:15----------
tiring a little bit more exhausting it


---------38:17----------
sounds like you guys just have to spend


---------38:19----------
a little bit more energy or maybe even a


---------38:21----------
lot more energy to kind of do things I'm


---------38:25----------
really curious though Raymond it's just


---------38:27----------
so fascinating though what do you think


---------38:28----------
would happen if you didn't change the


---------38:30----------
way that you spoke um


---------38:32----------
I've got no idea I have to try it to


---------38:36----------
find all yeah yeah I mean although I


---------38:46----------
think would happen I guess it would be a


---------38:48----------
lot harder for people to understand me


---------38:49----------
because I work in a global company and


---------38:53----------
there's people from all around the world


---------38:55----------
so when we do like a zoom call or a


---------38:59----------
WebEx cool if I was to speak in a South


---------39:03----------
London accent or pidgin English which is


---------39:07----------
dialect in the Yerba culture which is in


---------39:10----------
Nigeria it will I would think that it's


---------39:13----------
it would be a lot harder for people to


---------39:16----------
understand what I'm saying because of it


---------39:18----------
being a another dialect or Lang it's the


---------39:23----------
same language but yeah it was a bit


---------39:26----------
harder to understand I guess maybe I can


---------39:28----------
try try and discuss them trying this and


---------39:31----------
see if you guys on sunny you want to go


---------39:39----------
for it I was just kind of curious like


---------39:40----------
you know what what happens when you guys


---------39:42----------
because I


---------39:43----------
this kind of comes back to identity that


---------39:44----------
you know so I'm getting the sense that


---------39:46----------
it's hard for y'all to be like fully


---------39:48----------
authentic and yeah I'm kind of curious


---------39:52----------
like have you guys so you know I think


---------39:55----------
that a lot of times we learn the


---------39:57----------
behaviors that we do right so like we


---------40:00----------
learn to put up barriers we learn or the


---------40:02----------
reason that we put up areas is because


---------40:04----------
when we don't have barriers we get hurt


---------40:06----------
in some way so I'm kind of curious have


---------40:08----------
you guys had periods of your life or


---------40:11----------
things that you remember where you like


---------40:12----------
really did try to be you and you were


---------40:14----------
like punished for it I mean I guess kind


---------40:21----------
of start like move back home I have like


---------40:29----------
the greatest childhood and he he doesn't


---------40:31----------
allow me to think for myself I think I


---------40:33----------
was talking about I wanted to do again


---------40:36----------
the future just like I was like what


---------40:37----------
cool and he said like if I did that I


---------40:40----------
would be failing him and like oh yeah


---------40:54----------
basically when I came home oh is that


---------41:02----------
better


---------41:02----------
yes yeah yeah okay I'll try it's like


---------41:05----------
this law only wants you to transmit the


---------41:08----------
words is that better hopefully this


---------41:17----------
works um but when I came back home and


---------41:19----------
I'm just around my relationship I tried


---------41:23----------
it like I was thinking about like maybe


---------41:25----------
looking into psychology because I


---------41:27----------
wouldn't want to work on like a prison


---------41:28----------
reform like better committed to the work


---------41:33----------
force afterwards and I told my dad this


---------41:36----------
and he told me he like if I did that I


---------41:41----------
wouldn't fail and all the work you do


---------41:47----------
and I gave him like a second chance like


---------41:50----------
a be like triple down on it I'll say


---------41:56----------
I'm gonna be stuff Julian I'm just gonna


---------42:04----------
ask someone else to just kind of reflect


---------42:06----------
back what they heard just because it


---------42:08----------
didn't come through entirely clearly did


---------42:09----------
somebody want to just share hurt from


---------42:11----------
Julian yes right so Julian's saying that


---------42:14----------
you want side of psychology program well


---------42:16----------
he was talking to his dad he wanted to


---------42:17----------
do something different with psychology I


---------42:19----------
could help with Prison Reforms and


---------42:20----------
people get reactivated Society and he


---------42:23----------
well his father disagreed and said that


---------42:26----------
you shouldn't do that and they talked


---------42:28----------
about it again and if I'll double down


---------42:30----------
on it and I think he said that he has to


---------42:33----------
be material on his own and that's beyond


---------42:35----------
his own to be able to figure to get be


---------42:37----------
and do the things he wants to do yeah I


---------42:42----------
mean I don't I don't want to skip the


---------42:45----------
part where he his dad said if you do


---------42:48----------
that you will waste everything that I've


---------42:50----------
done for you yeah by god that's [ __ ]


---------42:53----------
brutal Jesus does that resonate with you


---------42:57----------
for a particular reason I mean it sounds


---------42:59----------
like um I mean my like my parents are I


---------43:06----------
mean my mom is very is actually very


---------43:09----------
nice but like I think from every other


---------43:14----------
Nigerian American that I've ever met


---------43:16----------
there is just a lot of pressure to like


---------43:18----------
be like the best ever though at this


---------43:25----------
point at this what I mean my mom is like


---------43:27----------
pretty mellow at this point but it's


---------43:29----------
already so deep in my psyche that that's


---------43:31----------
just my own internal voice at this point


---------43:32----------
so I yeah I would like that would be my


---------43:36----------
own mind telling me like yeah if you do


---------43:38----------
this other thing then you're naughty


---------43:41----------
you're wasting all of the efforts of of


---------43:44----------
your parents of of everything that


---------43:47----------
you've done up to this point so it


---------43:50----------
resonates on that level same here bro


---------43:53----------
like that's new to me too and I've had


---------43:55----------
the connotation my mom because college


---------43:57----------
is very difficult thing for me and I


---------43:59----------
tried having the conversation my mom


---------44:00----------
seemed this defer for last semester


---------44:02----------
because I wasn't doing well in school


---------44:04----------
because my rising much messed up my


---------44:05----------
first year and even got so heated to the


---------44:09----------
point


---------44:09----------
where he said if he thinks he knows so


---------44:11----------
much better he can live on his own and I


---------44:13----------
like that she would say that because I


---------44:15----------
it really mess with my mental for a


---------44:18----------
little while and still does in a lot of


---------44:20----------
ways but I also struggled with the fact


---------44:23----------
that she only sees me an extension of


---------44:26----------
herself especially when I got my first


---------44:27----------
tattoo


---------44:28----------
it became the kind of thing where I


---------44:30----------
wasn't able to be who I wanted me for


---------44:34----------
myself there was only about how she saw


---------44:36----------
me who she thought I needed to be in the


---------44:37----------
world and all her fears and trip and


---------44:40----------
she's also a Christian she wants to be a


---------44:41----------
minister so that's that on top of all


---------44:43----------
the other things you know it's but I'm


---------44:45----------
lucky that she is at least as accepting


---------44:47----------
as she is because my brother is


---------44:49----------
transferred female male and he has been


---------44:51----------
able to experience that for himself and


---------44:53----------
be a human being in the world and be a


---------44:54----------
full person in the world because she


---------44:56----------
listens to what I have to say one day


---------44:57----------
and was able to accept that but her


---------44:59----------
where her beliefs aside Elaine be who he


---------45:02----------
is so I do believe there's a hope for my


---------45:04----------
relationship with my mom but just being


---------45:05----------
able to understand how to talk to her


---------45:07----------
and make amends with all the things in


---------45:09----------
which we have dealt with because she had


---------45:10----------
been in a similar situation as Alfonso I


---------45:17----------
was gonna say like Oh super wholesome


---------45:24----------
you said your brother yeah brother I'm


---------45:29----------
out here I guess have you guys found


---------45:36----------
sorry I wanted to say something I just


---------45:40----------
lost its right of it yeah so I you know


---------45:43----------
it sounds like Julian's dad was pretty


---------45:45----------
rough on him it sounds like a keen and


---------45:47----------
Eli's mom mother's have been pretty


---------45:51----------
supportive I'm curious what about it


---------45:53----------
like how what's been he also


---------45:56----------
relationship with your dad or if Moe or


---------45:59----------
Raymond want to jump in like a so it


---------46:01----------
sounds like family dynamics are pretty


---------46:02----------
different yes so my parents emigrated to


---------46:08----------
the UK when off in their late 20s so um


---------46:13----------
they had a lot of expectations when I


---------46:15----------
was younger so I'm guessing this is


---------46:17----------
similar to lot of immigrant cultures


---------46:19----------
where is Eva


---------46:23----------
first class which is an A in the u.s. or


---------46:26----------
bust so this this is I think my second


---------46:29----------
time trying uni University and I'm


---------46:33----------
liking it a lot more now but now that


---------46:35----------
I've said okay I'm just going to do my


---------46:36----------
best is not I have to get a first class


---------46:39----------
I have to get 70% half to get the A+ is


---------46:42----------
it's just me trying my best but um I


---------46:45----------
struggled a lot with perfectionism


---------46:48----------
because um the only time I saw my dad


---------46:51----------
happy was when I came home with the


---------46:54----------
level 5 which is like the yeah with the


---------46:57----------
height which is like a high school in


---------47:00----------
primary school I guess the terms let me


---------47:03----------
let me translate the American middle


---------47:06----------
school miss school that might be okay


---------47:08----------
like the high school in middle school if


---------47:11----------
I got like a seeds like why didn't you


---------47:14----------
get an eighth if I get one got my 4% why


---------47:16----------
didn't you why did you miss that 6%


---------47:18----------
because it was sort of point where um


---------47:21----------
yeah it's never like yes it's never it


---------47:25----------
was never enough unless it was a hundred


---------47:27----------
percent and even if it was a hundred


---------47:28----------
percent it was just a yes yeah let's see


---------47:37----------
you do again yeah exactly


---------47:39----------
so yeah going through therapy it out on


---------47:44----------
tank all of those mental models I had of


---------47:46----------
perfectionism I have to get that a


---------47:48----------
because a lot of back I couldn't control


---------47:50----------
and all I could do was my best and when


---------47:53----------
I got to the the person was marking it


---------47:55----------
maybe if they're having a bad day or


---------47:57----------
they had the argument their girlfriend


---------47:59----------
they might be like okay let me give this


---------48:01----------
person their 65 is over 70 and yeah yeah


---------48:06----------
herpes helped a lot but I feel like he


---------48:09----------
is something does I shared amongst all


---------48:12----------
of us here


---------48:13----------
well he's Louis I just wanted to care


---------48:16----------
apply my mom has been supportive but for


---------48:20----------
it's only within things that fit her


---------48:21----------
frame her paradigm and slowly she's


---------48:24----------
coming out of that but like I relate to


---------48:27----------
what he just said so strongly and it's


---------48:28----------
still a problem that I deal with right


---------48:30----------
now my mom because college is just I


---------48:32----------
want to help people my life but I just


---------48:34----------
don't like a key


---------48:35----------
any more and just in methods this past


---------48:38----------
three months was really hard for me


---------48:39----------
simply because I could not even get


---------48:41----------
myself the type of word in an essay and


---------48:43----------
I was struggling with this doing online


---------48:45----------
classes simply I it just felt like all


---------48:49----------
the trauma of academia was rising up in


---------48:51----------
me in that moment and I wasn't able to


---------48:54----------
perform anymore because there just


---------48:57----------
didn't feel worth de anymore and I get


---------48:59----------
to that point so many times with school


---------49:05----------
alright so let me actually ask you guys


---------49:07----------
first so like what do you guys think


---------49:10----------
about our discussion so far is the only


---------49:12----------
thing they don't talk more about or


---------49:14----------
anything that I think is just like to


---------49:18----------
kind of check in with you guys what do


---------49:19----------
you guys how do you think we're doing I


---------49:21----------
think I think a night Opik we should


---------49:24----------
touch on as well as the idea of like


---------49:25----------
normality and the idea within cultures


---------49:27----------
of like what is normal and I are


---------49:29----------
supposed to be a true African I supposed


---------49:31----------
to be a healthy person I also struggle a


---------49:33----------
lot with like toxic masculinity as well


---------49:35----------
I find it's really prevalent in a lot of


---------49:37----------
our culture especially amongst youth and


---------49:40----------
especially amongst the older heads as


---------49:41----------
well it's you know real men don't cry


---------49:43----------
and real men don't have these feelings


---------49:45----------
and real men aren't this and real men


---------49:47----------
aren't sick and all that type of stuff


---------49:48----------
and it's those stigmas that really


---------49:50----------
affected me personally I remember I'm


---------49:52----------
thankful in the sense that my family has


---------49:54----------
been pretty supportive in a lot of


---------49:55----------
aspects especially with my mental health


---------49:58----------
but it took them a while to work up to


---------50:00----------
that it took them a while to get used to


---------50:02----------
it I struggle a lot with my peers I find


---------50:05----------
that it's difficult to be myself around


---------50:06----------
certain groups of friends and especially


---------50:08----------
growing up in high school I had that


---------50:09----------
issue a lot naturally I'm a very


---------50:11----------
energetic and flamboyant person but I


---------50:13----------
have to tone that down and I have to you


---------50:15----------
know not be gay or not be this way or


---------50:17----------
not be that or in stuff like that not be


---------50:18----------
too black not be too Arabic and not be


---------50:20----------
too whatever and I think it's a similar


---------50:22----------
what Raymond deals with in the board


---------50:24----------
room like it's you have to police your


---------50:26----------
own language and you have to police


---------50:27----------
yourself and it sucks and it's straining


---------50:28----------
to have to constantly do that so let's


---------50:31----------
talk about that mo so in the chat


---------50:36----------
someone in the chat said define sorry


---------50:39----------
interrupt the Sun sets that define toxic


---------50:41----------
masculinity talk so toxic masculinity


---------50:44----------
visit my personal experience of my


---------50:46----------
understanding the definition was it's


---------50:48----------
the kind of mescaline that forces you to


---------50:50----------
be a specific kind of way isn't matter


---------50:53----------
what way that is but usually it's


---------50:54----------
aggressive hyper-masculinity


---------50:56----------
that is the toxic kind of thing and


---------50:59----------
things that devalue you if you don't fit


---------51:01----------
the common frame what a man is and my


---------51:04----------
mom is also like women also perpetuate


---------51:06----------
and my culture at least perpetuate that


---------51:08----------
same thing I'm supposed to be the man of


---------51:09----------
the house originally being the only boy


---------51:11----------
in the family being the man of the house


---------51:13----------
is making her believing that I have to


---------51:15----------
be responsible for things or acting a


---------51:17----------
certain kind of way to look a certain


---------51:18----------
kind of way or perform in certain ways


---------51:22----------
simply because I'm a guy anybody else


---------51:26----------
want to add to he lies definition thanks


---------51:28----------
for that man kind of it's how do I


---------51:33----------
explain those it's kind of what I like


---------51:34----------
the world's kind of just jumping their


---------51:36----------
own like you go but you should be on you


---------51:38----------
and usually it's just like like why


---------51:40----------
aren't you doing this and like why are


---------51:42----------
you doing this sort of this and you


---------51:44----------
should be like everyone else to here


---------51:45----------
like you should yeah that's level rather


---------51:47----------
than work that right now really yeah


---------51:53----------
yeah I I hate that there are strong


---------51:55----------
feelings of shame when it comes to toxin


---------51:56----------
masculinity you feel embarrassed that


---------51:58----------
because you're not a certain way or you


---------51:59----------
feel like like it's always people


---------52:01----------
shaming you into acting a certain way


---------52:03----------
and that's never a good motivator I


---------52:04----------
don't think for like how would it be and


---------52:06----------
neither is that correct in the first


---------52:08----------
place Oh what have you been shamed into


---------52:10----------
doing I guess having like a traditional


---------52:14----------
job having a traditional career with my


---------52:16----------
family


---------52:17----------
acting a certain way being traditionally


---------52:19----------
Arabic being traditionally Muslim being


---------52:21----------
traditionally African being the


---------52:23----------
breadwinner of the family and it's it's


---------52:25----------
it's tough because I get told like when


---------52:27----------
I first was found that life was going


---------52:29----------
through my manic phases and I had my


---------52:31----------
dealings with bipolar disorder it was


---------52:33----------
tough because I was told to just pray it


---------52:35----------
away I was told to you know just


---------52:37----------
exercise and eat right don't listen to


---------52:38----------
your doctor he's giving you pills don't


---------52:39----------
take the pills but none of that should


---------52:41----------
work for me I know that shit's never


---------52:43----------
worked for me it was always seeking


---------52:44----------
genuine help and like being able to come


---------52:46----------
out of my own barrier and my own comfort


---------52:48----------
zone to accept that I need help and to


---------52:50----------
go forward with that and it sucks cuz


---------52:52----------
it's like I have to break through so


---------52:54----------
many learned behaviors that I was shamed


---------52:57----------
into into feeling like it like if it's


---------52:59----------
really tough it's really tough


---------53:02----------
yeah I'm gonna ask people if they've had


---------53:05----------
a similar experience but I just want to


---------53:07----------
comment for a second cuz you said you


---------53:08----------
had to break through your own barriers


---------53:10----------
to accept help I think they're really


---------53:12----------
insidious thing is you don't have to


---------53:13----------
break through your barriers you had to


---------53:15----------
break through the barriers that people


---------53:16----------
put around mm-hmm right like the idea


---------53:19----------
that you can't get help or that you


---------53:22----------
shouldn't get help or you know help is


---------53:24----------
for the weak is not something that came


---------53:26----------
from you it came from the people around


---------53:29----------
me and and I I just want to be a little


---------53:33----------
bit careful I'm a big fan of like


---------53:34----------
personal growth and overcoming your own


---------53:36----------
challenges but I'm what I'm hearing from


---------53:38----------
you guys pretty overwhelmingly is that


---------53:40----------
like the challenges that you guys face


---------53:42----------
or not ones that you put up its the


---------53:46----------
challenges that people put on you right


---------53:49----------
like 94% isn't good enough even 100


---------53:51----------
percent isn't good enough you've got to


---------53:53----------
do it like what about tomorrow you know


---------53:56----------
and and I think what I'm hearing from


---------53:58----------
you guys over and over and over again is


---------53:59----------
that it's not like it's not you it's the


---------54:02----------
people around you and the expectations


---------54:04----------
that you put on yourself and then


---------54:06----------
eventually you end up thinking like like


---------54:08----------
Hakeem does with like oh I'm a lazy


---------54:10----------
piece of [ __ ] and get my confidence back


---------54:13----------
I should do a project all on my own I'm


---------54:16----------
curious what are you the rest you guys


---------54:17----------
think about that I've been there and I


---------54:20----------
felt that so strongly especially when I


---------54:21----------
was you into seven years old because


---------54:22----------
when my teacher said I was lazy that's


---------54:26----------
because I couldn't focus in class


---------54:27----------
because I was not able to be the person


---------54:30----------
that my everybody tells me I need to be


---------54:32----------
to be successful in this life and that


---------54:33----------
made me feel as I can never really be


---------54:35----------
successful in my own personal dreams and


---------54:37----------
maybe on lose desire to do anything this


---------54:41----------
creative constructive or pursue anything


---------54:43----------
outside of academia because it felt as


---------54:45----------
though that was worthless the eyes of


---------54:47----------
everybody around me what do you guys do


---------54:49----------
like I can't place it


---------54:51----------
sorry never say I'm sorry the thing is


---------54:54----------
the lack of the belief was yes so what


---------54:56----------
do you guys think about our teens plan


---------54:58----------
and sorry if I'm sort of shifting gears


---------54:59----------
for a second but I just can't let this


---------55:01----------
slide because at the end of the day like


---------55:03----------
I feel like yeah I want to tackle


---------55:06----------
something with you guys and and I


---------55:08----------
noticed that I just can't help myself in


---------55:10----------
the sense that I get I get the sense


---------55:12----------
that I Keane is a little bit stuck right


---------55:13----------
now


---------55:14----------
and and we should think about that


---------55:16----------
because you all have felt that way too


---------55:17----------
and I can't sorry if I'm putting you on


---------55:20----------
the spot man


---------55:21----------
no it's great so like what do you guys


---------55:23----------
think about his plan of like finishing a


---------55:25----------
project on himself so he can build


---------55:27----------
confidence I understand why he feels the


---------55:32----------
need to do that because I kind of picked


---------55:34----------
on that myself


---------55:36----------
yeah just just with like general


---------55:39----------
schooling like like last like towards


---------55:44----------
the end I had a friend die and then my


---------55:47----------
grades dropped not really um so then the


---------55:50----------
next semester I didn't like accept help


---------55:52----------
from anyone else like I'm gonna do with


---------55:54----------
this mister myself to prove it I can't


---------55:56----------
continue being an engineer like I did a


---------55:59----------
lot better


---------56:06----------
other people are thoughts I've tried


---------56:10----------
I started writing everyday I think I'm


---------56:12----------
not sure if it was you I think it was


---------56:14----------
you motivating you start writing more


---------56:16----------
every day when I was watching one of


---------56:17----------
your strings but I that's one project


---------56:20----------
and I started drawing trying to be more


---------56:22----------
creative saw my own I wrote a first poem


---------56:23----------
I've read in years


---------56:24----------
I just tried I think that's my personal


---------56:26----------
product maybe but I couldn't understand


---------56:28----------
his need to do that to feel creative but


---------56:30----------
I mean fueled I can stick well well is


---------56:33----------
it doing it as a solution to get back on


---------56:35----------
track but for me work doing more work


---------56:38----------
has always been more inversely


---------56:40----------
proportional to my happiness


---------56:46----------
yeah I would agree with that as well and


---------56:49----------
so for me I've got like an assignment


---------56:52----------
dude in one month or whenever I look at


---------56:55----------
the top of the mountain okay I've got


---------56:56----------
five thousand requests to write it


---------56:57----------
sounds so crazy like ah how am I gonna


---------56:59----------
find the time um but breaking up into


---------57:02----------
small simple steps so I've got like some


---------57:06----------
productivity journals and I've been


---------57:08----------
reading a book called limitless by Jim


---------57:09----------
quick and he talks about something


---------57:12----------
called small simple steps so I always


---------57:15----------
think about okay what's a small thing


---------57:17----------
that I definitely can't feel it so it


---------57:19----------
might be okay


---------57:20----------
something really small okay let me open


---------57:21----------
up the word document okay let me write a


---------57:25----------
title let me write one sentence let me


---------57:27----------
search this journal let me search this


---------57:30----------
journal and every single time I hit one


---------57:33----------
of those accomplishments I feel a


---------57:35----------
greater sense of of calm confidence in


---------57:39----------
myself that okay I might be able to do


---------57:41----------
this so I hours out here also I could


---------57:46----------
not point that um a small project can


---------57:49----------
help you with confidence a key one thing


---------57:53----------
too that happened to me though in


---------57:54----------
relation to what you just expect what


---------57:55----------
you just said so I learned that too from


---------57:58----------
this book called Isola I'm not giving a


---------57:59----------
[ __ ] and I also went to the game with


---------58:00----------
him TED Talks and also dr. Kane talked


---------58:02----------
about being the bare minimum and that


---------58:04----------
was what got me start writing again but


---------58:06----------
I started having that before


---------58:08----------
when they came to those essays and


---------58:09----------
depression I was doing with those past


---------58:10----------
three months and I was dealing with so


---------58:13----------
it's like I couldn't I wasn't trying to


---------58:15----------
do that one word or those like English


---------58:17----------
tight like the title this feeling of I


---------58:20----------
couldn't breathe was rise up and ruin me


---------58:21----------
and I wouldn't even be able to do that


---------58:24----------
and I think that's something that has


---------58:27----------
taught me that I need to reevaluate a


---------58:29----------
lot of things about my life because I


---------58:31----------
was in the place where like I was saying


---------58:34----------
with the abuse and things why do I feel


---------58:36----------
as though there's no point even doing


---------58:37----------
this anymore I can't get myself do the


---------58:39----------
bare minimum and before I was able to


---------58:41----------
motivate myself using my mom's like how


---------58:43----------
how she had to work and how everything


---------58:45----------
she sacrificed to come to America and


---------58:47----------
everything she sacrificed for us to have


---------58:49----------
the life that we have I was able to let


---------58:51----------
that motivate me for a while but that


---------58:53----------
just doesn't work anymore and I was very


---------58:55----------
I became very spiritual - over the past


---------58:57----------
year after reading power of now learning


---------58:59----------
how to meditate and be able to have the


---------59:02----------
ability to bring mindfulness into each


---------59:04----------
moment that really helped me get through


---------59:06----------
the past year but for some reason to


---------59:08----------
stop being enough so let me let me just


---------59:11----------
ask I'm curious about that Eli but let


---------59:14----------
me just go back to a keen for a second


---------59:15----------
aki do you get the sense that so julian


---------59:18----------
use the phrase prove it I can do you get


---------59:20----------
the sense that like completing a project


---------59:22----------
on your own is proving something


---------59:25----------
absolutely what are you trying to prove


---------59:29----------
I mean on a very like like on a very


---------59:36----------
logical level I do like I do think I


---------59:40----------
actually need to prove that I can do the


---------59:42----------
work given that I was fired and it would


---------59:45----------
be a very good story to tell at my


---------59:48----------
interview that I completed a project and


---------59:50----------
have sole whatever issue got me fired in


---------59:53----------
the first place but then on a more


---------59:56----------
emotional level I like getting fired


---------59:59----------
from that job was kind of like the


---------60:01----------
natural culmination of like how I've


---------60:03----------
always done things I have always


---------60:05----------
happiness everything had been lazy for


---------60:07----------
literally my entire life and so I would


---------60:10----------
like to prove to myself that that is no


---------60:12----------
longer a thing at some point and I guess


---------60:15----------
I want this to be the proof of that so


---------60:20----------
I'm sure that your colleagues and


---------60:22----------
sympathize with that I'm kind of curious


---------60:25----------
Raymond when you were talking about you


---------60:27----------
know opening up the word document and


---------60:29----------
putting the title on there are you


---------60:30----------
trying to prove anything


---------60:33----------
yeah that I can't do something because


---------60:36----------
um I'm 23 now and I've been diagnosed


---------60:43----------
I'm not sure if is why is to say some of


---------60:47----------
the diagnosis of I've had but yeah


---------60:57----------
hopefully it helps someone and so I've


---------61:00----------
been diagnosed recently with ADHD


---------61:02----------
anxiety and depression and sorry an


---------61:07----------
adult age and yeah that felt weird to


---------61:13----------
say that um like whenever I told some


---------61:22----------
somebody does it feel it felt like an


---------61:26----------
excuse that I love the time when I was


---------61:28----------
like trying to read my textbooks I was


---------61:32----------
like okay how come I can't read this


---------61:34----------
trying to read for 20 minutes and how


---------61:37----------
come it's not going into my head I'll


---------61:38----------
try and read the again and I hear like a


---------61:40----------
bird outside wall and I get distracted I


---------61:43----------
have to focus back on the book and yeah


---------61:48----------
so and what was the question but yeah it


---------62:10----------
was limiting me and I kind of resented


---------62:12----------
it before that like I was always just


---------62:14----------
upset that I was a TD or everyone it was


---------62:16----------
affecting like my productivity and


---------62:19----------
everything and I don't really talk about


---------62:24----------
kind of them it sounds to me like what


---------62:30----------
you're feeling is that you know you


---------62:33----------
always knew that something was really


---------62:36----------
hard for you but your other people


---------62:38----------
didn't understand it and it was like


---------62:41----------
we're trying to tell people like hey


---------62:42----------
this is actually hard like I'm not I'm


---------62:45----------
not stupid


---------62:46----------
let me sit down and I work hard and the


---------62:49----------
letters just don't come into my head


---------62:51----------
after 20 minutes you know and then


---------62:53----------
people basically held you to a standard


---------62:57----------
that was not who you are


---------62:59----------
and it comes back to identity it's like


---------63:01----------
you tried to tell people who you are and


---------63:03----------
and what just think about this right


---------63:06----------
because we think about ADHD is an


---------63:08----------
illness or a deficiency and so it's even


---------63:11----------
weird for me to say like you are like


---------63:13----------
you were a completely normal human being


---------63:15----------
in that moment and the world didn't


---------63:17----------
treat you that way and it can be hard


---------63:21----------
for you to find a reason and even then I


---------63:25----------
don't I don't know if you guys have seen


---------63:26----------
me like talk about ADHD before but I


---------63:29----------
think basically like you guys aren't ill


---------63:32----------
it's just your brain is not designed to


---------63:35----------
look at a text book for an hour because


---------63:38----------
there are lots of different brains and


---------63:40----------
and like when we were evolving like no


---------63:43----------
human being had to sit in one place for


---------63:45----------
an hour and stare at one object and and


---------63:49----------
I kind of talked a little bit about


---------63:50----------
hunters versus farmers and hunters or


---------63:53----------
people that are taking in a lot of


---------63:55----------
different stimuli and new environments


---------63:57----------
and then there are farmers that like to


---------63:59----------
wake up the same time every day and do


---------64:01----------
the same thing every day until they die


---------64:03----------
and there are different kinds of brains


---------64:06----------
many people are wondering you know


---------64:08----------
Raymond is a toughie which is kind of


---------64:11----------
interesting because your ADHD is about


---------64:13----------
that kind of mindset but but yeah I mean


---------64:17----------
I think what I'm hearing from you


---------64:19----------
Raymond is really that like it feels


---------64:21----------
somewhat liberating together a diagnosis


---------64:24----------
is that fair yeah I would definitely


---------64:27----------
agree with that because all this time I


---------64:29----------
was told that I was late lazy I'm not


---------64:31----------
trying hard enough even though I'll try


---------64:33----------
ok let me read this textbook for 2 hours


---------64:35----------
but it's just not going in I'm trying my


---------64:37----------
hardest place it was it was so difficult


---------64:40----------
but it kind of felt like a sense of


---------64:42----------
relief that okay there's something I can


---------64:44----------
do about it it's not it's not that I'm


---------64:46----------
hopeless it's something I can work on


---------64:49----------
and yeah that bus world say own it for


---------64:53----------
sure


---------64:54----------
I can walk with Moses I was it sorry


---------64:57----------
what was this wants me to ask Alfons or


---------65:00----------
think it's Julius I'm sure you want


---------65:02----------
Julian yeah he wants us to see if you


---------65:04----------
can use your phone on your webcam mic or


---------65:06----------
your phone oh I'll try the right now


---------65:10----------
thanks Eli hello hey still hear me yeah


---------65:14----------
yeah better all right good fixed thanks


---------65:21----------
Eli so I can't let me ask you something


---------65:23----------
how long have you felt like you're a


---------65:24----------
lazy piece of [ __ ] I'm trying to


---------65:29----------
remember if there was a time where I was


---------65:38----------
like seven or eight or so right so like


---------65:44----------
I'm kind of curious like you know when


---------65:48----------
were you guys taught these things about


---------65:51----------
yourself you feel - it's like when you


---------65:56----------
fail to perform I guess and you feel


---------65:58----------
that you fail to perform precision gauge


---------66:00----------
because math was something I really


---------66:02----------
struggle with as a kid so you have it's


---------66:04----------
reinforced in me since I was a child


---------66:05----------
because my mom would get angry at me for


---------66:07----------
not doing well when I was younger but I


---------66:09----------
tried to get help with my met with


---------66:11----------
schoolwork but it never really more


---------66:14----------
fruit also I found a teacher as a Poulos


---------66:17----------
compatible with as a person who


---------66:18----------
understood how I learned and I got lucky


---------66:20----------
- yeah I've gotten that when I was in


---------66:21----------
the fifth grade for my because although


---------66:23----------
I almost got held back because I had to


---------66:25----------
go to counseling for depression for two


---------66:27----------
weeks


---------66:27----------
and my grades dropped while I was away


---------66:29----------
now in two weeks I think was longer than


---------66:31----------
that but I was away from school for a


---------66:32----------
while because they sent me to get


---------66:34----------
counseling for depression at this


---------66:35----------
program and they were sending in my


---------66:37----------
homework or somehow somehow I said


---------66:39----------
started up failing for that year and I


---------66:41----------
had to go with this math tutor who I end


---------66:45----------
up actually becoming close to as a male


---------66:47----------
mentor because I don't have a father at


---------66:49----------
home so is that kind of less like a


---------66:51----------
pseudo father figure that I had at the


---------66:53----------
time Julian you wanted to say something


---------67:01----------
basically like my dad was always like I


---------67:03----------
would always work with it and you're


---------67:04----------
like construction jobs basically and I


---------67:08----------
would my brother he's a little bit young


---------67:10----------
he'd do something like lately wrong and


---------67:12----------
I'm like you know like he can get away


---------67:13----------
with that like why can't I my dad Julian


---------67:17----------
just stopped half-assing everything like


---------67:18----------
constantly the girl was always like the


---------67:20----------
freight it's like I was just always told


---------67:22----------
that I was a lazy piece of [ __ ] and I


---------67:25----------
was having everything and it wasn't like


---------67:28----------
I got out of that environment when I was


---------67:30----------
able to like figure out like no I can't


---------67:33----------
be a productive person that's possible


---------67:41----------
I'm sorry but Julian is it possible to


---------67:44----------
change your mic to the webcam because


---------67:46----------
you turned on your webcam but it


---------67:48----------
actually didn't change the microphone


---------67:50----------
okay yeah your webcam may not have just


---------67:55----------
like an inbuilt microphone or the


---------67:58----------
alternative is to use like a mobile


---------68:00----------
device phone for discord


---------68:03----------
oh I'm sorry I didn't realize you're


---------68:04----------
typing in the phones pound see I'm not


---------68:10----------
the only boomer a way to talk okay now


---------68:29----------
you're meeting uh you know why you may


---------68:33----------
have to move this is gonna be kind of


---------68:34----------
weird turn the webcam off but move the


---------68:37----------
webcam closer to you if you can


---------68:46----------
phone okay does that have discordant you


---------68:53----------
can't hear you yeah you're muted and


---------68:59----------
he's gonna try to connect through this


---------69:00----------
one yeah oh saved okay beautiful


---------69:05----------
pause noise thank you thanks Moses yeah


---------69:13----------
I mean I I think it just comes back like


---------69:15----------
I'm just hearing this theme over and


---------69:16----------
over again about like you guys are just


---------69:18----------
not allowed to be yourselves you know


---------69:21----------
whether it's whether it's race or


---------69:23----------
whether it's like parental expectations


---------69:25----------
or whether it's like mental health


---------69:27----------
issues or you know like religious


---------69:30----------
beliefs or you know like a minute start


---------69:33----------
so young like I really don't I mean I


---------69:37----------
don't I think that lazy piece of [ __ ] is


---------69:40----------
just a poor diagnostic term it's how we


---------69:44----------
feel because we don't understand what's


---------69:46----------
going on right it's like telling someone


---------69:48----------
who has cancer that they're weak because


---------69:50----------
no one understands what cancer is it's


---------69:53----------
like there's something that's getting in


---------69:54----------
the way of you being the person that


---------69:56----------
like you can be and you know I I'm not


---------70:02----------
sure exactly yeah I'm kind of curious I


---------70:05----------
mean what what has been y'all's


---------70:07----------
experience so it sounds like for Raymond


---------70:09----------
it was like sort of liberating to


---------70:10----------
certain kind of find a diagnosis and get


---------70:13----------
a sense of like you know some of the the


---------70:16----------
way that his brain is wired what's it


---------70:18----------
been like for you guys what's been


---------70:19----------
y'all's experience with sort of


---------70:21----------
interacting with the mental health


---------70:22----------
system is always been terrible I tried


---------70:27----------
to keep therapy a lot growing up and


---------70:29----------
mostly they told me I should just try


---------70:31----------
fitting in those try being like


---------70:33----------
everybody else and my brother were


---------70:35----------
looking nothing I told him that they


---------70:36----------
told me that he told me to stop seeing


---------70:38----------
them and but I've learned I listened to


---------70:40----------
you recently when you said you should


---------70:41----------
work with the therapist to let them know


---------70:42----------
when what they're seeing isn't helping


---------70:45----------
you and try to have that proper dialogue


---------70:47----------
with them and now for my like if I


---------70:50----------
pursue therapy in the future I'll


---------70:51----------
definitely try to do that previously I


---------70:53----------
did try to do that in some ways but it


---------70:55----------
didn't bear any fruit and I feel like


---------70:56----------
we'll probably best for me to end those


---------70:58----------
relationships like way I did


---------70:59----------
definitely something to consider in the


---------71:00----------
future well what's yeah


---------71:07----------
it's been difficult knowing that I'm


---------71:10----------
bipolar feels like I have a permanent


---------71:13----------
debuff but it's working around that


---------71:15----------
debuff that inspires me it gives me a


---------71:19----------
lot of anxiety when I think about the


---------71:21----------
future especially I think that's my


---------71:22----------
number one problem as a person I can't


---------71:24----------
stop thinking about the future and that


---------71:26----------
scares me because I don't want to go


---------71:27----------
manic again and I'm afraid of going


---------71:29----------
manic again and I'm afraid of the


---------71:32----------
feelings that come around being bipolar


---------71:34----------
and I'm afraid of the results of those


---------71:36----------
actions like so for me personally before


---------71:38----------
I was diagnosed I had a really bad manic


---------71:39----------
episode and they're like the trauma


---------71:43----------
behind that episode and the results of


---------71:44----------
that episode still reverberate today and


---------71:46----------
so it's it's liberating in the sense


---------71:49----------
that now I know what's wrong with me


---------71:51----------
and I get it and I totally understand


---------71:52----------
that and I'm working with a doctor to


---------71:54----------
help that but it's still it still feels


---------71:57----------
like a debuff it still feels like a


---------71:58----------
monkey on my back but I just can't get


---------71:59----------
rid of I'm wondering if I'm hearing like


---------72:03----------
another like point in the favor of it


---------72:05----------
shouldn't be this way like that's


---------72:08----------
another theme I've heard from you guys


---------72:09----------
what do you feel strong feeling yeah


---------72:12----------
yeah I didn't ask for this for sure like


---------72:15----------
it certainly feels like you know I


---------72:16----------
didn't ask for this [ __ ]


---------72:17----------
but and now it's like learning how to


---------72:19----------
deal with that [ __ ] what do you guys do


---------72:22----------
when the world is just an unfair place


---------72:24----------
and life is a [ __ ] game where you you


---------72:26----------
know you got a randomly generated


---------72:28----------
character and you're like stats or all I


---------72:29----------
worked it's kind of make the best of it


---------72:34----------
so I would do a whole journey of finding


---------72:40----------
myself since I was 13 it went through


---------72:43----------
self-help I got addicted to


---------72:44----------
self-development and whatnot and I was


---------72:47----------
reading a lot of self-help books for a


---------72:48----------
very long time I fell into like 20


---------72:50----------
Robbins and reading books on like having


---------72:52----------
friends my first one I ever read was


---------72:54----------
however in friends influence people and


---------72:56----------
yeah then I would go on from there and


---------72:59----------
we can be alchemists and I was my


---------73:00----------
favorite book of all time the book


---------73:02----------
they're really saving for myself and I


---------73:04----------
would say that it was the thing I did


---------73:07----------
when they were old for like an unfair


---------73:08----------
place was try to create a a person that


---------73:10----------
would like to be the person I could look


---------73:11----------
up to try to be the father to myself


---------73:13----------
I didn't have growing up and those


---------73:16----------
through reading books and trying to look


---------73:18----------
through our lists like people like Alan


---------73:19----------
Watts or the book house as a man


---------73:22----------
thinketh by James Allen looking for help


---------73:26----------
looking for answers I would say it was -


---------73:28----------
looking for answers died trying to find


---------73:30----------
it but try to find who I was and kept on


---------73:33----------
putting myself out there and I grew up


---------73:35----------
very awkward because I didn't have that


---------73:36----------
many friends and II know many people so


---------73:38----------
I challenged myself often to meet new


---------73:40----------
people however I was really bad talking


---------73:41----------
to girls especially me and my dating


---------73:43----------
life or something that I wanted to get


---------73:44----------
right and it was do telling myself to


---------73:46----------
talk to girls and mess up over and over


---------73:48----------
and over again learn about it and learn


---------73:50----------
to see them first of all he knew his


---------73:51----------
human beings because that's something


---------73:52----------
that you definitely not taught when


---------73:54----------
governor talks I'm asking the household


---------73:55----------
but um it was to learning that and


---------73:58----------
having female friends and going through


---------74:00----------
so many different things and learning to


---------74:03----------
love even if that even if those people


---------74:06----------
that you love hate you just because the


---------74:08----------
way you look June to love them anyway


---------74:09----------
that's what have really helped me and


---------74:11----------
choosen to find things that makes me


---------74:13----------
happy in my worst moments like music and


---------74:14----------
art so I know I think it's it's tricky


---------74:18----------
because like on the one hand I hear Eli


---------74:21----------
talking I'm curious what you guys think


---------74:22----------
about this and I hear him say like I


---------74:24----------
taught myself to be the you know the


---------74:26----------
father that I'd like to be my own father


---------74:29----------
to be to be the father that I didn't


---------74:31----------
have and that sounds like so


---------74:32----------
inspirational and at the same time I


---------74:35----------
feel like it's like kind of crushing -


---------74:39----------
what do y'all how do y'all feel about


---------74:41----------
that statement I mean it seems


---------74:43----------
significant to me I thought it was


---------74:45----------
significant to you guys I think like


---------74:49----------
obviously I resonate with that a lot


---------74:51----------
because I see that I can think about it


---------74:52----------
a lot like I would just think about what


---------74:54----------
things that could have been different


---------74:55----------
about my childhood that I could change


---------74:57----------
and be different but the weird thing is


---------74:59----------
like my dad probably had those same


---------75:01----------
thoughts you know anything like um his


---------75:03----------
dad was like far worse than him and he


---------75:05----------
tells me about it and you he's trying to


---------75:07----------
be better and I understand but when I


---------75:10----------
know that my dad also had similar


---------75:11----------
thoughts and like this is still the


---------75:13----------
outcome like it kind of worries me a bit


---------75:15----------
like for how I might turn out moer you


---------75:19----------
or even there he might turn out I'm all


---------75:23----------
the time


---------75:25----------
I got worried I because I do everything


---------75:27----------
in my power to not be my father and I


---------75:29----------
try my best to not fit into any mold but


---------75:32----------
it's difficult because I feel like I'm


---------75:34----------
constantly trying to adapt and if you


---------75:36----------
like I'm constantly trying to fit the


---------75:38----------
needs of what I need at the moment in


---------75:39----------
time but it's difficult I I feel like


---------75:42----------
sometimes I lose myself in the process


---------75:44----------
and I'm very scared of that and I forget


---------75:48----------
like what is the real me anymore


---------75:49----------
sometimes and it's difficult because I'm


---------75:52----------
afraid of things like like like


---------75:54----------
childbirth and like being a father can I


---------75:56----------
be a father with Bipolar I don't know


---------75:58----------
it's it's difficult and those things


---------76:00----------
really influence how I think a lot what


---------76:03----------
do you guys think what do you guys think


---------76:05----------
the real mo is I think most awesome


---------76:09----------
person these I know based on how genuine


---------76:17----------
he has been to me in this day few days


---------76:18----------
I've known him we spoke a little bit


---------76:22----------
yesterday and he's just a great person


---------76:23----------
from like a few interactions a god what


---------76:26----------
makes him a great person what about


---------76:27----------
those interactions I have a sister with


---------76:30----------
bipolar depression and he reminds me a


---------76:33----------
lot of Harriet like my sister is like a


---------76:34----------
wonderful and joyful caring person and I


---------76:37----------
love her very much so like Moe exhibits


---------76:39----------
a lot of those qualities so I just like


---------76:41----------
I think he's great same year my brother


---------76:44----------
like my brother also has bipolar


---------76:45----------
disorder and he's also a be the same way


---------76:48----------
in that way yeah and uh Moe my sister


---------76:52----------
also has kids it's possible to be a


---------76:54----------
parent with bipolar like it's hard


---------76:56----------
obviously but it's not possible I'm


---------77:01----------
gonna cry


---------77:02----------
a lot thank you guys thank you what did


---------77:05----------
that mean to you mo that validation is


---------77:09----------
really nice that validation is super


---------77:12----------
important and like I don't hear it


---------77:15----------
enough I think the worst of myself and


---------77:17----------
I'm far too hard on myself and I don't


---------77:19----------
like that I always think of the worst in


---------77:21----------
the negative situations and it's really


---------77:24----------
nice to have that validation validation


---------77:27----------
feels to me like an understatement had


---------77:35----------
what do you feel no give us another word


---------77:39----------
for it or a lot of words that are all


---------77:42----------
off the mark needed I feel justified I


---------77:52----------
feel like I'm uh


---------77:53----------
I feel right I feel accepted I feel like


---------77:57----------
I'm in a place where I'm supposed to be


---------77:58----------
when I hear those things I feel like I'm


---------78:01----------
doing something right and that's really


---------78:03----------
it it's it's it's hard and like I've


---------78:06----------
always had love and appreciation from


---------78:08----------
from other people and I do my best to


---------78:10----------
spread that around as well and I mean I


---------78:13----------
call myself a great big hug because I


---------78:14----------
try to be a great big hug all the time


---------78:15----------
and like it's sometimes you just need


---------78:20----------
that reflection and so it's nice because


---------78:22----------
I want to believe that what I bring out


---------78:24----------
into the world is coming back to me I


---------78:25----------
want to feel like I'm doing something


---------78:27----------
right and so when I get that validation


---------78:28----------
it really feels like I'm doing good


---------78:30----------
it means a lot of people give that


---------78:32----------
validation when you had the child of


---------78:34----------
childhood is that a huge mo and everyone


---------78:36----------
here in this chat has ADD and I do I'm


---------78:38----------
so who deals like this more this for you


---------78:40----------
I think is what it's called and since I


---------78:41----------
didn't look the way I look now growing


---------78:43----------
up and I get validation externally


---------78:45----------
I don't believe - I don't see myself the


---------78:47----------
way the world sees man you and I got


---------78:49----------
compliments growing up because of how


---------78:50----------
even I did well at home with school I


---------78:54----------
didn't if you were like the rewards as I


---------78:56----------
said but didn't weight negatives and now


---------78:59----------
when I get compliments I can never


---------79:00----------
really like feel the joy of the


---------79:02----------
compliment the only time I really felt


---------79:05----------
seen was when my mentor told me that he


---------79:07----------
sees how much I care about people and if


---------79:09----------
for the first time I like that someone


---------79:11----------
actually saw me for the person I was


---------79:13----------
because growing up all I ever wanted to


---------79:15----------
understand was why we hurt each


---------79:16----------
so much why we can't spread love fully


---------79:18----------
and why we can learn to love responsibly


---------79:20----------
and why do we have to spend so much hate


---------79:23----------
ask you something what was it like to


---------79:26----------
hear Moe's response to what y'all said


---------79:30----------
it was beautiful


---------79:31----------
yeah really wholesome what was well


---------79:38----------
liked um I'm glad we could like give him


---------79:40----------
like that validation I guess a well you


---------79:43----------
said it wasn't necessarily validation


---------79:45----------
but I'm glad like my experience is along


---------79:48----------
with everyone else's like could help


---------79:50----------
someone like understand themselves are


---------79:53----------
like understand how people view them


---------79:54----------
more because I struggle with that like a


---------79:55----------
lot and I've only recently started like


---------79:58----------
understanding how people view me and I


---------80:00----------
know how great that feels so I'm glad we


---------80:03----------
could like help Moe like experience that


---------80:05----------
cause it's great mm-hmm does anybody


---------80:08----------
feel a little bit confused or left out


---------80:10----------
of this exchange um I wouldn't say I


---------80:17----------
feel confused but like I cuz I this is


---------80:24----------
like a normal thing for me but like I'm


---------80:26----------
just very emotionally detached in


---------80:31----------
general so like a lot of things just


---------80:34----------
don't hit the same for me yeah and I


---------80:36----------
don't like see things the same way so


---------80:38----------
that's just like normal for me yeah what


---------80:43----------
do you think about that Aki um I was I


---------80:47----------
was actually just thinking like I feel


---------80:50----------
like I don't really I don't really feel


---------80:56----------
like a lot of the emotions that I think


---------81:00----------
are probably there on the inside but


---------81:02----------
like I feel like listening to all of you


---------81:04----------
guys I feel like I'm it's almost like


---------81:08----------
getting a mirror that lets me get an


---------81:10----------
idea of how I probably actually do feel


---------81:12----------
about things because everything you're


---------81:14----------
saying like on some level it feels like


---------81:17----------
it relates and it makes sense and I'm


---------81:19----------
just like okay these are just things I


---------81:20----------
can't see for myself for whatever reason


---------81:22----------
but when you guys say it it all makes


---------81:24----------
sense and I'm like okay now it all ties


---------81:27----------
together


---------81:29----------
this is what party XP looks like by the


---------81:31----------
way right so I I think this is why I


---------81:36----------
think yeah I mean you know I think


---------81:40----------
individual work is really important but


---------81:42----------
I think that I can imagine that if I was


---------81:45----------
speaking to anyone of you one-on-one we


---------81:47----------
would have gone down a particular rabbit


---------81:49----------
hole and and you know hopefully it would


---------81:52----------
have been helpful but I think that there


---------81:54----------
is something that you guys can give each


---------81:56----------
other that I can't give you right


---------82:00----------
there's something about you know I can


---------82:02----------
try to be a mirror but I don't really


---------82:05----------
know and to a certain degree I kind of


---------82:07----------
know but like you know I don't really


---------82:10----------
know what it's like to grow up black


---------82:12----------
minority sure toxic masculinity sure a


---------82:17----------
culture that sort of has very strict


---------82:19----------
gender rules and ideas about what men


---------82:22----------
should be sure you know but I think


---------82:25----------
that's you know part of that it really


---------82:26----------
is just humanity because it's not like


---------82:29----------
toxic masculinity in a particular


---------82:31----------
culture it's like masculinity as whole


---------82:33----------
you sometimes be toxic anything that you


---------82:39----------
guys want to kind of explore further I


---------82:41----------
mean we've been at it for a little over


---------82:43----------
an hour anybody have questions for each


---------82:46----------
other for me or has anybody has anybody


---------82:52----------
been told you're a smut guy you're just


---------82:55----------
lazy


---------82:57----------
almost it's not your fault you're a


---------83:02----------
smart guy you're just lazy all the time


---------83:10----------
I push it a lot if it's true like but


---------83:13----------
then like I'll notice like my


---------83:15----------
accomplishments and I'll be like yeah


---------83:16----------
like I'm kind of smart and sometimes you


---------83:19----------
know I always do it it feels like a


---------83:24----------
burden of expectation yeah and it feels


---------83:26----------
like it feels like I like you know I'm


---------83:29----------
not on my true potential just because


---------83:30----------
I'm lazy or I'm not on my trip potential


---------83:32----------
because these things are holding me back


---------83:33----------
but that's never the case and that's why


---------83:35----------
I always think it's just such a [ __ ]


---------83:37----------
when I very hear that I heard that's so


---------83:38----------
often growing up I hate it and it still


---------83:40----------
pisses me off when I hear that and he


---------83:42----------
leaves this feeling there's always


---------83:43----------
something you should be doing and makes


---------83:45----------
what you do like what you're doing right


---------83:46----------
now even it's relaxing you can make you


---------83:48----------
feel like it's never enough and that


---------83:50----------
sense of you're a smart guy you're just


---------83:51----------
lazy


---------83:52----------
it proved it's a pervasive and insidious


---------83:55----------
killer in the sense that it makes even


---------83:57----------
when you actually do work hard on


---------83:59----------
something you doubt if your full effort


---------84:02----------
was really even put to it and when you


---------84:04----------
talk about procrastination as being the


---------84:06----------
smart thing to do dr. K it made me


---------84:08----------
recognize that that's why broke my


---------84:10----------
childhood it became more and more the


---------84:12----------
thing where I've grasped me more and


---------84:14----------
more and more and more as years gone


---------84:15----------
would go by because I'd find that my


---------84:17----------
emotion most my emotional state would be


---------84:19----------
better the mark ratain ated


---------84:21----------
simultaneously as the work ethic Liz


---------84:23----------
that yeah I would get a good grade on


---------84:24----------
something I do and study on this because


---------84:26----------
in nature they actually pay attention in


---------84:27----------
class but that would leave a bad habit


---------84:30----------
to grow where I don't study or don't do


---------84:33----------
though premeditative work that needs to


---------84:35----------
be done because the fact that what those


---------84:37----------
mean you're smart you're just lazy yeah


---------84:39----------
I think I think smart but lazy is the


---------84:42----------
most damning diagnosis someone can get


---------84:47----------
because it leaves this idea that it's


---------84:50----------
you have it within you to do it but


---------84:53----------
you're just [ __ ] dumb so you're not


---------84:56----------
doing it I mean my take on smart but


---------84:58----------
lazy and and I don't know if this is


---------85:00----------
gonna make sense it's just kind of an


---------85:01----------
image popped into my mind it's sort of


---------85:02----------
like if you guys played like or we yeah


---------85:07----------
there's like it's like kind of like you


---------85:09----------
guys are living life and everyone's


---------85:10----------
telling you to use the buttons on the


---------85:11----------
controller but what you've really got is


---------85:13----------
a wiimote and you have an entire input


---------85:16----------
axis that like other people aren't


---------85:18----------
wearer and sometimes you use the Wiimote


---------85:21----------
the way it's supposed to be used and


---------85:22----------
everyone


---------85:23----------
telling you to just hit the buttons but


---------85:24----------
when you Excel it's like because you're


---------85:26----------
moving the Wiimote around and there are


---------85:28----------
just parts of you that you guys have not


---------85:30----------
found yet and and so what happens is


---------85:34----------
people see that you can absolutely


---------85:35----------
perform at a very high level and the


---------85:39----------
problem is not that you guys are dumb


---------85:41----------
the problem is that you're not able to


---------85:43----------
access that which you have been able to


---------85:46----------
do before and and so it's it's not


---------85:51----------
really like it's not that y'all are bad


---------85:53----------
or dumb or lazy or anything like that


---------85:54----------
it's just there's something about the


---------85:56----------
way that you work that y'all don't


---------85:58----------
understand yet definitely and I would I


---------86:03----------
would be really careful about you know


---------86:05----------
so I also kind of sympathize with Aki


---------86:08----------
and sort of the idea of like I'm gonna


---------86:09----------
prove myself and then dot-dot-dot


---------86:12----------
right like I want you guys to be really


---------86:15----------
careful about the and then like Moe's


---------86:18----------
like I'm gonna get my mental health in


---------86:19----------
order and then maybe I'll have kids like


---------86:23----------
be really careful about this idea that


---------86:25----------
you're gonna be ready to take the next


---------86:27----------
step before you take the next step you


---------86:28----------
want to be confident in taking the next


---------86:31----------
step before you take it but I want y'all


---------86:36----------
to really tunnel down and like pay


---------86:38----------
attention to what Raymond said and and


---------86:40----------
also what Eli is kind of mentioned is


---------86:41----------
that like he sort of takes the next step


---------86:44----------
before he's ready


---------86:45----------
like he just opens up the word document


---------86:46----------
there's no mater readiness you know you


---------86:49----------
live life in a way that you're not ready


---------86:51----------
to take the next step you just take it


---------86:53----------
the other last thing that I want to tell


---------86:55----------
you guys I don't know if you'll know


---------86:56----------
this but you guys are really really good


---------86:58----------
at being thrust into situations that


---------86:59----------
you're poorly prepared for ie being life


---------87:02----------
being born in life as a black person


---------87:06----------
which no one prepared you for right no


---------87:11----------
like we don't get prepared for the life


---------87:14----------
that we get thrust into and like it's


---------87:17----------
not just being born a black person it's


---------87:18----------
just like being born now like we guys


---------87:20----------
were born you know it like with post


---------87:22----------
boomer generation and it's like this is


---------87:26----------
what you all have been thrust into a


---------87:28----------
world where like mental health is like


---------87:31----------
climbing at a crazy rate so when I


---------87:33----------
started working with video game a


---------87:35----------
addict's it's not really a great term


---------87:38----------
but can you you guys know what the


---------87:39----------
percentage of people who are addicted to


---------87:42----------
video games was so I started working


---------87:43----------
with backpack with in 2016


---------87:46----------
worldwide what percentage of people do


---------87:48----------
you guys think we're addicted to video


---------87:49----------
games in 2016 like 5% simple said see


---------87:55----------
look at that you got tonight at this


---------87:56----------
what a guy store percentage is four


---------87:59----------
years later 20 is still 5% it's actually


---------88:06----------
like 9% so I'll take the first one but


---------88:09----------
there are so interestingly enough Moe in


---------88:11----------
Iran the addiction rate is close to 20%


---------88:15----------
no idea why yeah so like things are


---------88:20----------
getting worse


---------88:21----------
in a in a shocking rate but I think I


---------88:25----------
you know it's cool like I I think how


---------88:28----------
can I say this so first of all any


---------88:32----------
questions anyone else want anything else


---------88:34----------
and that was a great question by the way


---------88:35----------
Moe just about you know being told


---------88:37----------
you're smart lazy cuz it's absolutely


---------88:39----------
something that and that's not I mean


---------88:40----------
that has nothing to do with you guys


---------88:41----------
being black and has to do with us being


---------88:43----------
on Twitch


---------88:44----------
it's like what we get told yeah totally


---------88:47----------
I I did have a question like related to


---------88:51----------
the identity thing so like a lot of what


---------88:55----------
you guys are saying is like you can't


---------88:56----------
you feel like you can't be yourself and


---------88:59----------
it's interesting to me because all of


---------89:02----------
the stuff that you're kind of being told


---------89:05----------
that you have to be I feel like I just


---------89:08----------
internalized all those things and like


---------89:10----------
that is what I consider myself like


---------89:12----------
people say I'm supposed to be smart so


---------89:13----------
I'm like I already have the smart guy


---------89:15----------
people say I'm supposed to be masculine


---------89:16----------
all right then I'm gonna be the stoic


---------89:18----------
guy so like I don't even know how to


---------89:20----------
draw the line between people's


---------89:22----------
expectations of identity and what my


---------89:25----------
identity actually is I that makes me


---------89:31----------
think of what dr. K talked about enology


---------89:34----------
he used for was like for a trans person


---------89:35----------
to be trans and he said what you can do


---------89:38----------
is go into the bathroom and we're all


---------89:40----------
male clothes and well not female clothes


---------89:43----------
well wear women's clothes red dress were


---------89:45----------
abroad


---------89:47----------
see how you that makes you feel you feel


---------89:49----------
uncomfortable that's our trans person


---------89:51----------
feels they look in the mirror every


---------89:52----------
single day I think of when people gave


---------89:55----------
me those compliments he told me those


---------89:56----------
things about myself I felt really


---------89:59----------
uncomfortable because I just didn't feel


---------90:00----------
like that's who I was because the


---------90:02----------
reality that I was living didn't feel


---------90:04----------
like we resemble the things I was being


---------90:05----------
told and well people perceived me and


---------90:07----------
I'm not even I'm someone who like has


---------90:09----------
really balanced energy between masculine


---------90:11----------
and feminine validity and I find that my


---------90:14----------
experience has been that the more


---------90:16----------
masculine as people made me feel that I


---------90:19----------
had to be the more uncomfortable I was


---------90:21----------
especially more I tried to force myself


---------90:23----------
to be that person especially any dating


---------90:25----------
is like the feeling that you have to be


---------90:27----------
hyper masculine to get women to be into


---------90:29----------
you it was a big struggle for a very


---------90:32----------
long time and so I became 17 I was


---------90:34----------
really having a proper dialogue ruin my


---------90:36----------
life and you don't understand that the


---------90:38----------
best thing I can do for myself would be


---------90:39----------
a better version of myself what do you


---------90:47----------
guys think about you know I came talking


---------90:50----------
about like how do you know where you


---------90:53----------
exist when when you sort of form your


---------90:56----------
opinions about yourself based on


---------90:58----------
expectations like you become the


---------91:00----------
expectation that's what you think you


---------91:01----------
are is that something that you guys have


---------91:05----------
experienced more or struggled with I


---------91:10----------
have liked a lot recently um like before


---------91:14----------
like like like within the past year have


---------91:17----------
been like kind of working on it and


---------91:18----------
trying to figure out like what kind of


---------91:20----------
is my place in the world Who I am like


---------91:21----------
what my dynamic is and like a friend


---------91:24----------
group and everything and it was fine


---------91:27----------
until like I think my therapist


---------91:28----------
basically told me don't worry about that


---------91:30----------
like if the people around you didn't


---------91:32----------
want to be around to you like you don't


---------91:34----------
don't worry about like if they didn't


---------91:35----------
want to be around like they just


---------91:36----------
wouldn't so you don't have to worry


---------91:37----------
about like how you fit in where your


---------91:39----------
place is you can just find it because no


---------91:41----------
one really knows like how exactly like


---------91:43----------
other people perceive them and what they


---------91:46----------
liked you know and I was [ __ ] like my


---------91:50----------
really close friend Spencer and we were


---------91:52----------
talking about like the idea of like who


---------91:54----------
we are in identity he was like kind of


---------91:57----------
explain to each other like uh who we


---------91:59----------
think each other are but when


---------92:01----------
did we both realize like we just have


---------92:02----------
vastly different ideas of who we think


---------92:04----------
the other person is so like we no one


---------92:07----------
really knows kind of just a guessing


---------92:08----------
game


---------92:12----------
does anybody have a sense so it sounds


---------92:15----------
like Eli's done a lot of kind of


---------92:17----------
exploration and sort of discovering


---------92:19----------
Korea's I'm curious does anybody else


---------92:22----------
have a sense of like do you guys feel


---------92:24----------
like you know who you are


---------92:25----------
I feel I feel pretty confident in my


---------92:30----------
self-image sometimes but it's difficult


---------92:32----------
when it doesn't mesh well with other


---------92:34----------
people's sense of who I am as a person I


---------92:37----------
feel like I conflict a lot with others


---------92:38----------
when someone sees me coming from a


---------92:40----------
traditional African family then but I'm


---------92:43----------
not so traditional myself then I feel


---------92:45----------
like that's where I struggle with a lot


---------92:46----------
it's just how did you not have who you


---------92:48----------
are


---------92:51----------
mylord I'm through a lot through going


---------92:55----------
to university through meeting and dating


---------92:57----------
so many different people through


---------92:59----------
experiencing different traumatic events


---------93:00----------
in my life through you know so many


---------93:03----------
different experiences that I think


---------93:04----------
shaped myself including my bipolar


---------93:06----------
disorder like I I think someone asked me


---------93:09----------
a question recently where would you want


---------93:12----------
more or less pain in your childhood but


---------93:14----------
I think without that pain I wouldn't


---------93:16----------
have been the same person that I am now


---------93:18----------
so it's difficult it's it's I think I


---------93:21----------
would say I truly discovered myself at


---------93:25----------
the time I found my bipolar disorder


---------93:26----------
that's that's where I would kind of like


---------93:28----------
tie it all in yeah so you know I hope


---------93:36----------
that


---------93:37----------
take away there isn't the road to


---------93:38----------
finding yourself is to get diagnosed


---------93:40----------
with bipolar disorder so I think I think


---------93:46----------
I think the key thing there is that you


---------93:48----------
know so I think for people who are


---------93:50----------
trying to figure out who you are I think


---------93:51----------
we we can hear from kind of Eli and Mo


---------93:55----------
is that like first of all and also


---------93:57----------
Raymond too cuz I get the sense that


---------93:58----------
he's getting a real handle on it now is


---------94:01----------
I hope you guys hear that these are


---------94:02----------
incredibly individual journeys and like


---------94:04----------
what the [ __ ] did you guys expect when


---------94:07----------
it comes to finding out who your ID a


---------94:09----------
unique identity is you think that


---------94:10----------
there's a standard formula for it like


---------94:12----------
the whole point is that it's individual


---------94:13----------
right like it's your identity it's no


---------94:16----------
one else's identity so why is anyone


---------94:17----------
else's story like you can learn how to


---------94:19----------
write poetry and talk to women you can


---------94:21----------
get diagnosed with ADHD and and start to


---------94:25----------
like you know have a job and work in


---------94:26----------
boardrooms or you can get diagnosed with


---------94:29----------
bipolar disorder like those are all


---------94:30----------
equally good answers and I think I came


---------94:34----------
you know the challenges that that


---------94:36----------
doesn't really give you a way forward


---------94:37----------
because I get I guess on some level what


---------94:39----------
I'm hearing between reading the lines


---------94:42----------
between your question it's like how do I


---------94:44----------
find out who I am because you've noticed


---------94:47----------
that your sense of self is based it's


---------94:51----------
built upon the expectations of others


---------94:55----------
but that's not who you are right and


---------94:59----------
then you're like then how do I find who


---------95:00----------
I am so maybe this is where I can teach


---------95:03----------
you guys a particular meditation


---------95:04----------
practice and so we'll do that in a


---------95:09----------
second but if it's okay with you guys


---------95:12----------
I'd like to just try to summarize a


---------95:13----------
little bit about what I heard today is


---------95:16----------
that okay so I just need a second which


---------95:25----------
now I wonder whether that's going to be


---------95:27----------
like an emo that is racist towards


---------95:30----------
Indian people that's what I learned


---------95:37----------
today thank you guys very much we'll see


---------95:38----------
you all next so let me just think about


---------95:44----------
this all right so like i'ma start with


---------95:50----------
all right this may not make a whole lot


---------95:52----------
of sense because I'm just looking at


---------95:53----------
random things that I jotted down so I'm


---------95:56----------
gonna start with it shouldn't be this


---------95:57----------
way like that's where it starts right


---------96:03----------
that you guys were each thrust into life


---------96:05----------
with various amounts of debuffs and on


---------96:08----------
hardmode and it just it just shouldn't


---------96:11----------
be this way that greed and and you know


---------96:17----------
like like that you guys were so I I


---------96:20----------
don't know that you guys were really


---------96:21----------
allowed I mean it's almost like you guys


---------96:24----------
you know roll the stats of a fighter and


---------96:26----------
you were given like a wizard staff and a


---------96:28----------
set of robes and then you were like when


---------96:31----------
told to live life and this is where like


---------96:32----------
identity and exercise right and and so


---------96:39----------
it's kind of hard cuz you guys are like


---------96:41----------
sitting there on like level one you're


---------96:43----------
like what the [ __ ] is the stick like you


---------96:48----------
know so this kind of goes back to the


---------96:50----------
idea of like you know playing the game


---------96:51----------
with a wiimote instead of a regular


---------96:53----------
controller and being called smarten but


---------96:55----------
lazy because it's like everyone's you


---------96:57----------
know you're running around with the


---------96:58----------
stick and you're you know me laying


---------97:00----------
people with it when the stick is


---------97:02----------
designed to have spells and you're just


---------97:03----------
you're a different character like you


---------97:04----------
were born to use a sword and and so I I


---------97:09----------
think that there's a lot of there's a


---------97:11----------
lot of like expectation that was thrust


---------97:13----------
upon you guys everything from religious


---------97:15----------
expectations around what mental health


---------97:17----------
is to really kind of invalidating and I


---------97:20----------
don't really like that word but like


---------97:21----------
really just you guys being not allowed


---------97:24----------
to be the person that you are and what


---------97:27----------
I'm hearing from many of you guys is


---------97:28----------
that you guys had to fight for each inch


---------97:31----------
of ground like I'm thinking like I'm


---------97:33----------
imagining y'all's lives as like World


---------97:35----------
War two trench warfare where it's like


---------97:37----------
every foot that you gain is like gain


---------97:42----------
with like blood and sweat yes you know


---------97:46----------
and and it sounds like Eli's mom is


---------97:48----------
super supportive but it doesn't sound


---------97:50----------
like she started that way you know that


---------97:52----------
was like like you guys have to carve out


---------97:54----------
your space in the world and whether


---------97:58----------
that's holding back the way that you


---------98:00----------
talk around your peers because they


---------98:02----------
literally wouldn't understand you or


---------98:04----------
trying to tell your dad like what you


---------98:06----------
want to do in life and like he tells you


---------98:09----------
that you'd become a waste of everything


---------98:10----------
that all of his sweat and toil if you


---------98:13----------
choose to be the person that you are


---------98:14----------
what the [ __ ] man all right


---------98:18----------
or for for people in your life who have


---------98:22----------
been very very lazy in terms of their


---------98:24----------
invalidation of you the lazy ones just


---------98:27----------
called you smart but lazy right they


---------98:31----------
didn't even bathe in eve it like take


---------98:33----------
the time of data to invalidate you as a


---------98:36----------
person and a very specific in thoughtful


---------98:39----------
way hitter just like you're so [ __ ]


---------98:42----------
lazy why can't you just be better just


---------98:44----------
be better in life


---------98:46----------
Akeem would stop just sucking just be


---------98:49----------
better bro right and so then I kind of


---------98:54----------
get to this like you know I think we


---------98:55----------
kind of get into this idea of like


---------98:56----------
building your identity and the


---------98:58----------
expectations that people put on you


---------99:00----------
whether it's playing a game and like not


---------99:01----------
being able to use voice chat or you know


---------99:05----------
I've been having this question by mine


---------99:06----------
like I don't even know can pee I mean I


---------99:08----------
assume people can tell that you're black


---------99:10----------
based on your voice over voice chat yes


---------99:15----------
your cadence is about the cadence of


---------99:17----------
luigi last week and that's part of a


---------99:19----------
caricature as well and you already


---------99:20----------
understood like if you understand that


---------99:22----------
men when you bring the caricature has


---------99:25----------
been perpetuated for such a long time


---------99:26----------
they will immediately sign the cadence


---------99:29----------
in which you speak from that caricature


---------99:30----------
to you yeah so I like you know it comes


---------99:34----------
back to the sense of like you know be


---------99:36----------
like not being able to be yourself in


---------99:38----------
the world which you know starts with


---------99:39----------
your parents and even like even like


---------99:41----------
manifests in the gaming community and so


---------99:44----------
then I get the sense of you know I think


---------99:46----------
we see a couple of things that come up


---------99:48----------
the first is exhaustion that you guys


---------99:52----------
just have to do [ __ ] that like other


---------99:54----------
people don't have to do or maybe other


---------99:56----------
people do have to do it maybe that's


---------99:58----------
unfair to other people but I'm just


---------100:00----------
getting a layer of additional effort


---------100:02----------
like let's forget about other people but


---------100:03----------
that you have to do right that like I


---------100:05----------
you know when I log on to discord I


---------100:07----------
really don't think about you know what


---------100:09----------
how I sound and I don't have to spend


---------100:12----------
time thinking about that


---------100:14----------
and you know when I the only time I


---------100:16----------
spend thinking about is when I'm having


---------100:18----------
fun like when I saw top I'm talking like


---------100:19----------
takes and you know we can do that and


---------100:21----------
who the so you can you can play a game


---------100:24----------
of doubters for long new agents y'all


---------100:27----------
play legal agents leaders great ending


---------100:32----------
and so like that's been my experience of


---------100:37----------
my voice and it's been an overwhelmingly


---------100:39----------
positive thing and so I'm hearing you


---------100:42----------
guys just really so there's like this


---------100:43----------
idea of like who you are and who the


---------100:45----------
world wants you to be and and walking


---------100:48----------
that tightrope is just exhausting mm-hmm


---------100:51----------
and and at the worst it's like painful


---------100:54----------
and and really like I I'm really glad


---------100:57----------
that Moe took the time to dig in and and


---------100:59----------
think about what validating means


---------101:02----------
because it's not validating it's like he


---------101:04----------
used the word justified yeah what


---------101:07----------
justified what justified his [ __ ]


---------101:09----------
existence is a person and who he is and


---------101:12----------
not to be labeled or like you guys were


---------101:16----------
like yeah man you deserve to like be on


---------101:18----------
this earth and we're okay with the


---------101:19----------
person that you are that's what that was


---------101:21----------
it's not validation that's justification


---------101:24----------
of existence which what I hear from you


---------101:27----------
guys is not something that you'll get on


---------101:29----------
a daily basis and and this also I think


---------101:31----------
does race have a piece of why you're


---------101:33----------
absolutely I think you guys really you


---------101:35----------
know drew the short end of the steak in


---------101:37----------
the world that we live in today and at


---------101:40----------
the same time I think that's also


---------101:41----------
something that is not unique to black


---------101:43----------
people right I mean I think that smart


---------101:46----------
but lazy people who don't deserve to be


---------101:48----------
alive is like pretty much describes our


---------101:51----------
community and that's who we are


---------101:52----------
and and that's tough it's like it's


---------101:56----------
[ __ ] exhausting and so then I think


---------101:59----------
now we get into the part that I think is


---------102:01----------
really really tricky which is like you


---------102:04----------
know this idea that you're a lazy lazy


---------102:05----------
piece of [ __ ] and that you have to prove


---------102:07----------
it and I'd be careful because there's a


---------102:10----------
part of me that really like that rubs me


---------102:11----------
the wrong way when you guys try to like


---------102:13----------
prove it or unquote I don't even know


---------102:15----------
what I mean by that but that's what I


---------102:16----------
feel because I think what you're trying


---------102:18----------
to prove is not the person that you are


---------102:20----------
but the person that people want you to


---------102:22----------
be want you to be mm-hmm and I think you


---------102:25----------
guys got to be really careful about


---------102:27----------
that right if it's the person that you


---------102:30----------
want to be fine but if it's if it's like


---------102:33----------
proving to yourself that you can be that


---------102:36----------
which people expect you to be you got to


---------102:38----------
be careful and I'm basically talking


---------102:40----------
mostly to pequin here but also all of


---------102:42----------
you guys felt like you know that's who


---------102:43----------
I'm kind of thinking about I think his


---------102:45----------
statements really made me kind of think


---------102:47----------
about that I think we all face that too


---------102:49----------
and so then the question becomes how do


---------102:51----------
you figure out like who you are and it's


---------102:54----------
absolutely an individual journey and I


---------102:56----------
think the main thing that I'm hearing is


---------102:58----------
that the main different the main common


---------103:00----------
thread between and I'm just gonna kind


---------103:02----------
of reference Eli Raymond and Moe because


---------103:04----------
I think that's where I heard heard it is


---------103:06----------
they paid attention to their experiences


---------103:11----------
and they paid attention to their


---------103:13----------
experiences with their own eyes and with


---------103:15----------
their own ears and their with their own


---------103:16----------
feelings instead of interpreting their


---------103:19----------
experiences through the lens of stigma


---------103:23----------
society and expectation and it's I hear


---------103:27----------
the [ __ ] in it it still boggles my mind


---------103:29----------
every time I hear it but like get


---------103:31----------
getting diagnosed as mentally ill is


---------103:34----------
like a positive thing but Raymond felt


---------103:36----------
it was liberating and like you know Moe


---------103:39----------
getting like this diagnosis felt like he


---------103:42----------
started the process of understanding who


---------103:43----------
he is which doesn't mean that mental


---------103:45----------
illness is like a good thing I just it's


---------103:47----------
weird and I don't really know how to


---------103:48----------
make sense of it but I do think I mean


---------103:51----------
I've talked to when I used to do consult


---------103:53----------
psychiatry so this is like a


---------103:54----------
psychiatrist who works in a hospital


---------103:56----------
like in a medical hospital and I like


---------103:58----------
worked on the oncology floor and people


---------103:59----------
would say this weird [ __ ] like cancer is


---------104:01----------
the best thing that ever happened to me


---------104:02----------
I'm like dude what are you seeing like


---------104:04----------
how can that possibly be and I think


---------104:08----------
like you know in a game or analogy


---------104:10----------
there's like there's XP to be gained


---------104:11----------
there right and it's really about


---------104:13----------
learning and paying attention and like


---------104:15----------
thinking through your own journey and


---------104:18----------
and then at the end of the day I think


---------104:20----------
though that that identity and now we


---------104:22----------
come to our meditation exercise identity


---------104:24----------
can be found I do believe that that


---------104:26----------
there's an individual journey but there


---------104:28----------
are also some practices that you can get


---------104:30----------
a sense of like who your truest form of


---------104:32----------
identity is because the the people in


---------104:35----------
the East sort of had this clear idea


---------104:37----------
that like our identity is something very


---------104:39----------
pure the


---------104:40----------
the word divine and and that at the core


---------104:43----------
of our being like if you slough off all


---------104:46----------
of the expectations in all of the


---------104:49----------
[ __ ] what you see is what people saw


---------104:52----------
in MO and what mo felt which is


---------104:55----------
something like pure and beautiful and


---------104:57----------
divine and it doesn't matter what the


---------104:59----------
color of your skin is it doesn't matter


---------105:01----------
what diagnosis you have it doesn't


---------105:03----------
matter what you wear it doesn't matter


---------105:05----------
how you sound but there's just something


---------105:07----------
incredibly like pure and perfect


---------105:08----------
underneath all of it I believe that and


---------105:13----------
so then the question becomes how do we


---------105:14----------
find that well now I'm going to teach


---------105:16----------
you guys a particular meditation


---------105:17----------
technique okay so this is taught before


---------105:26----------
but I think you know I'm I sometimes we


---------105:28----------
teach things so I don't know if you guys


---------105:30----------
have encountered this but I want you all


---------105:32----------
to sit up straight I want you to close


---------105:38----------
your eyes so I'd also encourage you guys


---------105:41----------
to adopt Pyatt of a mudra which is this


---------105:46----------
so right hand and left you can put your


---------105:49----------
thumbs together and then go ahead and


---------105:53----------
put it in your lap so your arms are kind


---------105:55----------
of like a loose circle and then close


---------106:00----------
your eyes and just feel the person that


---------106:04----------
you are for a second just notice


---------106:07----------
yourself right so notice your body maybe


---------106:14----------
a particular facial expression maybe a


---------106:19----------
crinkling of the eyebrows a slight smile


---------106:21----------
maybe a little bit more of a bigger


---------106:24----------
smile


---------106:27----------
just notice who you are and this is


---------106:34----------
gonna sound kind of weird but like where


---------106:37----------
do you feel yourself you know where is


---------106:41----------
that Yunis like where do you exist maybe


---------106:47----------
kind of a weird question it doesn't make


---------106:48----------
sense not a big deal if it does you may


---------106:51----------
also notice your thoughts so take a


---------106:57----------
moment to notice that weird-ass thing


---------106:59----------
that we call the mind you saw the random


---------107:02----------
thoughts that it generates and sometimes


---------107:05----------
how you feel like those thoughts become


---------107:07----------
truth and that the thoughts can be


---------107:10----------
devastating and at a time those thoughts


---------107:14----------
become you or you become thoughts you


---------107:18----------
merge with them I'm a bad person I'm a


---------107:24----------
stupid person you know there I'm a waste


---------107:28----------
of space I'm a lazy piece of [ __ ] and


---------107:31----------
now I want you guys to look for a second


---------107:34----------
what D can you find the lazy piece of


---------107:36----------
[ __ ] within you but in this moment can


---------107:41----------
you find the part of yourself that is a


---------107:43----------
lazy piece of [ __ ]


---------107:53----------
look for it where is it what is it what


---------107:55----------
does it look like what does it feel like


---------107:56----------
can anybody find it I'm gonna ask you


---------107:58----------
guys to speak okay so so it sounds like


---------108:04----------
Eli can some people can't I can what


---------108:08----------
about you maybe a little maybe a little


---------108:12----------
it'll take it right so Eli can you tell


---------108:14----------
us what the lazy piece of [ __ ] feels


---------108:16----------
like to you the first thing that came to


---------108:19----------
mind the first thing that came to mind


---------108:21----------
was the child so I have this thing in my


---------108:23----------
head constantly since I've been the kid


---------108:25----------
was I feel like the kid that I was the


---------108:28----------
only thing that I really need was a hug


---------108:29----------
and in my mind the person that came to


---------108:30----------
mind was the kid that was scared of the


---------108:33----------
world and I was crying and I think that


---------108:35----------
is that part of myself okay great thanks


---------108:38----------
for sure so now what I want you guys to


---------108:41----------
do is keep go back to eyes closed so


---------108:44----------
feel that circuit between your arms and


---------108:48----------
kind of the linking notice your breath


---------108:55----------
and I want you to notice the inhalation


---------108:58----------
and the exhalation preferably through


---------109:01----------
the nose


---------109:02----------
but exhalation through the mouth is okay


---------109:04----------
if you really feel like it and now


---------109:18----------
without holding your breath I want you


---------109:21----------
to zero in on the moment where


---------109:24----------
inhalation becomes exhalation


---------109:37----------
notice that there's a discreet


---------109:39----------
inhalation in a discreet exhalation and


---------109:43----------
then there's something in-between I'm


---------109:53----------
gonna give you guys a few seconds to


---------109:55----------
just breathe and notice and now as you


---------110:20----------
find that space between inhalation and


---------110:22----------
exhalation put yourself fully into it


---------110:26----------
and then in that space try to notice who


---------110:34----------
you are who exists in the space between


---------110:53----------
inhalation and exhalation we'll practice


---------111:02----------
for about 30 seconds 60 let's give it a


---------111:06----------
minute


---------112:27----------
now let your awareness slowly return to


---------112:33----------
January 8th 2020 let your name return to


---------112:41----------
you let your location return to you


---------112:45----------
you're ready slowly open your eyes would


---------113:03----------
anyone like to share some reflections or


---------113:06----------
their experience of the practice yeah I


---------113:10----------
felt really chill I guess the point


---------113:14----------
where you were asked in the moment


---------113:17----------
between the inhale and exhale it was


---------113:18----------
like a parabola and it was at like a


---------113:20----------
range between sometimes it was closer to


---------113:23----------
the in hill sometimes quistis about um


---------113:25----------
exhale and also when you um asked me who


---------113:32----------
was that person at that moment in time


---------113:33----------
it was just a guy breathing it wasn't


---------113:35----------
myself it wasn't Raymond it wasn't space


---------113:38----------
and it wasn't was just a guy breathing


---------113:41----------
thus I saw it forward liked it thanks


---------113:46----------
that's okay people sort of had a similar


---------113:52----------
experience different experience having


---------113:58----------
um I was meditating recently especially


---------114:01----------
I've been after I started feeling better


---------114:03----------
way before all the black lives matter


---------114:06----------
protests have been gone recently I have


---------114:10----------
this is this associated feeling from the


---------114:12----------
madness of the world being able to


---------114:13----------
recognize that my being above and


---------114:15----------
outside of that and I feel that again


---------114:17----------
very strongly right now especially after


---------114:19----------
this entire stream I didn't recognize


---------114:21----------
how much better I would feel after


---------114:22----------
talking about all these things and I


---------114:24----------
guess getting them out of my head


---------114:26----------
without realizing how much of a problem


---------114:28----------
for me well such a long time and I feel


---------114:31----------
a lot peace in this moment I I feel


---------114:41----------
anxiety and that in between in that


---------114:45----------
moment in between an inhale on an exhale


---------114:46----------
I feel scared I feel I just I don't know


---------114:53----------
it's I don't know if I like that


---------114:55----------
in-between moment I like the inhaling of


---------114:57----------
the exhaling because it's there it's


---------114:59----------
like curry and it's like constant but I


---------115:03----------
it's it's that pausing that moment


---------115:05----------
between that scares me I think that's


---------115:10----------
completely fair man it is it can be a


---------115:13----------
very scary place to be for some people


---------115:16----------
doesn't mean you're doing it wrong


---------115:18----------
doesn't necessarily mean you need to


---------115:20----------
continue doing that practice but thanks


---------115:23----------
for sharing hard to explain like like


---------115:35----------
the shift like like a transmission oh


---------115:38----------
yeah yeah go for it you we can hear you


---------115:41----------
now maybe you speak up up eat it again


---------115:47----------
it's kind of party maybe bring the phone


---------115:55----------
closer to you yeah I can I could pick it


---------116:02----------
out is that better yeah okay all right


---------116:09----------
so for me I kind of saw like the shift


---------116:11----------
like and like shifting gears and unlike


---------116:14----------
the breath like returning and exhaling


---------116:17----------
and it just like it I was able to like


---------116:21----------
just reflect on myself a lot and how I


---------116:23----------
view myself which it was a really


---------116:26----------
positive experience because I think I've


---------116:30----------
gotten a lot better like a more happy


---------116:32----------
person I feel better about myself


---------116:34----------
and so is kind of just helping like


---------116:36----------
reinforce that fact and I really enjoyed


---------116:38----------
it so thank you


---------116:42----------
a keen you don't have to speak but you


---------116:44----------
know you're it's kind of weird I mean I


---------116:46----------
don't want you to feel pressure to speak


---------116:48----------
if you don't do I guess at that moment


---------116:58----------
of like between inhale and exhale and


---------117:05----------
like you asking what do you feel about


---------117:10----------
yourself or like who do you feel you are


---------117:13----------
at that moment and I guess the only


---------117:15----------
image that came to my mind was just like


---------117:17----------
a very I don't know just I guess I just


---------117:21----------
felt like very grand and like powerful


---------117:24----------
and I don't know if that's like I mean


---------117:28----------
that's kind of the thing that I always


---------117:29----------
wonder about in terms of identity like


---------117:34----------
I'd persistently have that perception of


---------117:37----------
myself but then I also feel like that is


---------117:40----------
also comes a lot from what people have


---------117:44----------
generally always expected from me so I'm


---------117:47----------
always like is that actually how I feel


---------117:49----------
about myself or is that just like me


---------117:51----------
trying to fit a role so I just always go


---------117:53----------
back into that question in my mind but I


---------117:56----------
don't know yeah so I Kenai I think you


---------118:01----------
have a lot of teasing apart to do right


---------118:04----------
so the way that I would interpret what


---------118:08----------
you said and we can go through and kind


---------118:09----------
of interpret everyone's different


---------118:11----------
responses but let's start with you and


---------118:13----------
go in reverse order so your case I think


---------118:16----------
that you've always had a sense of for


---------118:19----------
lack of better terms your divinity the


---------118:22----------
problem is that your the expectations


---------118:25----------
that people place upon you in the


---------118:27----------
expectations that you place upon


---------118:28----------
yourself turn that pure divinity into


---------118:33----------
grandmas they hijack it like because


---------118:37----------
here's the thing is they've expected


---------118:39----------
great things from you and you felt


---------118:41----------
greatness within you and so you've just


---------118:43----------
lumped those two things together where


---------118:45----------
they actually need to be completely


---------118:47----------
separate and it's it's gonna be a hard


---------118:50----------
road but like it really involves teasing


---------118:53----------
apart that which you feel about yourself


---------118:55----------
from that which you expect yourself to


---------118:58----------
be but I'd encourage you to keep doing


---------119:03----------
it I think before that was Julian yeah


---------119:07----------
and Julian you had said what me good


---------119:12----------
yeah so it was just like um it was a


---------119:15----------
moment for me to like be like very


---------119:17----------
insightful about like how I view myself


---------119:19----------
and um re-emphasize like how do I say


---------119:25----------
this kind of cosign those like in my own


---------119:31----------
mind like so I thought like generally


---------119:34----------
like nice things about myself and like


---------119:35----------
what I know from like what people have


---------119:37----------
told me and everything um and I was


---------119:39----------
kinda just like reaffirming those


---------119:40----------
feelings just while I was just thinking


---------119:43----------
and just trying to like I could feel


---------119:46----------
like just happier and I could feel like


---------119:48----------
that like more complete yeah good so I


---------119:50----------
think just let yourself continue to like


---------119:53----------
drink the water from that well right and


---------119:57----------
and like as people have other


---------119:59----------
expectations and you have thoughts about


---------120:01----------
yourself and like whether it's positive


---------120:02----------
or negative just like don't let go that


---------120:05----------
source you know and let it just continue


---------120:08----------
to fir like you know water your fields


---------120:09----------
and like whatever other nature analogy


---------120:11----------
you want mow in your case I think it's


---------120:17----------
completely fine for you to feel anxious


---------120:19----------
so sometimes raw experiences of self can


---------120:24----------
be incredibly anxiety provoking and


---------120:26----------
untethering I'm not sure that you had a


---------120:28----------
raw experience of self but that


---------120:29----------
absolutely happens so I think in your


---------120:32----------
case you may just want to have a


---------120:33----------
practice that really anchors you to the


---------120:35----------
present and anchors like is like so this


---------120:38----------
is a more abstract or untethering


---------120:40----------
practice it's actually designed to like


---------120:42----------
tech like and remove yourself from all


---------120:45----------
of the things that you think you are and


---------120:48----------
just find kind of a pure part of you and


---------120:50----------
I think the interesting thing mo is that


---------120:53----------
I think a lot of your growth has been in


---------120:56----------
finding anchors with your life and I


---------121:00----------
don't think that you're ready to let go


---------121:01----------
those yet which I don't think you should


---------121:03----------
because they're good anchors for you so


---------121:05----------
if you need to stick with the inhalation


---------121:07----------
and exhalation by all means stick with


---------121:09----------
inhalation exhalation keep going keep


---------121:11----------
walking the road that you're on because


---------121:12----------
it feels to me like it's on you know the


---------121:14----------
right direction you can absolutely have


---------121:16----------
kids one day you know it's like I mean I


---------121:19----------
know a lot of people who have bipolar


---------121:21----------
disorder and have children some of their


---------121:24----------
kids struggle too but like they're


---------121:26----------
they're happy stories like I'm thinking


---------121:28----------
about one person in particular who kid


---------121:31----------
had a lot of problems they had a lot of


---------121:32----------
problems they're both doing fantastic


---------121:34----------
now and now they have grandkids we're


---------121:38----------
doing great that's beautiful thank you


---------121:40----------
doctor it's like it absolutely happens


---------121:41----------
man


---------121:43----------
you know Eli I think I think it's


---------121:46----------
amazing that you've done I you know when


---------121:48----------
I heard you kind of talk about that


---------121:50----------
child within yourself i think it's clear


---------121:52----------
to me that you've done a lot of growth


---------121:54----------
and you've done a lot of exploration and


---------121:56----------
that you can sort of feel the some scar


---------121:59----------
for a lack of a better term of like you


---------122:02----------
know the piece of [ __ ] within you and


---------122:04----------
and to recognize that like that piece of


---------122:07----------
[ __ ] is not who you are but is a piece


---------122:10----------
of you that needs you to take care of it


---------122:13----------
and i think it's sort of a line with


---------122:15----------
what you're saying earlier about like


---------122:16----------
teaching yourself to be like the father


---------122:18----------
that you needed interestingly enough my


---------122:21----------
my teacher taught me a very specific


---------122:23----------
practice to do that which was sort of


---------122:25----------
like the cert my teacher gave me this


---------122:28----------
practice for the search for inner guru


---------122:30----------
so to like find a teacher within you so


---------122:34----------
that you need no external teachers so i


---------122:38----------
think you should just do whatever


---------122:38----------
whatever [ __ ] you're doing and you've


---------122:40----------
been doing just keep at it bro so I


---------122:43----------
think in sounds like it's a it's a good


---------122:48----------
journey and then Raymond I think you


---------122:52----------
know when I teach this practice and be


---------122:55----------
careful because this is gonna be loaded


---------122:58----------
what I hope what I imagine people will


---------123:01----------
experience or what I hope people would


---------123:02----------
experience is actually the closest to


---------123:04----------
what you described like this sense of


---------123:06----------
the parabola and the up and down doesn't


---------123:08----------
mean that it's right that's not the


---------123:09----------
point of meditation but I all of the


---------123:12----------
people in this group I would encourage


---------123:14----------
you to continue doing this practice the


---------123:16----------
most because I think that just something


---------123:19----------
about the way that you described it is


---------123:22----------
yeah maybe I mean you got all y'all can


---------123:26----------
do it everyone except for Moe but you


---------123:28----------
know III think that in terms of just the


---------123:31----------
way that you described it I think it's


---------123:32----------
the closest description to what I think


---------123:36----------
you will gain more from and it's not to


---------123:38----------
say that other people can't do it or


---------123:40----------
won't gain a lot and you definitely


---------123:41----------
don't want to make a decision after like


---------123:42----------
you know three minutes of a meditation


---------123:44----------
practice right so but but I think just


---------123:47----------
the way that you lost yourself in the


---------123:49----------
parabola is something that let me put it


---------123:51----------
this way other people who I have taught


---------123:54----------
this practice who have described


---------123:55----------
something similar have gone on to gain a


---------123:57----------
lot from it that's the way I should


---------123:59----------
describe it says nothing about the rest


---------124:01----------
of you guys it just means yet I've heard


---------124:03----------
other people describe that and then


---------124:05----------
they've they've gotten a lot out of


---------124:06----------
continued practice


---------124:09----------
so overall guys thank you so much for


---------124:12----------
coming on and and you know sharing


---------124:14----------
y'all's perspectives I it's it's been


---------124:19----------
amazing to hear your story and also like


---------124:21----------
sad to be honest to hear what you guys


---------124:23----------
have had to deal with and yeah just


---------124:28----------
tired


---------124:28----------
tiring more than anything else and I'm


---------124:31----------
glad that you all are part of the


---------124:33----------
community in like I think it's been


---------124:35----------
amazing to listen to you guys and I'm


---------124:37----------
grateful that you all have decided to


---------124:39----------
come on here today and try to share a


---------124:41----------
little bit about yourselves and help


---------124:42----------
help us out


---------124:46----------
thank you that's okay as well


---------124:49----------
what's for having us thank you so much


---------124:51----------
rather than you really appreciate it and


---------124:55----------
good luck to you as well but I'm gonna


---------124:59----------
keep thank you


---------125:05----------
okay alright so that was fun helpful I


---------125:16----------
hope that was helpful to you guys as


---------125:17----------
well yeah man it's tough dude it's tough


---------125:21----------
life ain't easy it's hard game hard game


---------125:26----------
to play


---------125:28----------
really hard for some people


---------125:37----------
yeah I think it's been tough but you


---------125:43----------
know those guys are strong and I I felt


---------125:47----------
yeah


---------125:48----------
I just have to process for a second


---------125:56----------
it surprises me how


---------126:02----------
it surprises me like how individual art


---------126:05----------
journeys can be and how common our


---------126:10----------
problems and struggles are like we can


---------126:13----------
all share the same challenges and


---------126:15----------
there's a lot to be gained from each


---------126:16----------
other and at the same time it's so


---------126:17----------
interesting to see like how you know


---------126:19----------
different people's growth and progress


---------126:21----------
is so wildly you know how it's supposed


---------126:27----------
to blur and that everyone's journey is


---------126:30----------
so unique and I think it's really cool


---------126:32----------
when like you know I guess I'm just sort


---------126:34----------
of envisioning a couple years ago I went


---------126:37----------
to climb Mount Kilimanjaro and it was


---------126:41----------
cool because like you know you you meet


---------126:42----------
certain people and then you hike with


---------126:44----------
them for a while and you're on the same


---------126:46----------
Road side by side for like two days and


---------126:50----------
then you know they decide to leave early


---------126:52----------
the next morning and then you're kind of


---------126:53----------
like by yourself again and both of you


---------126:55----------
guys are on your own journey and you can


---------126:57----------
really share it and resonate with


---------126:59----------
someone and really be with someone for


---------127:01----------
some time and then you have to go off on


---------127:03----------
your own path and and just hearing those


---------127:07----------
guys that's kind of what I felt like it


---------127:09----------
just reminded me of Kilimanjaro and like


---------127:10----------
that each of these people are walking


---------127:12----------
their own path but like sometimes you


---------127:14----------
know the steps look really similar and I


---------127:17----------
hope that you guys learned something or


---------127:19----------
gained something from hearing about


---------127:20----------
their path and maybe you can you know


---------127:23----------
walk yours a little bit better or even


---------127:25----------
just keep walking


---------127:26----------
after hearing theirs and it's it's cool


---------127:31----------
I'm glad that you know they came on and


---------127:33----------
I'm glad that you guys show up to listen


---------127:35----------
and


---------127:39----------
yeah
