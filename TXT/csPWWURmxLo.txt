a couple months ago

on the topic


---------01:06----------
a little bit yeah um so i'm excited to


---------01:10----------
get a chance to kind of talk to you more


---------01:12----------
is there something in particular you


---------01:14----------
wanted to talk about today


---------01:17----------
yeah um i was


---------01:21----------
in the gifted and talented education


---------01:23----------
program


---------01:24----------
very early on i think they um the


---------01:27----------
official test began in the third grade


---------01:30----------
and i noticed actually pretty quickly


---------01:32----------
that my interest in school


---------01:34----------
declined a lot in about


---------01:38----------
fifth grade so it wasn't long after


---------01:41----------
and the only actual passion that i had


---------01:44----------
was


---------01:44----------
the gifted and talented program after


---------01:47----------
school


---------01:48----------
but all meanwhile during school it was


---------01:50----------
like


---------01:51----------
it was just a real struggle for me to


---------01:54----------
stay


---------01:54----------
interested okay and then um it only got


---------01:58----------
worse about sixth to eighth grade


---------02:00----------
i actually didn't technically graduate


---------02:02----------
middle school


---------02:03----------
but i did progress on to the ninth grade


---------02:06----------
um


---------02:06----------
i wasn't held back and then i dropped


---------02:10----------
out of school


---------02:11----------
officially in the 11th grade like i


---------02:14----------
think we were two weeks into the


---------02:16----------
semester


---------02:17----------
and i just told my parents like look


---------02:19----------
it's not looking good and they're like


---------02:21----------
okay um and just to give you some more


---------02:24----------
information um my brother also dropped


---------02:27----------
out of high school


---------02:28----------
and he's older than me and so my parents


---------02:31----------
were like okay like we're not going to


---------02:33----------
let the same path happened twice you


---------02:37----------
know like


---------02:38----------
we need to find new options and and they


---------02:40----------
knew how gifted and bright that i really


---------02:42----------
was


---------02:42----------
so they really you know struggled with


---------02:45----------
the idea of me dropping out they were


---------02:47----------
like we just don't get it you're


---------02:48----------
you're just lazy like what's going on


---------02:51----------
something's wrong


---------02:52----------
so um i ended up going to continuation


---------02:56----------
school from there


---------02:58----------
which is more of like in if there's a


---------03:00----------
teacher there


---------03:01----------
and you go for about four hours a day


---------03:04----------
and


---------03:05----------
they kind of guide you like okay here


---------03:06----------
are your packets for the week when you


---------03:08----------
come back


---------03:09----------
you'll get half a credit blah blah blah


---------03:12----------
and then that ended up not working for


---------03:14----------
me either


---------03:15----------
so i dropped out of that and i actually


---------03:19----------
went to adult school at the age of 17


---------03:24----------
and there they had a program for


---------03:26----------
non-adults


---------03:27----------
to achieve a ged when they turned 18. um


---------03:32----------
and in that class i finally met um


---------03:35----------
you know a teacher that recognized


---------03:39----------
what my struggle really was and and he


---------03:42----------
was like


---------03:42----------
man you really don't need this class


---------03:45----------
he's like you're just not old enough to


---------03:47----------
take the test


---------03:48----------
so what he had me do was tutor kids


---------03:50----------
one-on-one in the back of the class that


---------03:52----------
were about to take their tests soon


---------03:54----------
and i would prepare them and get them


---------03:56----------
ready for their tests and


---------03:57----------
answer any questions that they had while


---------03:59----------
he was teaching everyone else


---------04:01----------
and i loved it and i think if it wasn't


---------04:05----------
for that class i wouldn't have gone to


---------04:07----------
college which my only option at the time


---------04:09----------
was community college


---------04:11----------
and i went over there and i excelled and


---------04:13----------
i loved it and


---------04:14----------
i embraced college a lot and um


---------04:18----------
i ended up dropping out though to come


---------04:21----------
back to streaming


---------04:22----------
because at the time i was like this is


---------04:24----------
what i really want it's here


---------04:25----------
i'm not gonna miss it but that was also


---------04:27----------
a struggle for me because


---------04:29----------
it really made me feel like man am i


---------04:31----------
really dropping out


---------04:33----------
because i'm afraid of school or am i


---------04:36----------
dropping out


---------04:36----------
because of streaming you know like it


---------04:38----------
was it was a real battle because i had


---------04:40----------
dropped out of school so many times


---------04:42----------
um but i ended up just going for it and


---------04:45----------
not letting that hold me back and i'm


---------04:47----------
really happy that i did


---------04:48----------
and i actually still plan on possibly


---------04:51----------
going back


---------04:52----------
at least for a few classes even if it's


---------04:54----------
just


---------04:55----------
you know learning new hobbies new


---------04:56----------
techniques um


---------04:58----------
i'm really into education and and i do


---------05:00----------
like um


---------05:02----------
you know teaching myself new things and


---------05:05----------
and being taught


---------05:06----------
by a teacher i love being taught i think


---------05:08----------
it's great


---------05:10----------
i've got a sneeze coming perfect wow


---------05:13----------
that was such a


---------05:14----------
great um narrative adapt i i thought it


---------05:17----------
was


---------05:18----------
um and so how are you feeling nowadays


---------05:23----------
um i i mean


---------05:26----------
like that's a hard question for me


---------05:27----------
because i haven't been in school for so


---------05:29----------
long


---------05:30----------
so i don't know if you mean like


---------05:32----------
school-wise i'm like uh


---------05:33----------
nothing you know like i'm happy with the


---------05:36----------
choice that i made is


---------05:37----------
what i guess i could say there um i feel


---------05:40----------
very


---------05:41----------
grateful every day to just be alive and


---------05:44----------
um i feel grateful that i have this


---------05:48----------
job that i have and and that i have


---------05:52----------
a home to do my job in and and that's


---------05:55----------
you know


---------05:55----------
my family's good i'm good health for now


---------05:58----------
so it's a lot to be grateful for


---------06:01----------
yeah okay that's uh


---------06:04----------
so it sounds like you're pretty grateful


---------06:08----------
and and you really appreciate the


---------06:10----------
opportunities you've been given


---------06:12----------
you're grateful for some of the choices


---------06:13----------
you made you know choosing to be a


---------06:15----------
little bit of a misfit to society when


---------06:17----------
it was the right time to do so


---------06:20----------
yeah i think that's really common for us


---------06:22----------
on twitch


---------06:23----------
because sort of society doesn't really


---------06:25----------
work for us in some ways


---------06:27----------
um yeah is there is there anything that


---------06:30----------
you kind of want to focus on or sort of


---------06:33----------
try to learn


---------06:34----------
a little bit more about or understand a


---------06:36----------
little bit better about yourself


---------06:39----------
um honestly i wanted to just have a full


---------06:42----------
open discussion with you about


---------06:45----------
kind of that whole narrative that i


---------06:47----------
talked to you about because


---------06:49----------
you know along the way there were there


---------06:51----------
were a lot of points


---------06:53----------
where i was just very lost and confused


---------06:57----------
because i was so smart it's like so


---------07:00----------
bright and i i could pick up topics so


---------07:03----------
quickly so easily


---------07:05----------
um and i always try and use


---------07:08----------
my my stream my twitter everything


---------07:11----------
to kind of give insight for kids that


---------07:13----------
were just as lost as i am


---------07:15----------
because i i couldn't at the time


---------07:16----------
comprehend why i couldn't just


---------07:18----------
do the work like i i okay so


---------07:22----------
there was actually i mean i'm just gonna


---------07:24----------
recall even a day


---------07:25----------
in high school where there was this girl


---------07:27----------
in my class she


---------07:28----------
she just knew that i had these abilities


---------07:31----------
and i think most of the kids knew


---------07:33----------
but they just kind of assumed i was a


---------07:35----------
[ __ ] up like they didn't understand


---------07:37----------
why i wouldn't do the work either um


---------07:40----------
because i always had the answers


---------07:42----------
but i couldn't do the work i couldn't


---------07:44----------
sit there for hours and hours on


---------07:46----------
on end and just do the work


---------07:49----------
and um there was a girl in my class one


---------07:52----------
time and she goes


---------07:53----------
can you just teach me how to do all this


---------07:55----------
and i was like sure yeah i'll walk you


---------07:57----------
through the whole worksheet that's fine


---------07:59----------
and i sat there and i taught her


---------08:00----------
everything and and one thing i love to


---------08:02----------
do


---------08:03----------
especially when it comes to school and


---------08:05----------
classes


---------08:06----------
is always find a way to teach people in


---------08:09----------
a language that they understand


---------08:11----------
because a lot of the times i felt like


---------08:13----------
um you know when my when my peers


---------08:15----------
weren't getting it


---------08:16----------
it's because the teacher had only


---------08:17----------
explained it in one way and they


---------08:19----------
couldn't fully grasp it


---------08:21----------
and they didn't know how to make it


---------08:22----------
their own so that they could understand


---------08:24----------
it


---------08:24----------
so i would like sit there and walk them


---------08:26----------
through that as long as i had to until


---------08:28----------
they understood it


---------08:29----------
and then um she just looked at me and


---------08:31----------
she's like man i wish i had your brain


---------08:35----------
and that's like something that really


---------08:36----------
engraved in my head because


---------08:38----------
i i didn't want to take this brain for


---------08:40----------
granted ever


---------08:42----------
and it's it's always kind of been like a


---------08:44----------
like a motivating factor for me


---------08:47----------
to not completely what feels like


---------08:49----------
wasting my brain


---------08:51----------
because a part of me is kind of sad


---------08:54----------
that i didn't achieve great like


---------08:56----------
scholarly tasks with


---------08:58----------
with the brain that i had because i was


---------09:00----------
always


---------09:01----------
ahead of track until i was


---------09:04----------
way behind track and so that was like a


---------09:07----------
really tough battle for me internally


---------09:10----------
how did it feel when she asked you for


---------09:12----------
help do you remember


---------09:13----------
that's a beautiful story by the way


---------09:15----------
thank you um


---------09:18----------
it just felt i don't know


---------09:21----------
it was just like hey can you help me and


---------09:22----------
i was like oh yeah sure


---------09:24----------
i i really didn't get feelings about it


---------09:26----------
until she was like


---------09:27----------
i wish i had your brain because i was


---------09:29----------
like man that's true not everyone


---------09:32----------
you know can you comprehend that when


---------09:34----------
she said that


---------09:36----------
um it was just like an eye opener


---------09:39----------
um it made me feel it


---------09:42----------
like almost just questioning everything


---------09:45----------
like am i wasting it


---------09:46----------
am i doing what i should be doing what


---------09:49----------
like why


---------09:50----------
am i it it made me feel good and bad it


---------09:53----------
was very bittersweet


---------09:54----------
good and bad at the same time i can


---------09:57----------
imagine


---------09:58----------
um so i'm noticing that there's a lot of


---------10:01----------
bittersweetness through sort of your


---------10:03----------
story right


---------10:04----------
like yeah um being gifted i mean you


---------10:06----------
sound to me like


---------10:08----------
you know when you're one of these


---------10:09----------
characters that like during character


---------10:11----------
creation


---------10:12----------
picks up like a negative talent for


---------10:14----------
extra points


---------10:15----------
and then picks up a positive talent so


---------10:17----------
you're kind of mid-maxed


---------10:19----------
i don't know if that sort of makes sense


---------10:20----------
but you're kind of blessed and cursed


---------10:22----------
yeah at the same time yeah it's always


---------10:25----------
felt that way a bit


---------10:26----------
um and and so help i'm curious adapt


---------10:29----------
have you ever been evaluated by a


---------10:30----------
psychologist or a psychiatrist


---------10:32----------
for like learning issues or adhd or


---------10:34----------
anything like that


---------10:36----------
no um


---------10:39----------
never but i do have my first appointment


---------10:41----------
coming


---------10:42----------
so i'm really excited about that because


---------10:44----------
i do think that i i


---------10:46----------
have one of the few that you just listed


---------10:48----------
off yeah that's good so i i was just


---------10:50----------
going to say i think a lot of times when


---------10:52----------
i hear these sorts of stories


---------10:54----------
um you know there's a lot of stuff


---------10:56----------
around


---------10:57----------
specifically adhd and kids i'm curious


---------11:00----------
how big was your


---------11:01----------
uh do you do you remember how big your


---------11:03----------
class sizes were


---------11:05----------
like in the third grade fifth grade yeah


---------11:08----------
i think we had about 35 i would say as


---------11:10----------
our average


---------11:11----------
35 kids per class so that's actually a


---------11:14----------
little bit high


---------11:15----------
you know there's an interesting


---------11:16----------
correlation the larger


---------11:18----------
the class sizes the more likely children


---------11:20----------
are to be diagnosed with adhd


---------11:22----------
and it's pretty linear so like um


---------11:26----------
you know if you have like


---------11:29----------
you know 20 kids in the class and one of


---------11:32----------
them has adhd


---------11:34----------
if you have 40 kids in the class you're


---------11:36----------
actually gonna have


---------11:37----------
four kids get diagnosed with adhd so


---------11:40----------
five percent of the class will be


---------11:41----------
diagnosed


---------11:42----------
when you have 20 kids and and you know


---------11:45----------
10 will be diagnosed when you've got 40


---------11:47----------
kids


---------11:48----------
and it's kind of interesting because


---------11:50----------
what we've really found is that


---------11:52----------
um when you have a super smart kid and


---------11:55----------
you can kind of give them attention at


---------11:57----------
their own pace


---------11:59----------
they won't get diagnosed with adhd but


---------12:01----------
the more that you


---------12:02----------
ask kids to conform to like a particular


---------12:06----------
worksheet done in a particular time


---------12:08----------
the more likely people are to get


---------12:09----------
diagnosed with adhd


---------12:11----------
right you're not that yeah because that


---------12:14----------
makes me


---------12:15----------
think of um okay so to dive a little


---------12:18----------
deeper


---------12:19----------
and explain a little more um when i was


---------12:22----------
very young before i ever started going


---------12:24----------
to school


---------12:25----------
my dad sat with me and did hooked on


---------12:28----------
phonics with me


---------12:29----------
i think every single day and by the time


---------12:32----------
i went to preschool


---------12:34----------
i mean i was like the teacher's helper


---------12:36----------
because


---------12:37----------
they couldn't teach me anything they


---------12:38----------
were just there to kind of like babysit


---------12:40----------
us at that point but they were teaching


---------12:42----------
the other kids and


---------12:43----------
and i was progressed and i was very far


---------12:45----------
kindergarten same thing


---------12:47----------
um just very very progress very ahead of


---------12:51----------
pace


---------12:52----------
but then in first grade and i lived in a


---------12:54----------
different town


---------12:55----------
than where i lived most of my life


---------13:00----------
they didn't the kindergarten teacher


---------13:03----------
made notes and she


---------13:04----------
she met with other teachers the


---------13:05----------
principal whoever whatever she did


---------13:07----------
she was very caring in that sense um


---------13:10----------
to look out for me because she


---------13:12----------
recognized that i was just way ahead of


---------13:14----------
pace


---------13:15----------
and so they would have me go and do math


---------13:18----------
and literature


---------13:19----------
in the second and third grade classes


---------13:22----------
when i was in first and second grade


---------13:24----------
they'd always have they'd always make


---------13:25----------
sure that i was up in the like core


---------13:28----------
classes


---------13:29----------
and that helped me a lot because i was


---------13:33----------
like


---------13:33----------
i i felt like in school i always needed


---------13:36----------
to be learning something new


---------13:37----------
or i was just like out of it i i didn't


---------13:41----------
want to pay attention um or i would try


---------13:44----------
to and i just couldn't i would zone out


---------13:46----------
it'd be gone


---------13:47----------
um but then in the third grade


---------13:50----------
is when we moved to a new city and


---------13:53----------
here they're like oh our schools are


---------13:56----------
better than the schools that they have


---------13:57----------
in that town


---------13:58----------
so we're just going to keep her all in


---------14:00----------
these classes


---------14:02----------
and blah blah blah so the third grade


---------14:04----------
felt like i had repeated it for the


---------14:06----------
second to third time


---------14:08----------
then fourth grade felt even worse and


---------14:11----------
um it just kind of almost at that point


---------14:15----------
felt like torture


---------14:16----------
like you know when they show those


---------14:17----------
movies in the montages and the kids like


---------14:19----------
the kid starts from here then they


---------14:21----------
slowly sink down and sink down and


---------14:23----------
that's that's what elementary school and


---------14:25----------
middle school felt like to me


---------14:26----------
like it was just a montage passing by of


---------14:29----------
symbols on the board


---------14:30----------
that were the same symbols that i saw


---------14:32----------
every year


---------14:34----------
if that makes sense for you so it sounds


---------14:36----------
like you were really stagnating


---------14:38----------
yeah i i tell people this


---------14:42----------
now i say it a little less because i'm


---------14:44----------
older and i i


---------14:45----------
i don't like people's reaction to it


---------14:47----------
because they almost don't believe me


---------14:49----------
but i feel like i haven't learned that


---------14:52----------
many new things


---------14:55----------
since the second grade that teacher


---------14:58----------
that school taught me so many things


---------15:02----------
and even though you add on to those as


---------15:05----------
years go by don't get me wrong


---------15:07----------
you do add on to them you do it does


---------15:09----------
become a little more complex


---------15:12----------
but all of those core things that they


---------15:14----------
taught me


---------15:15----------
i didn't learn anything completely new


---------15:18----------
like


---------15:19----------
just to back that up i


---------15:22----------
failed every single english class


---------15:25----------
after the third grade every single


---------15:29----------
english class was a complete zero in the


---------15:31----------
book


---------15:32----------
but every single high school exam


---------15:36----------
exit exam college entrance college exit


---------15:39----------
was always placed in the highest bracket


---------15:41----------
always


---------15:42----------
but i never did an essay past the third


---------15:45----------
grade


---------15:46----------
technically unless it was a test like


---------15:47----------
that the


---------15:49----------
big state test yeah how do you


---------15:52----------
understand that


---------15:53----------
adept what do you mean


---------15:56----------
how do you understand why you weren't


---------15:58----------
able to do essays


---------15:59----------
like you like it's such a discrepancy


---------16:01----------
right having a bunch of apps on the


---------16:03----------
books


---------16:04----------
and doing really well on on all the


---------16:06----------
standardized measurements


---------16:09----------
the way that i understand it was


---------16:13----------
just i mean when i look back on it


---------16:17----------
a big thing for me was they wanted me to


---------16:19----------
sit there in class


---------16:21----------
follow along do the worksheets which i


---------16:24----------
would i mean


---------16:24----------
i'd follow along as much as i could but


---------16:27----------
then they'd also want me to go home and


---------16:29----------
spend hours at home and then do the


---------16:31----------
essays at home which is where most of


---------16:33----------
your essays had to be done


---------16:34----------
um unless they were on an exam so


---------16:39----------
i just think that i lack the discipline


---------16:43----------
if the teacher was not there making me


---------16:44----------
do the repetitive stuff


---------16:46----------
i couldn't make myself do the repetitive


---------16:48----------
stuff unless it was


---------16:50----------
like an exit exam where i wanted to do


---------16:52----------
well


---------16:53----------
because i don't want to be stuck there i


---------16:55----------
want to exit


---------16:56----------
um so that's what that was like my


---------16:59----------
driving factor like okay i need to do


---------17:01----------
this


---------17:01----------
so that i can prove that i am ready to


---------17:04----------
progress


---------17:05----------
yeah so i'm noticing a couple of themes


---------17:08----------
so let me just toss those out and then


---------17:10----------
i've got some questions for you so the


---------17:11----------
first is that


---------17:12----------
you know there's a whole lot of ahead


---------17:13----------
and behind ahead in some ways behind in


---------17:16----------
other ways


---------17:18----------
um and and i think that sort of goes to


---------17:20----------
the bitter sweetness of it right like


---------17:21----------
that there's an out like


---------17:22----------
you're clearly gifted in some angles but


---------17:24----------
you also seem to be like


---------17:26----------
um really struggling or even handicapped


---------17:29----------
when it comes to others


---------17:30----------
um where where it's sort of like and i


---------17:32----------
don't mean that in in terms of


---------17:34----------
disabilities but i mean like like you're


---------17:36----------
hamstrung right like


---------17:38----------
like there's some things like some


---------17:39----------
situations in which it seems like you


---------17:42----------
can't


---------17:43----------
leverage what your gifts are


---------17:46----------
to produce something


---------17:50----------
another thing that i'm noticing is that


---------17:52----------
you know it's interesting because it


---------17:53----------
seems like you really excel


---------17:54----------
at being individually taught


---------17:57----------
and also excel at teaching others


---------18:01----------
so as as long as you know you're


---------18:03----------
teaching


---------18:04----------
or it's kind of weird because like even


---------18:06----------
though you're failing the class it seems


---------18:08----------
like you can also tutor other kids


---------18:10----------
in the material it was always that way


---------18:12----------
yeah


---------18:13----------
and and so that you know i i just i'm


---------18:15----------
not quite sure


---------18:16----------
um where those are going to go but i


---------18:19----------
just kind of want to lay those out


---------18:21----------
i think a couple another interesting


---------18:22----------
thing is that um


---------18:24----------
you know i heard you kind of mention


---------18:26----------
this that


---------18:27----------
you know you assumed that maybe you were


---------18:29----------
a [ __ ] up maybe


---------18:30----------
um you'd wasted a lot of time you're not


---------18:32----------
sure if you wasted time you're not sure


---------18:34----------
if it was the right thing


---------18:35----------
you're kind of grateful for where things


---------18:36----------
are now at times it seems like you


---------18:39----------
really


---------18:40----------
had a lot of self-judgment or or maybe


---------18:42----------
people judged you for your performance


---------18:45----------
i'm hearing that a lot in your story and


---------18:47----------
so i was hoping to kind of ask you some


---------18:49----------
questions about


---------18:50----------
that sort of stuff but are there any


---------18:52----------
themes that


---------18:53----------
um you know you think are particularly


---------18:55----------
important


---------18:56----------
or that you want to spend more time on


---------18:59----------
or anything that i missed


---------19:02----------
no that that all is pretty aligned with


---------19:05----------
how i felt and and you do point out


---------19:09----------
certain things like


---------19:10----------
especially the judgment on myself and


---------19:12----------
the judgment from others


---------19:14----------
one of the things i've tried to overcome


---------19:18----------
in my adulthood


---------19:19----------
is


---------19:22----------
overcoming those bad negative doubts


---------19:26----------
and and judgments that


---------19:29----------
i i received a [ __ ] ton of it


---------19:32----------
in middle school and high school from


---------19:34----------
teachers


---------19:35----------
the way that these teachers would put me


---------19:37----------
they would be so mad at me


---------19:39----------
for being in that they actually like one


---------19:41----------
of the teachers


---------19:42----------
went out of her way to make sure i was


---------19:44----------
taken out of the program at a certain


---------19:46----------
point


---------19:47----------
because she was mad that i was failing


---------19:48----------
her class and i remember that that like


---------19:51----------
really


---------19:52----------
bothered me as a kid because i'm like


---------19:53----------
it's the one thing at school


---------19:55----------
that i enjoy that i get to do and you're


---------19:58----------
taking it


---------19:59----------
because you're mad that you know about


---------20:01----------
the class stuff whatever


---------20:03----------
but at that point i had given up on on


---------20:05----------
school


---------20:06----------
and i was just like you know whatever do


---------20:08----------
what you got to do i don't really give a


---------20:09----------
[ __ ] that's fine


---------20:11----------
um but deep down it was it was this big


---------20:13----------
struggle of like


---------20:14----------
man she really went out of her way to be


---------20:16----------
that small and petty


---------20:18----------
and this same exact teacher one day i


---------20:21----------
was in her class


---------20:22----------
and we were working it was like a free


---------20:24----------
day working in groups


---------20:26----------
and she's over at the front of the class


---------20:28----------
on her desk me and my group were in the


---------20:30----------
back


---------20:30----------
doing our work and we're all doing our


---------20:33----------
work


---------20:34----------
but we start laughing and i'm laughing


---------20:38----------
with the other four kids laughing and


---------20:41----------
she goes


---------20:42----------
samantha dude


---------20:46----------
here you are laughing you're never gonna


---------20:49----------
be anything


---------20:50----------
in life this is why you're never gonna


---------20:53----------
amount to anything


---------20:54----------
and i was like and i just looked at my


---------20:58----------
friends


---------20:59----------
and i just looked back at her and i just


---------21:00----------
started laughing


---------21:02----------
because i was like holy [ __ ] does she


---------21:05----------
even know why we're live does she know


---------21:06----------
what we're talking about does she know


---------21:08----------
anything


---------21:09----------
i mean some of these these teachers and


---------21:12----------
i


---------21:12----------
i have encountered a lot of bad ones but


---------21:14----------
not to say that i didn't encounter some


---------21:16----------
amazing ones


---------21:18----------
but these bad teachers i mean did not


---------21:21----------
help my path in any way shape or form


---------21:24----------
and as an adult now i look back on them


---------21:26----------
and and i


---------21:27----------
it's like shame on them like that's


---------21:29----------
disgusting the type of things


---------21:31----------
to say that to a kid and there was


---------21:33----------
another teacher in high school


---------21:35----------
um i didn't turn in an assignment one


---------21:39----------
day


---------21:39----------
and he goes well the world's always


---------21:41----------
going to need garbage men aren't we and


---------21:43----------
he said that very loud so that the class


---------21:45----------
could hear it and i was like


---------21:47----------
i mean yeah who's gonna pick up your


---------21:49----------
garbage you know but


---------21:52----------
and i always had to overcome these


---------21:54----------
things that just because


---------21:55----------
these authoritative figures are telling


---------21:57----------
me it does not mean that it's true


---------22:00----------
and now in my adulthood i i constantly


---------22:03----------
um learn those behaviors i try to learn


---------22:07----------
why someone said that to me and i'm glad


---------22:10----------
that i know now that most of


---------22:12----------
time most of the time those things come


---------22:13----------
from within those teachers had their own


---------22:16----------
issues and maybe shouldn't be in the


---------22:19----------
positions that they're in


---------22:20----------
if they're gonna treat kids that way and


---------22:23----------
those had nothing to reflect on


---------22:25----------
me and who i am and what i'm capable of


---------22:28----------
because when i was a kid i did start to


---------22:30----------
believe them at some point


---------22:33----------
yeah i'm noticing


---------22:37----------
they said a lot of devastating things


---------22:40----------
yeah and actually the the teacher that


---------22:43----------
told me i was going to be a garbage man


---------22:45----------
was one of my ap


---------22:46----------
classes that the school kind of had to


---------22:49----------
put me in


---------22:50----------
because i tested into it and i don't


---------22:53----------
think


---------22:54----------
he ever liked me for that because he he


---------22:56----------
felt like i didn't


---------22:57----------
work my way into it or whatever i tested


---------23:00----------
into it


---------23:02----------
sure so i'm also kind of noticing that


---------23:04----------
you're the


---------23:05----------
you're the nail that sticks out of the


---------23:07----------
wall that sometimes people want to


---------23:08----------
hammer back into place


---------23:10----------
yeah um


---------23:13----------
yeah so adap that's kind of and i i


---------23:16----------
assume


---------23:17----------
your name is samantha yeah okay


---------23:20----------
i just clarifying yeah i mean hmm


---------23:25----------
let me think for a second is that okay


---------23:28----------
yeah of course


---------23:34----------
do you feel like people still try to


---------23:35----------
take things away from you


---------23:37----------
yeah can you tell us about that


---------23:41----------
um i think that


---------23:45----------
it's kind of common in people sometimes


---------23:49----------
i do try to surround myself with people


---------23:51----------
that are not this way


---------23:53----------
but i do recognize when somebody feels


---------23:56----------
some type of


---------23:57----------
threat even if i'm not doing that


---------24:00----------
and um i just pull back from them and


---------24:03----------
then i'm like


---------24:04----------
okay so first of all i'm just gonna cut


---------24:07----------
you out


---------24:08----------
you know like you're not gonna be near


---------24:10----------
me but


---------24:11----------
i i do recognize that people do


---------24:15----------
try and and take things away like my


---------24:17----------
confidence so


---------24:18----------
a reason behind my name adept the best


---------24:22----------
i my original gamer tag is only a debt


---------24:26----------
that's what it's been since the


---------24:28----------
beginning of time i'm like 10 years old


---------24:30----------
okay


---------24:31----------
but on twitch i i used to go by a.d


---------24:35----------
underscore pt because the depth was


---------24:37----------
already taken


---------24:38----------
and i would notice a lot of people


---------24:40----------
coming into my chat


---------24:42----------
and just trying to [ __ ] on me constantly


---------24:45----------
but i noticed that what made them even


---------24:48----------
angrier


---------24:49----------
and what what really made them confront


---------24:51----------
themselves


---------24:52----------
to a sense is when i wouldn't


---------24:56----------
believe it when i wouldn't accept the


---------24:59----------
things that they were telling


---------25:00----------
me and so one day i was like you know


---------25:02----------
what i need to rebrand because when you


---------25:04----------
google


---------25:05----------
ad underscore pt nothing comes up but


---------25:08----------
like some weird stuff


---------25:10----------
so i said what am i gonna do and one day


---------25:13----------
i was watching tv


---------25:14----------
and there was a guy and his name was


---------25:16----------
like phillip


---------25:18----------
duh best and he was on the hgtv show


---------25:21----------
flipper flop


---------25:23----------
and i was like man there's no way his


---------25:26----------
real name is


---------25:27----------
dub best like i refuse to this man went


---------25:30----------
down to the courthouse


---------25:32----------
and said yes sir i would like to be


---------25:34----------
called the best


---------25:35----------
and i go if that's not some


---------25:37----------
self-confidence type of level that i


---------25:39----------
want to be on i don't know what is


---------25:41----------
so i was like you know what that's my


---------25:43----------
rebranding name right there


---------25:45----------
i'm going to be a depth the best and i'm


---------25:47----------
just going to


---------25:48----------
act like i'm literally the best at


---------25:50----------
because i got tired of doubting myself


---------25:52----------
because of these things you know these


---------25:54----------
these statements and these these


---------25:56----------
devastating


---------25:57----------
i think you called it um like


---------25:59----------
interactions with people


---------26:01----------
like no i'm not gonna embrace that


---------26:03----------
anymore i'm not gonna embrace


---------26:05----------
your doubts and and your limitations


---------26:07----------
because they're not my doubts and


---------26:09----------
limitations


---------26:10----------
i know what i'm capable of and i know


---------26:12----------
what i want to achieve


---------26:13----------
i don't want to live within your


---------26:15----------
boundaries anymore


---------26:16----------
and so that's where the name of deaf the


---------26:18----------
best came from


---------26:22----------
wow


---------26:25----------
i'm going to need a second to process


---------26:27----------
all that


---------26:30----------
[Music]


---------26:34----------
can you give me an example of so aside


---------26:37----------
from sort of nebulous twitch chat is


---------26:38----------
there


---------26:39----------
a particular time more recently where


---------26:41----------
you feel like people have sort of taken


---------26:43----------
things away from you


---------26:46----------
uh from twitch yeah like aside from like


---------26:50----------
twitch chat


---------26:51----------
specifically because i mean twitch hat


---------26:52----------
shits on everybody right that's just how


---------26:54----------
they show their love


---------26:58----------
[Music]


---------27:02----------
not in a super recent time so it's okay


---------27:06----------
okay so it sounds like you've you've


---------27:07----------
really gotten adept


---------27:09----------
at cutting out toxicity from your life


---------27:13----------
um yeah i think at this point i don't


---------27:16----------
even give people the chance


---------27:18----------
to become someone that takes something


---------27:20----------
from me i mean


---------27:22----------
i know that that might sound a little


---------27:23----------
crazy because we're all people and


---------27:26----------
some of that stuff's just bound to


---------27:27----------
happen but um i'm not a person that has


---------27:30----------
many friends


---------27:31----------
i i think um i have a very odd


---------27:34----------
perception on


---------27:35----------
friendships as a whole can you help me


---------27:38----------
understand that


---------27:39----------
yeah so i don't feel like i'm somebody


---------27:43----------
that needs


---------27:44----------
friends i come from a very large family


---------27:48----------
um i i have a mom and dad that love me a


---------27:51----------
lot that are


---------27:52----------
my best friends so i talk to them a lot


---------27:55----------
i have um you know brothers sisters


---------27:58----------
cousins


---------28:00----------
i just have so many people that have


---------28:02----------
shown me what


---------28:03----------
real love is that when i find friends


---------28:07----------
that are not about


---------28:08----------
real love and support i don't want


---------28:10----------
anything


---------28:11----------
because why do we need to be friends


---------28:12----------
then like my brain can't comprehend


---------28:14----------
why do i need to be friends with you if


---------28:16----------
you can't show me real love like because


---------28:18----------
i


---------28:19----------
i do nothing but real love to people if


---------28:22----------
i if there's somebody that i feel like


---------28:24----------
i don't necessarily like or love i just


---------28:27----------
try to avoid them


---------28:29----------
i i don't go out of my way to befriend


---------28:31----------
them i have no attraction to doing that


---------28:33----------
because


---------28:34----------
i want i think it's i think there are so


---------28:37----------
many people in this world


---------28:38----------
that we can all be surrounded by people


---------28:41----------
that we love


---------28:42----------
that that also love us i think that


---------28:45----------
so i don't need the the borderline


---------28:47----------
baseline


---------28:48----------
friendship sure like the casual


---------28:50----------
friendship yeah


---------28:52----------
yeah like the exactly hey you we should


---------28:54----------
hang out sometime


---------28:55----------
sure and it never happens and then you


---------28:57----------
run into them again and they're like


---------28:58----------
hey we should hang out when never great


---------29:01----------
fantastic


---------29:02----------
exactly around yeah


---------29:06----------
um do you feel lonely


---------29:09----------
adept uh


---------29:13----------
uh when i'm extremely sad sometimes but


---------29:17----------
usually no


---------29:18----------
okay do you find yourself yeah i would


---------29:21----------
like to just add that that has a lot to


---------29:23----------
do with living in texas


---------29:24----------
because i have no family here none


---------29:28----------
so that's hard for me okay


---------29:32----------
um do you find yourself


---------29:35----------
sometimes envying people who


---------29:38----------
are able to maintain like more loose


---------29:41----------
friendships or have more friends


---------29:44----------
absolutely not okay


---------29:50----------
so i'm i'm at a little bit of a


---------29:52----------
crossroads adept


---------29:54----------
one is that you know i want to really


---------29:56----------
learn more about kind of what your


---------29:58----------
experience of growing up was


---------30:00----------
and then i also feel like you know when


---------30:03----------
people come on stream sometimes


---------30:05----------
i'll i'll try to kind of give them a


---------30:07----------
different perspective


---------30:10----------
and there are some things that uh you


---------30:11----------
know about the person that you've become


---------30:14----------
that i i'd like to um kind of challenge


---------30:18----------
some of the things that you've said and


---------30:20----------
the short answer is that


---------30:22----------
like so for example


---------30:25----------
i i i wonder if there's value in


---------30:28----------
re-examining some of your


---------30:30----------
hard-earned conclusions


---------30:34----------
um so i'll just kind of give you an


---------30:35----------
example so i think that you know you've


---------30:37----------
had like


---------30:38----------
actually like a pretty [ __ ] traumatic


---------30:40----------
interpersonal


---------30:41----------
scholastic kind of experience right and


---------30:44----------
and what tends to happen


---------30:46----------
with the body and the mind is any time


---------30:48----------
like we get a wound like we form scar


---------30:50----------
tissue


---------30:51----------
and scar tissue is sort of like in firm


---------30:54----------
it doesn't bend


---------30:55----------
it's a little bit weaker but it's


---------30:56----------
protective and so there are a lot of


---------30:58----------
things that that you're talking about


---------31:00----------
which i think sort of like make perfect


---------31:02----------
sense


---------31:03----------
i think they're very logical conclusions


---------31:05----------
i think that they're a way that you've


---------31:06----------
learned how to be happy


---------31:08----------
and at the same time i think it may be


---------31:10----------
worthwhile to like kind of question them


---------31:14----------
and i'm a little bit curious if i say


---------31:16----------
something like that


---------31:18----------
does it evoke a feeling in you that i'm


---------31:21----------
trying to take something away from you


---------31:24----------
okay when you hear that what's your


---------31:27----------
what's your like emotional or


---------31:28----------
instinctive reaction


---------31:31----------
when i hear what specifically just that


---------31:34----------
i may want to challenge some of the


---------31:35----------
conclusions you've come to


---------31:36----------
oh i love it um i think an important


---------31:39----------
thing to do is just


---------31:41----------
always look at your behaviors is is it


---------31:44----------
the right thing to do is it healthy are


---------31:46----------
you helping yourself so


---------31:47----------
i i love it and i'm not a i'm not


---------31:51----------
opposed to that at all can i um


---------31:54----------
can you do me a favor yeah can you let


---------31:58----------
me know


---------31:59----------
if you feel like i am trying to take


---------32:01----------
something away from you


---------32:03----------
or if i am sort of slipping into the


---------32:05----------
role of like


---------32:08----------
[ __ ] teacher okay okay


---------32:11----------
yeah can please do that for me if i yeah


---------32:14----------
if i step into that role like you got to


---------32:15----------
let me know you got to call me out on it


---------32:17----------
okay is that cool okay yeah um


---------32:22----------
so okay so you so you're okay with me


---------32:26----------
challenging you a little bit


---------32:27----------
yeah okay so i'm still gonna go back and


---------32:30----------
ask you more questions but i'm glad i


---------32:32----------
have your permission for that and if


---------32:33----------
something comes up i'll let you know


---------32:34----------
okay okay but let me just give you kind


---------32:37----------
of one quick example of what i mean


---------32:38----------
so it sounds like um you know you're


---------32:41----------
quick to cut people


---------32:42----------
out of your life and you're really close


---------32:44----------
to your family you're really close to


---------32:46----------
you know having people that like


---------32:48----------
it you're kind of all in in your


---------32:50----------
relationships right so like


---------32:52----------
if people are like gonna respect you and


---------32:55----------
love you then


---------32:56----------
that's awesome and you're gonna respect


---------32:57----------
and love them and that's awesome


---------32:59----------
[Music]


---------33:01----------
yeah not really i mean i can cut people


---------33:04----------
off quickly


---------33:05----------
but i'm also a believer in like um


---------33:09----------
finding a solution i think


---------33:12----------
so if somebody's willing to chill and


---------33:15----------
work towards a solution that's fine


---------33:17----------
but if they're showing me repetitive


---------33:20----------
signs of just


---------33:21----------
like i i think it's important for


---------33:24----------
someone to care about themselves


---------33:25----------
first and foremost and i feel like they


---------33:28----------
don't even care about themselves


---------33:29----------
then that takes time to recognize that


---------33:32----------
type of thing


---------33:33----------
and so no offense but if they're not a


---------33:35----------
close friend of mine yes i do cut them


---------33:37----------
out


---------33:38----------
because i i don't want to


---------33:41----------
get sucked into those things because


---------33:44----------
this takes a p


---------33:45----------
this is a whole process like if i try to


---------33:48----------
give them perspective that i don't think


---------33:50----------
they care about themselves that they


---------33:51----------
don't think they're doing things that


---------33:52----------
are healthy for them


---------33:54----------
and they just ignore it and blow over it


---------33:56----------
and act like it's fine and they're


---------33:57----------
they're okay i i feel like okay um


---------34:01----------
well i don't know like i don't want to


---------34:03----------
get sucked into doing the same thing


---------34:05----------
that sounds


---------34:06----------
healthy yeah yeah i mean it sounds like


---------34:09----------
you know people


---------34:11----------
you're not going to kind of i think


---------34:13----------
actually a lot of people make this


---------34:14----------
mistake where they like


---------34:15----------
try to convince other people that they


---------34:17----------
have a problem


---------34:20----------
you know and and that you know toxicity


---------34:23----------
towards you isn't really about you


---------34:26----------
it it's really kind of coming from them


---------34:28----------
yeah


---------34:29----------
i guess the one question that i have is


---------34:31----------
like


---------34:32----------
how how do you know that


---------34:35----------
right so like if you say you know this


---------34:38----------
is toxicity coming from the other person


---------34:40----------
it's really like hatred on their part it


---------34:42----------
really has nothing to do


---------34:43----------
with me how do you know when it has


---------34:46----------
something to do with you and when it


---------34:47----------
doesn't


---------34:50----------
um i think it depends like what are the


---------34:53----------
things that they're actually


---------34:54----------
saying to me like i've had a friend


---------34:57----------
before come to me and say


---------34:59----------
hey um this and this has happened


---------35:02----------
this is how it makes me feel this is how


---------35:05----------
if the situation has evolved


---------35:07----------
you know like that type of discussion


---------35:10----------
is a i'm being toxic what can i


---------35:14----------
evaluate and change versus something


---------35:18----------
that's more like projection like i mean


---------35:22----------
projection is


---------35:25----------
a literal word i feel like it literally


---------35:29----------
projects at you they're not discussing


---------35:31----------
with you they're not talking to you


---------35:32----------
about it


---------35:33----------
it is projected at you so yeah so


---------35:36----------
that's how i know yeah so i i see what


---------35:39----------
you're saying so you're able to sort of


---------35:41----------
detect projection


---------35:43----------
from another person and that's kind of


---------35:46----------
how you know and and that if people sort


---------35:47----------
of


---------35:48----------
approach you in a mature manner they're


---------35:50----------
willing to kind of discuss


---------35:51----------
and then you're willing to like you know


---------35:53----------
if you guys have a discussion about it


---------35:54----------
you'll own the parts that you're doing


---------35:56----------
wrong


---------35:56----------
they'll own the parts that they're doing


---------35:58----------
wrong that's a healthy relationship


---------36:00----------
absolutely yeah so um can we go back to


---------36:04----------
that teacher that worked really hard to


---------36:05----------
get you out of


---------36:06----------
out of their class yeah um


---------36:09----------
can you tell tell me what what help me


---------36:13----------
understand


---------36:13----------
what they did that was so like how do


---------36:15----------
you know that they kind of worked really


---------36:17----------
hard to get you out of their class like


---------36:18----------
went out she told me


---------36:19----------
she talked to me about it and she told


---------36:21----------
me she told me


---------36:24----------
she said i mean first she threatened me


---------36:26----------
she said


---------36:27----------
just so you know i have a meeting with


---------36:30----------
this person and this person and this


---------36:32----------
person and and


---------36:34----------
you know she had her buddy buddy teacher


---------36:36----------
that was also


---------36:37----------
um because at that school you had a home


---------36:39----------
room and then you had to swap with the


---------36:41----------
teacher next door


---------36:42----------
and then and then you'd go to your other


---------36:44----------
classes um and so she had her buddy


---------36:47----------
buddy


---------36:47----------
and she goes you know me and her we feel


---------36:49----------
the same way about you


---------36:51----------
and blah blah blah and in your notes


---------36:53----------
throughout uh because


---------36:55----------
in fifth grade my teacher ended up


---------36:57----------
becoming the principal


---------36:59----------
later on so what he did was he put it in


---------37:02----------
my


---------37:02----------
file um some things that he felt


---------37:05----------
personally towards me and he sent it on


---------37:08----------
to the next school


---------37:09----------
and then that carried on and over so


---------37:11----------
that this was sixth seventh grade where


---------37:13----------
that teacher


---------37:14----------
was doing this stuff and so she was like


---------37:17----------
in your file


---------37:18----------
mr so and so said all this blah blah


---------37:20----------
blah we're gonna


---------37:21----------
sit down and i was like okay that's fine


---------37:25----------
you know like i i don't i never gave in


---------37:28----------
to these teachers


---------37:29----------
um my mom always raised me


---------37:33----------
where if if adults have a child like a


---------37:37----------
problem with you they need to speak to


---------37:39----------
me


---------37:39----------
it shouldn't be a thing where they're


---------37:40----------
talking to you so every time that these


---------37:43----------
authoritative figures tried like it


---------37:45----------
always felt like


---------37:46----------
like an embarrassment attempt and they


---------37:48----------
were never gonna do that


---------37:50----------
to me because like my mom taught me


---------37:53----------
better than that


---------37:54----------
so all it made me do was like


---------37:57----------
they would teach me uh they would treat


---------38:00----------
me


---------38:01----------
as though i was a kid that was there to


---------38:03----------
harass their class


---------38:05----------
and [ __ ] everything up i wasn't that


---------38:06----------
type of student i just didn't do my


---------38:08----------
own stuff sure but i wasn't the type you


---------38:11----------
weren't like


---------38:12----------
throwing stuff at her when she was


---------38:14----------
turned around yeah it wasn't disruptive


---------38:16----------
do you know what it said in your file no


---------38:19----------
that i wasn't allowed to see


---------38:20----------
but that's what they did tell me and i


---------38:23----------
was told this by multiple people


---------38:25----------
so it's kind of hard to imagine it to be


---------38:28----------
fake


---------38:28----------
so i i think it it totally makes sense


---------38:31----------
that i mean i think it's a terrible


---------38:32----------
power dynamic to you know


---------38:34----------
tell a fifth grader that you're coming


---------38:36----------
for them


---------38:37----------
yeah i'm i'm gonna let you down like it


---------38:39----------
sounds very


---------38:40----------
like like predatory yeah


---------38:43----------
i agree and i think it's a really


---------38:46----------
valuable lesson that your


---------38:47----------
your mom taught you and something that


---------38:49----------
it's i'm happy you ingrained


---------38:51----------
i i find myself being a little bit


---------38:53----------
curious about you know what


---------38:54----------
what did they say to you though so they


---------38:56----------
just said that their meetings and like


---------38:58----------
what


---------38:59----------
what were they trying i mean


---------39:02----------
um well their whole thing was you're not


---------39:05----------
gonna come to my class


---------39:07----------
and not do my work that i give you and


---------39:10----------
then go off and do your


---------39:11----------
your gait program and then do everything


---------39:15----------
there


---------39:15----------
so they were mad that i would do my


---------39:17----------
stuff there and not in their classes


---------39:19----------
and i tried to tell them well the


---------39:21----------
difference between your class and that


---------39:23----------
is i've been learning exactly what


---------39:24----------
you're teaching for four years


---------39:26----------
but i've never learned this before and


---------39:28----------
this is fun and that's exciting


---------39:30----------
so yeah i do it but they thought it was


---------39:32----------
like i don't know they thought because


---------39:34----------
we did arts and crafts sometime like


---------39:36----------
like we learned about real actual


---------39:38----------
artists and painters and stuff they


---------39:40----------
thought it was like


---------39:41----------
some fun escape you know because she


---------39:42----------
wasn't involved in the gate program


---------39:44----------
she's the [ __ ] teacher they were not


---------39:45----------
gonna let her near there like no offense


---------39:47----------
but


---------39:48----------
they're never gonna let her near there


---------39:49----------
so she had no idea what we actually did


---------39:51----------
there i guess


---------39:52----------
i mean that's the only conclusion i


---------39:54----------
could draw from it because she


---------39:55----------
she treated me like it was like some


---------39:58----------
escape to have fun and i'm like it's not


---------40:00----------
it's fun but we learn we're learning


---------40:03----------
important things


---------40:05----------
yeah so i'm just a little bit curious


---------40:07----------
like if i play devil's advocate for a


---------40:09----------
second i'm just thinking about you know


---------40:10----------
if i have a student who's failing


---------40:12----------
my class and then there's like the


---------40:15----------
curriculum and there's the extra


---------40:16----------
curriculum


---------40:18----------
i could see an argument for saying like


---------40:20----------
oh like you know


---------40:21----------
they shouldn't be doing extracurricular


---------40:22----------
stuff i don't think it's a good argument


---------40:24----------
um but i could definitely see like a


---------40:27----------
perspective where it's like sort of like


---------40:28----------
if there's extracurricular stuff in


---------40:30----------
curricular stuff


---------40:31----------
you know if you're go after school if


---------40:34----------
you're failing your classes and you're


---------40:35----------
going in


---------40:36----------
and doing stuff like it would actually


---------40:38----------
be in your best interest to focus on


---------40:40----------
passing the class right what do you


---------40:42----------
think so you wanted me to tell you


---------40:43----------
when you were being like the [ __ ]


---------40:46----------
teacher yep that's what they did to me


---------40:48----------
constantly that's exactly what the


---------40:50----------
principal and the other teachers would


---------40:52----------
tell me about her


---------40:54----------
and it's like that's fine then i don't


---------40:56----------
like you guys have your pact


---------40:57----------
that's cool that's fine but the


---------40:59----------
difference is


---------41:01----------
and that they all should have understood


---------41:03----------
is that it's


---------41:04----------
it's extracurricular that is more


---------41:06----------
advanced


---------41:07----------
that is more challenging that teaches


---------41:09----------
them something new


---------41:11----------
that that shows a problem in our current


---------41:14----------
curriculum then


---------41:15----------
because if she was learning new


---------41:16----------
different things all day she would be


---------41:18----------
[ __ ] doing it


---------41:20----------
that was the issue that i had with them


---------41:22----------
is that


---------41:23----------
i don't want to continue to learn the


---------41:25----------
same it's not even


---------41:27----------
sometimes i would want to learn


---------41:28----------
sometimes i would sit there and i'd get


---------41:30----------
so mad at myself


---------41:31----------
why am i not paying attention why am i


---------41:33----------
not able to do this why can't i sit down


---------41:35----------
and do it for hours on end sometimes i


---------41:37----------
would get as frustrated as them


---------41:39----------
at myself but the thing is when it came


---------41:42----------
to challenging things and


---------41:43----------
always keeping the ball moving i had no


---------41:46----------
problems i didn't suffer those same


---------41:48----------
curses it wasn't the same sure


---------41:52----------
so can i ask you so so did you feel like


---------41:54----------
i was being


---------41:55----------
an [ __ ] teacher in that moment or was


---------41:58----------
i just saying the things that they said


---------42:00----------
you're just literally mirroring the


---------42:02----------
things that they would say


---------42:04----------
and and how did you so it sounds like


---------42:08----------
let me just think for a second try to


---------42:09----------
process what you just said


---------42:12----------
and so what you're saying is that like


---------42:14----------
it wasn't about


---------42:16----------
it being extracurricular or not


---------42:18----------
extracurricular it was just


---------42:19----------
since school was so old for you


---------42:22----------
the extra stuff was actually like new


---------42:26----------
things that you could actually learn


---------42:28----------
so if people presented you with like the


---------42:30----------
opportunity to learn


---------42:31----------
you'd do it but if they just presented


---------42:33----------
you with the opportunity to like repeat


---------42:35----------
old [ __ ]


---------42:36----------
like you wouldn't do it i would get very


---------42:38----------
frustrated


---------42:39----------
like it's not that i would look at it


---------42:41----------
and go ugh i've done this before


---------42:43----------
that's not the problem the problem is


---------42:45----------
they would sit there


---------42:46----------
on the board for an hour two hour but


---------42:49----------
however long they would sit there


---------42:51----------
then i would know that i have to go home


---------42:53----------
and do that work that she just made me


---------42:55----------
re-watch for the millionth time


---------42:56----------
and i wouldn't even open it because i'd


---------42:58----------
be so frustrated like


---------43:00----------
i it was hard for me because i'd be like


---------43:04----------
why am i doing this what's happening i


---------43:06----------
couldn't grasp it


---------43:10----------
you couldn't grasp why you couldn't do


---------43:12----------
the work


---------43:13----------
why i had to keep doing it again


---------43:19----------
like it was it was like a dread it was


---------43:21----------
like a dreadful feeling


---------43:22----------
deep down like i have to open that book


---------43:25----------
and do it


---------43:26----------
all again you know like that's what i


---------43:28----------
have to spend my time on


---------43:30----------
and the thing is that it would be a lot


---------43:32----------
it would be a lot of it it's not like it


---------43:34----------
was just three four questions it would


---------43:35----------
be a ton of it


---------43:37----------
and that for me as a kid that was very


---------43:39----------
hard it was like


---------43:41----------
i dread the fact that i have to go back


---------43:43----------
there do it again


---------43:44----------
do it tomorrow like i was so i would


---------43:46----------
think that way sounds like you were


---------43:48----------
tomorrow i have to do it all week


---------43:49----------
that's what it felt like trapped sort of


---------43:52----------
in this like prison of like


---------43:54----------
rote boring school work that's what it


---------43:57----------
felt like


---------43:58----------
like it felt like punishment so it was


---------44:01----------
hard for me to want to do it


---------44:03----------
because i just felt like i was being


---------44:04----------
punished all the time yeah help me


---------44:06----------
understand that when did you start to


---------44:08----------
feel like school was punishment


---------44:10----------
uh like sixth grade for sure because


---------44:14----------
fourth and fifth grade


---------44:15----------
it was still kind of like okay this


---------44:18----------
sucks


---------44:18----------
but you know it'll get better especially


---------44:21----------
once i go


---------44:22----------
to a new school sixth grade's supposed


---------44:23----------
to be harder


---------44:25----------
it's supposed to be new new ideas new


---------44:27----------
things


---------44:29----------
but then the stuff that wasn't new it


---------44:31----------
was just like


---------44:33----------
like it felt as though


---------44:37----------
math and and i love math i love math


---------44:40----------
with like my whole heart


---------44:43----------
it just felt like english and math


---------44:46----------
and mostly those were our core subjects


---------44:50----------
that we had to spend most of our time on


---------44:53----------
and then we were allowed to go learn new


---------44:55----------
and explore new things and


---------44:56----------
and be taught new because even in sixth


---------44:59----------
seventh grade


---------45:00----------
like here's what my day looked like i


---------45:02----------
had to start with


---------45:04----------
english and i think maybe history


---------45:08----------
which i'm not a big history person but i


---------45:10----------
still did it i was okay


---------45:12----------
um then i'd have to go to math and


---------45:14----------
science


---------45:16----------
but it was in that order so i would do


---------45:18----------
the english stuff that i've been


---------45:20----------
learning the whole time


---------45:21----------
reading and the thing is a lot of kids


---------45:24----------
were behind


---------45:26----------
like my reading level so it'd be kind of


---------45:29----------
frustrating to know that


---------45:30----------
i was the one being picked on by


---------45:32----------
teachers but i'm the one that knows how


---------45:34----------
to read


---------45:36----------
so why the [ __ ] do i have all the


---------45:37----------
attention on me if i'm the one that


---------45:39----------
knows how to read


---------45:40----------
like why aren't they helping them why so


---------45:42----------
that we can all move on and progress and


---------45:43----------
not have to do these same things over


---------45:45----------
and over again


---------45:47----------
um and sounds like you were really kind


---------45:50----------
of persecuted


---------45:52----------
which is strange because you knew how to


---------45:54----------
read


---------45:55----------
i mean it felt like it yeah and you know


---------45:58----------
you know when the teacher they


---------46:00----------
they raised then they go can anybody


---------46:01----------
answer this we're not moving on till


---------46:03----------
anybody answers it


---------46:05----------
can anyone answer i would always be the


---------46:07----------
one to speak up and answer it so that we


---------46:08----------
could all move on and do something else


---------46:10----------
like


---------46:11----------
i i would always help the teacher and


---------46:13----------
when i saw them frustrated


---------46:15----------
i always tried to help them but when


---------46:17----------
they saw me frustrated


---------46:18----------
it was like oh you're a bad kid and i


---------46:21----------
hated that


---------46:22----------
but so it would be repetitive repetitive


---------46:25----------
repetitive


---------46:26----------
and then pe and then um


---------46:29----------
i had an electronics class so i learned


---------46:31----------
how to make circuit boards and things


---------46:32----------
like that and


---------46:33----------
and then we had some other type of you


---------46:36----------
know elective


---------46:37----------
random class so it was like prison


---------46:39----------
prison prison prison


---------46:41----------
okay now we get to learn okay now we get


---------46:43----------
to be kids


---------46:44----------
now we get to do something


---------46:49----------
adept i'm i'm sensing a lot of strength


---------46:53----------
but also like strength that's built on a


---------46:56----------
mountain of hurt


---------46:59----------
yeah i feel like that's where all my


---------47:01----------
strength comes from is just being like


---------47:03----------
[ __ ] on and stifled all the time


---------47:07----------
that's where i feel like it comes from


---------47:09----------
that's so sad


---------47:12----------
gotta do what you gotta do


---------47:17----------
that's also a very sad sentiment right


---------47:24----------
it's sad and i've cried about it


---------47:27----------
and i've been sad over it but at the


---------47:30----------
same time


---------47:31----------
it's just what happened i can't change


---------47:34----------
what happened i can't change those


---------47:37----------
people and how they stifled me


---------47:39----------
i could only change how that affects me


---------47:41----------
and what i do with that


---------47:43----------
and that's it that's all that i'll focus


---------47:44----------
on does it need to change


---------47:48----------
no but i'm just saying i i


---------47:52----------
the the change where it needs to happen


---------47:55----------
is how we teach children how we


---------47:58----------
encourage children


---------48:01----------
and i believe in that so much that i


---------48:03----------
actually taught basketball for seven


---------48:05----------
years


---------48:06----------
and i only taught youth basketball and


---------48:09----------
i would make sure that if they were


---------48:12----------
struggling in school if they're


---------48:14----------
struggling at home whatever in


---------48:15----------
basketball


---------48:16----------
i was there i taught them i helped them


---------48:18----------
i gave them every piece of guidance and


---------48:20----------
advice


---------48:21----------
and you know self-confidence


---------48:23----------
self-assurance everything that i could


---------48:26----------
and i mean my teams did very well


---------48:29----------
and they loved each other they loved me


---------48:31----------
i loved them and


---------48:32----------
it was great that sounds awesome


---------48:35----------
you know it's interesting because we


---------48:36----------
always think that you know the best way


---------48:38----------
to like learn


---------48:39----------
something good like the best way to be a


---------48:40----------
good teacher is to study under good


---------48:43----------
teachers


---------48:44----------
but i think sometimes the best way to


---------48:45----------
learn how to be a


---------48:47----------
good teacher is to have bad teachers i


---------48:50----------
certainly know that i learned


---------48:52----------
um a lot about how


---------48:55----------
i teach and learn medicine i i i learned


---------48:59----------
a lot about how i teach medicine from


---------49:02----------
bad teachers because like you have a


---------49:04----------
teacher you're like i am never going to


---------49:06----------
do that


---------49:06----------
that is terrible and


---------49:10----------
and not only that but i i loved my


---------49:13----------
community where i grew up it's a little


---------49:15----------
town in southern california


---------49:18----------
and i was like i don't want these kids


---------49:22----------
to feel the way that i felt and so i'm


---------49:25----------
gonna make sure that my community is


---------49:27----------
like


---------49:27----------
evolving from the ground up like it's my


---------49:29----------
turn now i'm the adult


---------49:31----------
i'm going to be the one that goes in


---------49:33----------
there and and teaches them the way that


---------49:35----------
i wish


---------49:35----------
that i was taught the way that these


---------49:37----------
teachers taught me not the way that


---------49:39----------
these ones taught me


---------49:40----------
yeah so adap let me ask you a question


---------49:43----------
so so it sounds like you know a lot of


---------49:45----------
your strength kind of


---------49:46----------
comes from the idea that these teachers


---------49:50----------
were wrong


---------49:51----------
right that they were projecting so what


---------49:54----------
would happen


---------49:55----------
if it turned out that those teachers


---------49:58----------
were right


---------50:01----------
um


---------50:05----------
i mean i guess that would mean that i


---------50:07----------
had given up


---------50:10----------
it means that i would have finally


---------50:12----------
succumbed to their doubts


---------50:14----------
like just be a subject just be a pawn of


---------50:18----------
their doubts i don't know how to


---------50:19----------
put that into word yeah so what i'm


---------50:21----------
saying is that that it's not that you


---------50:22----------
would have been a pawn of their doubts


---------50:24----------
but that


---------50:25----------
that their doubts were accurate right


---------50:27----------
that


---------50:29----------
what do you think would happen to you in


---------50:30----------
the way that you view yourself


---------50:34----------
i don't know


---------50:37----------
so i have a weird kind of thing for you


---------50:40----------
to think about so what if i were to tell


---------50:41----------
you that nothing would happen if they


---------50:43----------
were right


---------50:47----------
because here's the here's the one thing


---------50:49----------
that kind of


---------50:52----------
rubs me the wrong way about your story


---------50:55----------
of strength so i think you're a very


---------50:56----------
strong person i think you're clearly a


---------50:58----------
good teacher i think you're clearly


---------50:59----------
gifted


---------51:00----------
i think that um you've had to deal with


---------51:03----------
a lot of pain and hardship


---------51:06----------
and yet there's a part of me that just


---------51:08----------
feels like


---------51:10----------
that that's you and that whether people


---------51:13----------
doubted you or didn't doubt you your


---------51:15----------
strength is your own


---------51:17----------
and that your strength exists in spite


---------51:21----------
like so your strength kind of grew out


---------51:23----------
of the fertilizer of like


---------51:25----------
frustration and doubt right and


---------51:28----------
and there's a part of me that says that


---------51:30----------
like that's actually sort of


---------51:32----------
i mean that's true but that actually


---------51:34----------
like


---------51:36----------
let's say let's take your basketball


---------51:38----------
kids for example


---------51:39----------
so that your teachers don't have to be


---------51:41----------
wrong about you


---------51:43----------
for you to give what you did to your


---------51:45----------
basketball teams


---------51:47----------
right they could even be right and like


---------51:49----------
they can even have a point


---------51:50----------
and just because they're right doesn't


---------51:53----------
actually change


---------51:54----------
anything about you well i mean


---------51:58----------
exactly which is why when you ask me


---------52:00----------
what if they were right i mean i


---------52:01----------
i don't think anything of that because i


---------52:04----------
think regardless i still would have been


---------52:06----------
the person that i


---------52:07----------
am one way shape or form maybe i just


---------52:10----------
have different trauma


---------52:11----------
that's it i i don't


---------52:15----------
like i i my brain i can't even


---------52:18----------
really process what you mean with that


---------52:20----------
type of question like


---------52:22----------
oh what if they were right well i mean i


---------52:24----------
don't i'm here


---------52:25----------
this is the life that i'm in so it's


---------52:27----------
like my brain can't even wrap my head


---------52:29----------
around your question


---------52:31----------
that i think is makes me really happy so


---------52:34----------
i think that's sort of like so so here


---------52:36----------
so i'll just can i just share a couple


---------52:38----------
of random thoughts adapt


---------52:39----------
yeah so the first thing is that i think


---------52:41----------
you have um


---------52:42----------
something that we see a lot which is


---------52:44----------
sort of like a reactive ego


---------52:47----------
so like your ego and your sense of self


---------52:49----------
is built out of kind of like defiance of


---------52:52----------
projections of the others


---------52:54----------
and at the same time so there's like


---------52:56----------
there's a sense of identity that's like


---------52:58----------
[ __ ] you guys i'm not gonna


---------53:00----------
like i'm not gonna let you determine who


---------53:01----------
i am which is


---------53:03----------
good but i would even i would argue that


---------53:06----------
that's still ego and at the end of the


---------53:09----------
day that's i know sounds weird is


---------53:10----------
unhealthy


---------53:11----------
and then there's your genuine strength


---------53:14----------
which is not


---------53:15----------
built out of defiance of anything but


---------53:18----------
it's built out of like


---------53:19----------
love and care and like wanting to create


---------53:21----------
it like a good life for other people


---------53:23----------
and the funny thing is that i see both


---------53:25----------
in you i see a very genuine strength


---------53:27----------
i see a very genuine capability i think


---------53:30----------
we've seen it actually all along


---------53:32----------
in the stories of like you teaching


---------53:34----------
other kids where you


---------53:36----------
knew what your worth was right and then


---------53:38----------
parallel to that


---------53:40----------
we have this really common i mean this


---------53:41----------
is just how things work so like when


---------53:43----------
you know when teachers are threatening


---------53:45----------
you in the fifth grade that they're


---------53:46----------
they're gonna come hunt you down and


---------53:48----------
they've written things in your file and


---------53:50----------
it'll be there forever


---------53:51----------
so our psychology has a very natural way


---------53:54----------
of responding to that because you don't


---------53:55----------
know


---------53:56----------
your real strength that time right and


---------53:59----------
so until you like grow up and you


---------54:01----------
understand what your real value is


---------54:03----------
you form this sort of protective ego


---------54:06----------
which is like oh like that's them


---------54:08----------
projecting which is like kind of


---------54:10----------
interesting because like


---------54:11----------
you know the tricky thing about blaming


---------54:13----------
someone else for projecting


---------54:15----------
is that it gives you a perfect pass


---------54:17----------
against all criticism


---------54:19----------
now it sounds that your it sounds like


---------54:21----------
you actually


---------54:22----------
genuinely get around that because if


---------54:24----------
someone approaches you in a respectful


---------54:26----------
manner and has something critical to say


---------54:28----------
you're very open-minded about it and


---------54:30----------
that i think comes from your genuine


---------54:32----------
strength


---------54:33----------
but there's this sort of like it's weird


---------54:35----------
because you actually have a lot of


---------54:36----------
genuine strength where you're


---------54:37----------
open-minded you're really confident in


---------54:39----------
who you are


---------54:40----------
you're willing to accept criticism you


---------54:42----------
try to be better


---------54:43----------
um you know you try to live up to like


---------54:45----------
the responsibilities that you have in


---------54:47----------
your authentic relationships


---------54:49----------
all is good and this is really strange


---------54:50----------
because bizarrely i also notice


---------54:53----------
notes of this other thing which is


---------54:56----------
yeah i don't have the same perception on


---------54:59----------
ego


---------55:00----------
i know that um people tell me a lot like


---------55:03----------
oh


---------55:03----------
ego this you go that i don't have the


---------55:06----------
same perception


---------55:07----------
and i and i don't you know i i don't


---------55:11----------
um i would


---------55:14----------
help anyone do anything that i have done


---------55:19----------
i i want to help anyone get over


---------55:22----------
all the hurt that i have come over to


---------55:25----------
get over all of the


---------55:26----------
self-doubt the um insecurities


---------55:30----------
the whatever it is i i


---------55:34----------
use my twitch all the time to share


---------55:37----------
how i got over all of those things


---------55:41----------
so you can tell me i have an ego all


---------55:43----------
that you want and not just you but like


---------55:45----------
anyone in this world can say that i have


---------55:48----------
ego that i have this side of me that is


---------55:50----------
um like it is more of like a facade


---------55:54----------
because i'm on twitch because of


---------55:56----------
everything yes there is that ego part


---------55:58----------
that will not let you get through


---------56:01----------
to the genuine strength the real person


---------56:04----------
because you don't have to do that like i


---------56:06----------
get very disappointed in people that


---------56:08----------
project


---------56:09----------
that tried to tear something down or


---------56:11----------
whatever it's like why are you doing


---------56:12----------
that


---------56:13----------
you don't have to do that here you know


---------56:15----------
you don't have to do it anywhere but


---------56:17----------
especially not here when you talk to me


---------56:18----------
and you don't need that


---------56:20----------
wait can that was really i have so many


---------56:24----------
questions


---------56:25----------
can you help me understand what so when


---------56:27----------
you say talk a lot i'm sorry


---------56:29----------
no i love it i think it's great i'm so


---------56:31----------
curious about


---------56:32----------
um because i i think adapt you've


---------56:36----------
really wrangled with this stuff for so


---------56:38----------
long i'm i really want to understand


---------56:41----------
you know what you've learned through


---------56:43----------
these struggles so when you say that


---------56:45----------
that you know you understand that


---------56:47----------
there's an ego what what are you hearing


---------56:49----------
me say


---------56:50----------
and what's your perspective on ego


---------56:53----------
why don't we start there just tell me


---------56:54----------
how do you understand there you go


---------56:56----------
so i mean


---------57:00----------
i i think that there's there is


---------57:04----------
ego and i know i know when someone's


---------57:07----------
being egotistical


---------57:09----------
and i understand that and i know that i


---------57:11----------
have behaviors that are egotistical


---------57:13----------
i understand that what's an example of a


---------57:16----------
behavior that's egotistical real quick


---------57:18----------
just so we're on the same page


---------57:19----------
um


---------57:20----------
[Music]


---------57:24----------
the only thing i can think of is like


---------57:26----------
gaming or something


---------57:27----------
so get back shitties when you're no like


---------57:30----------
like uh like even


---------57:32----------
uh harder than that you know like i get


---------57:34----------
reg shitty i'm just messing with you


---------57:36----------
but if i tell you that i would 1v1 wipe


---------57:38----------
your ass like


---------57:39----------
[ __ ] on any floor in any game ever in


---------57:41----------
the history of games you wouldn't be


---------57:43----------
able to touch me


---------57:44----------
i genuinely mean it and i am being


---------57:46----------
egotistical i don't care even if i'm


---------57:47----------
wrong i don't care you're


---------57:49----------
it's gonna happen like we'll figure it


---------57:51----------
out you know um


---------57:52----------
so that's ego i guess sure


---------57:55----------
um because i do get angry and i will


---------57:58----------
tell that to people


---------58:01----------
um good for you yeah so


---------58:05----------
that is ego and but the thing is my my


---------58:08----------
sense


---------58:08----------
on ego is i don't bring that egotistical


---------58:13----------
side that those things out until i see


---------58:16----------
somebody


---------58:17----------
trying to threaten to get in


---------58:21----------
yeah so let me clarify a little bit okay


---------58:24----------
so you're using the word ego and you're


---------58:25----------
also using the word egotistical and i


---------58:27----------
should have explained a little bit


---------58:28----------
better


---------58:29----------
sure so i'm kind of operating using the


---------58:31----------
yogic term


---------58:32----------
ego which is like an identity or a sense


---------58:35----------
of identity that is actually


---------58:37----------
built up around the core of who you are


---------58:40----------
and is by definition false


---------58:43----------
so we all have ego it's a function of


---------58:45----------
the mind it's like one of the parts of


---------58:47----------
mind it's like


---------58:47----------
emotion like we all have an identity the


---------58:49----------
technical term is the sanskrit term


---------58:51----------
ahamkar


---------58:52----------
which means the sense of i or the i


---------58:55----------
feeling


---------58:56----------
so when i for example wake up and i say


---------58:58----------
i'm a doctor or i am a twitch streamer


---------59:01----------
or when you say you are a woman


---------59:03----------
that is like an attribute of your being


---------59:05----------
which is technically not true


---------59:07----------
so like i'm not i mean i could say i'm a


---------59:10----------
doctor and society could think i'm a


---------59:12----------
doctor but like


---------59:12----------
if you dissect me you're not gonna find


---------59:15----------
a doctor anywhere


---------59:16----------
right it's like a construction does that


---------59:19----------
make sense


---------59:21----------
a little okay so like like for example


---------59:25----------
anyway so so so i'll let me explain let


---------59:28----------
me just think about how to explain this


---------59:29----------
so we all have attributes of our


---------59:32----------
identity


---------59:33----------
and and like in ancient india like the


---------59:35----------
yogis believed that like none of the


---------59:37----------
attributes of our identity


---------59:39----------
actually define who we are so if i were


---------59:42----------
to ask you


---------59:43----------
are you a failure what would your answer


---------59:47----------
be


---------59:49----------
no okay did you fail out of high school


---------59:53----------
yes then how are you not a failure


---------59:58----------
i don't know exactly because you're not


---------60:01----------
a failure right so that's an


---------60:02----------
attribute which you're in your truest


---------60:05----------
sense of self


---------60:06----------
you actually aren't a failure like just


---------60:08----------
because you're [ __ ] teachers like


---------60:09----------
just because you dropped out like that's


---------60:11----------
it's all a [ __ ] mental construction


---------60:13----------
that you can't


---------60:14----------
like sure you can find an f on a


---------60:15----------
transcript somewhere on a piece of paper


---------60:17----------
but that's not who you are right


---------60:21----------
and and so the yogis sort of figured out


---------60:23----------
that like we can have all of these


---------60:25----------
attributes that we can apply to our


---------60:27----------
lives and our identity


---------60:28----------
but none of those are our true self


---------60:32----------
and what i and this is the thing that i


---------60:33----------
think is so bizarre is that you


---------60:35----------
sometimes think and i think the ego is a


---------60:37----------
protective mechanism so the yogis also


---------60:38----------
say this


---------60:39----------
that the ego is basically there to tank


---------60:41----------
for us


---------60:43----------
from like damage and so the ego starts


---------60:45----------
to develop whenever we take damage i.e


---------60:47----------
when you're a fifth grader


---------60:49----------
and you know teachers are like hunting


---------60:51----------
you


---------60:52----------
and you're feeling trapped and you're


---------60:54----------
feeling dread like ego is


---------60:55----------
what protects you right like ego is like


---------60:58----------
what steps forward and says


---------60:59----------
you don't understand me everything that


---------61:01----------
you're saying is wrong


---------61:03----------
i'm not what you think i am i am


---------61:05----------
something else


---------61:06----------
and when you say to yourself i am


---------61:08----------
something else


---------61:10----------
that is the ahamkar that is the ego


---------61:13----------
if you say to yourself i am a success or


---------61:16----------
i am a failure


---------61:17----------
those are both the yogic ego because


---------61:19----------
when someone says i am a failure like


---------61:21----------
that's not


---------61:22----------
egotistical but it's part of like the


---------61:24----------
yogic concept of ego


---------61:26----------
does that make sense yeah okay and so


---------61:29----------
this is the wild thing


---------61:30----------
is that when people attack you


---------61:34----------
your ego steps forward but i think what


---------61:36----------
would actually be like really amazing


---------61:38----------
is that if it didn't because actually


---------61:41----------
when they attack you


---------61:44----------
what's on the inside is really where


---------61:46----------
your strength comes from


---------61:49----------
and that actually can't be touched by


---------61:51----------
them and you don't even need your ego to


---------61:52----------
protect


---------61:55----------
right so


---------61:59----------
the thing is though i mean as a kid


---------62:04----------
those things penetrated


---------62:08----------
yep those things were believed yep


---------62:11----------
um now that i look back on them like


---------62:14----------
i don't i don't really have an ego when


---------62:17----------
i talk back on these teachers


---------62:19----------
i think that i genuinely understand


---------62:22----------
why they were the way that they were and


---------62:25----------
i've come to


---------62:26----------
accept it do i think that it's wrong yes


---------62:29----------
do i think that


---------62:30----------
that there are teachers that are better


---------62:32----------
than that that know better than that yes


---------62:34----------
that these ones were just wrong and not


---------62:37----------
wrong about me but wrong with their


---------62:39----------
behaviors and how they handled their


---------62:41----------
authority


---------62:42----------
and so yes i ha


---------62:45----------
and the thing is i um


---------62:50----------
spend most of my time on twitch


---------62:53----------
so yes i would like for them to only hit


---------62:57----------
the ego


---------62:58----------
because they're never gonna get to the


---------63:00----------
inside like it's just not gonna i know


---------63:02----------
that you think that it's like a


---------63:04----------
great beautiful thing or whatever but on


---------63:06----------
twitch it's just not gonna happen


---------63:08----------
unless there's someone that i actually


---------63:10----------
care about what's not gonna happen


---------63:12----------
they're not gonna i'm not gonna step the


---------63:14----------
ego aside for people on twitch


---------63:18----------
yeah when you say it like that that


---------63:20----------
sounds like a good idea to me


---------63:22----------
yeah i just wanted to make that clear


---------63:25----------
like


---------63:26----------
i'm gonna i agree with you but like it


---------63:28----------
has to be someone i care about


---------63:30----------
for the ego to step aside not let me


---------63:32----------
just like about that because i i may


---------63:34----------
need to


---------63:35----------
rethink my approach it's a good point


---------63:49----------
because i think i think egos are the


---------63:51----------
best part of twitch


---------63:53----------
me too i love when someone has an ego


---------63:56----------
yeah i think it's hilarious


---------63:58----------
i something tells me that that


---------64:02----------
you know the best parts of your stream


---------64:03----------
are when you're like i will 1v1 you in


---------64:05----------
any game anytime anywhere and i will


---------64:07----------
[ __ ] all over your face


---------64:09----------
uh i mean some of us think it's funny


---------64:11----------
but i get a lot of hate for it so


---------64:13----------
whatever


---------64:14----------
i try not to do it because i know that


---------64:16----------
ultimately


---------64:17----------
it's like those things come from someone


---------64:19----------
getting me angry about the dumb [ __ ]


---------64:21----------
that they spew out of their mouths


---------64:23----------
and it just makes me look bad at risk


---------64:25----------
like oh my god i can't believe she


---------64:26----------
treats her child like that oh my [ __ ]


---------64:28----------
like no that's not my chat that's some


---------64:30----------
idiot that came in and shouted something


---------64:31----------
dumb like that


---------64:32----------
two different things but that's fine


---------64:40----------
so hmm


---------64:44----------
all right well let me take maybe just


---------64:46----------
maybe we can explore this just a little


---------64:47----------
bit further and if it doesn't get


---------64:49----------
anywhere because


---------64:49----------
you've really given me pause and and i


---------64:52----------
really have to rethink a lot of what i


---------64:54----------
was thinking earlier but


---------64:55----------
let's take kind of one more stab at it


---------64:56----------
if that's okay with you sure


---------64:59----------
so you were saying that the reason that


---------65:01----------
you had to develop that ego is because


---------65:03----------
it did sink in


---------65:04----------
and it did hurt back then yeah yes


---------65:08----------
right so there were dreams that i didn't


---------65:10----------
accomplish because i


---------65:11----------
i believed that i was a failure there


---------65:15----------
were things that i didn't even attempt


---------65:16----------
because i believed


---------65:17----------
that i was a failure


---------65:20----------
so why do you need the ego now


---------65:24----------
um it's just kind of for play


---------65:28----------
it's not real it's just for play it's


---------65:31----------
like


---------65:32----------
you know when i see somebody struggle so


---------65:34----------
hard to to attack


---------65:35----------
me or anything that i'm worth i'm just


---------65:37----------
like oh well here's my time to play


---------65:40----------
okay so i i can get behind that i'm


---------65:43----------
going to offer a hypothesis to you


---------65:45----------
and i'm curious what you think about it


---------65:47----------
so the hypothesis is that any time the


---------65:50----------
ego arises


---------65:51----------
it's because something does hurt that


---------65:54----------
the two


---------65:54----------
are interconnected so just like it arose


---------65:57----------
when you were a child to protect you


---------65:59----------
from the things that they said and the


---------66:00----------
hurt that they said


---------66:01----------
if it arises today it's because it's


---------66:04----------
still protecting something that's hurt


---------66:06----------
that's hurt


---------66:07----------
right but the thing is like i can get


---------66:10----------
over that hurt


---------66:12----------
i i at the end of the day i'll always


---------66:14----------
remind myself


---------66:15----------
who i am and what i'm capable of i've


---------66:17----------
worked very hard at that


---------66:19----------
so yes it'll hurt in the moment and it


---------66:21----------
will hurt a little


---------66:22----------
but i will find a way past that hurt


---------66:25----------
past those


---------66:26----------
um weaknesses i will evolve and and make


---------66:29----------
them better


---------66:30----------
right but the thing is so yes the ego


---------66:33----------
will come


---------66:34----------
out but that's because i i


---------66:37----------
recognize that attack it's like a laser


---------66:40----------
focus and like


---------66:41----------
this person is trying to attack like


---------66:44----------
and you know so that's yeah the ego


---------66:46----------
comes from a place because it's like why


---------66:48----------
are you trying to hurt me right now


---------66:49----------
what is your problem why are you trying


---------66:52----------
to hurt me what did i do


---------66:53----------
why is this happening


---------66:57----------
that makes a lot of sense


---------67:01----------
the ego is the one that asks why are you


---------67:03----------
trying to hurt me


---------67:04----------
no the real me but the ego goes the ego


---------67:08----------
is out there like


---------67:09----------
oh like well let's get into it like


---------67:12----------
let's play like i said earlier let's


---------67:13----------
play


---------67:14----------
let's play the game love it okay because


---------67:16----------
i was about to say because that that


---------67:18----------
other question doesn't sound like ego


---------67:20----------
like why are you trying to hurt me right


---------67:21----------
now that doesn't sound like ego at all


---------67:23----------
no that's the real me


---------67:24----------
that's a real me being upset like why


---------67:26----------
why are you trying to hurt me


---------67:28----------
like one thing that i i hate


---------67:31----------
is that hurt people hurt people


---------67:35----------
i wish it was not that way desperately


---------67:38----------
so i try not to hurt people with my


---------67:41----------
hurts


---------67:42----------
ever if i know that there is something


---------67:44----------
that hurts me or would hurt me


---------67:45----------
i don't like to say it to people that's


---------67:48----------
why i come up with something like i'd


---------67:49----------
[ __ ] your dad


---------67:50----------
because you know what my mom and my dad


---------67:52----------
have sex it makes me very happy so you


---------67:54----------
know what if someone's mad that their


---------67:56----------
dad's having sex that's weird you know


---------67:57----------
what i mean like just something like


---------67:59----------
it's just play it's just all


---------68:00----------
games like hey you oh do you think i'm


---------68:03----------
ugly well guess what i'll [ __ ] your dad


---------68:05----------
okay just shut your mouth


---------68:06----------
that's what i tell people like i don't


---------68:08----------
want to tell them like oh


---------68:09----------
you think i'm ugly like um i know what


---------68:12----------
you look like that big old forehead or


---------68:13----------
yours ain't doing no help


---------68:15----------
you know like something like that i i


---------68:17----------
don't enjoy that


---------68:19----------
you just lost me there i


---------68:22----------
i'm i'm very uh confusing it's okay


---------68:26----------
i acknowledge no i think you're actually


---------68:28----------
incredibly lucid i


---------68:29----------
i mean you just i i think that has more


---------68:32----------
to do with me than that stupid you


---------68:34----------
so the real me wants to know why


---------68:38----------
would you ever want to hurt someone the


---------68:40----------
way that you are hurt


---------68:41----------
the way that you've been hurt but the


---------68:44----------
ego will step


---------68:45----------
in because i'm on twitch or i don't have


---------68:48----------
[ __ ] time for this right now


---------68:50----------
you need to go deal with your own issues


---------68:52----------
so the ego will come out


---------68:53----------
and [ __ ] with you the way that you think


---------68:55----------
you're [ __ ] with me because you're


---------68:57----------
not [ __ ] with me


---------68:58----------
the only person who's gonna hurt later


---------68:59----------
on later is you


---------69:01----------
because i'll get over mine and if you


---------69:03----------
don't get over yours that's your own


---------69:04----------
problem


---------69:06----------
gotcha that makes a lot of sense man


---------69:15----------
do you feel like you're ahead or behind


---------69:18----------
still


---------69:20----------
um all the time i mean i live on twitch


---------69:23----------
so how could you not feel that you're


---------69:25----------
behind


---------69:26----------
i think every streamer feels like


---------69:27----------
they're behind they're behind on hours


---------69:29----------
they're behind on


---------69:30----------
minutes they're behind on this that like


---------69:32----------
always


---------69:33----------
what if i were to tell you that a header


---------69:35----------
behind is also


---------69:36----------
things that concept grows out of the ego


---------69:41----------
um well just to offer more information


---------69:45----------
i don't want to live in a head or behind


---------69:49----------
i i am tired of those concepts i


---------69:52----------
recognize that those have been an issue


---------69:54----------
for me


---------69:55----------
is to feel like oh i'm ahead i'm behind


---------69:57----------
them because because you're not always


---------69:58----------
ahead


---------70:00----------
like you're just not it's something that


---------70:02----------
happens like there's


---------70:04----------
always someone right i live in america


---------70:06----------
so there's always somebody


---------70:08----------
going ahead and a head and a head so i


---------70:10----------
hate living in the head and behind


---------70:12----------
and i've learned from um my beginning on


---------70:15----------
twitch just like five years ago


---------70:17----------
not to compare myself to others but to


---------70:19----------
not compare myself i need to stop living


---------70:22----------
in ahead and behind


---------70:23----------
so this is something very new for me but


---------70:26----------
it is something that i'm working at


---------70:28----------
just to let go of like okay that and


---------70:31----------
that


---------70:32----------
and just keep evolving and doing


---------70:35----------
what the best things for me are to do


---------70:37----------
and just focus on that


---------70:40----------
so adapt you seem very evolved to me


---------70:44----------
yeah and i think so too and um i


---------70:47----------
i think this is maybe the one thing


---------70:48----------
where the reason i keep on heart because


---------70:49----------
i don't think you're egotistical


---------70:51----------
i i hope you're not hearing that what


---------70:54----------
but i i do think that so ahead and


---------70:56----------
behind are concepts so


---------70:58----------
here are the functions of ego so ego


---------71:00----------
compares so anytime you compare yourself


---------71:03----------
to another person that is


---------71:04----------
a function of the ego this is not like


---------71:06----------
egotistical or being an [ __ ] or


---------71:08----------
anything like that it's like literally


---------71:10----------
the function of comparison happens in


---------71:13----------
the


---------71:14----------
part of your mind that is a hum god or


---------71:16----------
ego


---------71:17----------
okay so i think if you really want to be


---------71:20----------
a for


---------71:21----------
free from ahead or behind you need to be


---------71:24----------
free of your ego and i think you're


---------71:26----------
halfway there


---------71:27----------
it's just it's hard because i think you


---------71:29----------
sometimes i don't think you're quite in


---------71:32----------
in control of it as much as you're


---------71:35----------
suggesting so i


---------71:36----------
actually that's not true so i think i


---------71:38----------
would really bet money that there are


---------71:40----------
times where it gets away from you


---------71:42----------
which is true of all human beings so


---------71:44----------
it's like my ego yeah


---------71:46----------
okay so i i i think that i think that


---------71:48----------
there's still so you call yourself adapt


---------71:50----------
to the best and so i think that there's


---------71:52----------
still like


---------71:53----------
a part of you that you know if you


---------71:55----------
really think about it like that's a name


---------71:56----------
that belies confidence but if you're


---------71:58----------
really confident you don't need to call


---------72:00----------
yourself the best


---------72:02----------
right right so i i think that that this


---------72:04----------
is where


---------72:05----------
where it's bizarre because i think i see


---------72:07----------
these things happening in parallel i


---------72:09----------
don't think you're insecure i think


---------72:10----------
you're actually


---------72:11----------
remarkably secure and this ego still


---------72:14----------
persists and all of this ahead and


---------72:16----------
behind thinking


---------72:18----------
moves you away from your true self and


---------72:20----------
actually feeds the ego


---------72:22----------
and the more that the ego is there the


---------72:23----------
more the ahead and behind is there


---------72:25----------
it looks like you've got something to


---------72:26----------
say go for it because i


---------72:28----------
live my life on twitch i don't live


---------72:31----------
anywhere else as crazy as that sounds


---------72:34----------
just in this moment in time


---------72:36----------
i lived my whole life on twitch the name


---------72:38----------
was never supposed to be confidence


---------72:40----------
the name was always ego so the name will


---------72:42----------
always be ego


---------72:44----------
and the persona will always be ego but


---------72:46----------
it's not who i really


---------72:48----------
really am to my core i can believe those


---------72:51----------
things


---------72:51----------
in a secure way in a confident way and i


---------72:54----------
do


---------72:54----------
but the ego is what will come out


---------72:57----------
and get out get out of control


---------73:00----------
you know when i'm into it in bad


---------73:03----------
circumstances or whatever this or that


---------73:05----------
but because i live on twit i don't


---------73:08----------
interact with many people


---------73:10----------
in real life i don't i just how do you


---------73:13----------
really interact with people


---------73:15----------
i don't care i love it i i


---------73:18----------
i interact with my parents i interact


---------73:20----------
with my family but my family does not


---------73:22----------
try


---------73:23----------
to attack me or or you know down


---------73:27----------
like belittle me they don't try those


---------73:29----------
things so


---------73:30----------
i mean i don't know i have felix felix


---------73:33----------
lives here he talks to me every day he


---------73:36----------
doesn't try to put me down


---------73:37----------
or attack me or or belittle me and


---------73:41----------
he understands the twitch world he


---------73:42----------
understands my lifestyle


---------73:45----------
so and i have a couple friends uh


---------73:48----------
xqc oh okay we lived together um


---------73:52----------
for about three three years


---------73:55----------
and um so


---------73:58----------
i have friends in real life like melina


---------74:01----------
has become one of my real life friends


---------74:03----------
and i have friends from high school i


---------74:05----------
have two but one of them i just don't


---------74:08----------
talk to anymore


---------74:09----------
and the other one i'm starting not to


---------74:11----------
talk to anymore and that has a lot to do


---------74:13----------
with because our schedules don't add up


---------74:15----------
our lifestyles don't add up um just


---------74:18----------
they're into some bad behaviors that i


---------74:21----------
don't feel comfortable talking about on


---------74:22----------
stream


---------74:23----------
and i'm okay with distancing myself from


---------74:26----------
those people even though they meant a


---------74:27----------
lot to me in my past


---------74:29----------
and they are my best friends um


---------74:32----------
and like i i see them and i talk to them


---------74:35----------
and i hang out


---------74:36----------
but they're not trying they're like i


---------74:39----------
don't interact with humans i don't go to


---------74:41----------
work and deal with people that i don't


---------74:42----------
like


---------74:43----------
even at the grocery store i don't


---------74:45----------
interact with people i


---------74:46----------
here's your card here's your bags


---------74:48----------
goodbye like that's it


---------74:49----------
like i don't know i'm i don't mind it i


---------74:52----------
don't


---------74:53----------
see anything i think it's a fun


---------74:55----------
enjoyable thing


---------74:56----------
um i wish that there were things i could


---------74:59----------
do


---------75:00----------
that would put me in interaction with


---------75:02----------
more people like i wish i could go


---------75:04----------
play like local softball or local


---------75:08----------
um community college but with


---------75:10----------
coronavirus right now i just can't


---------75:13----------
but um i do kind of wish that i could do


---------75:16----------
that but i know that i'll do it in time


---------75:18----------
so it's fine


---------75:23----------
yeah i i think uh adapt is there


---------75:24----------
anything i can help you with


---------75:28----------
uh yes but nothing that i


---------75:31----------
feel comfortable talking on stream


---------75:33----------
that's for sure


---------75:34----------
okay because because it's interesting


---------75:36----------
because i i mean i appreciate the story


---------75:38----------
that you're telling but i find myself


---------75:40----------
sort of


---------75:41----------
digging like like the reason i started


---------75:43----------
talking about the ego and stuff is


---------75:44----------
because i feel like there's something


---------75:45----------
like i don't


---------75:46----------
understand you know what the problem is


---------75:54----------
i know i know so because that's that's


---------75:55----------
the best i could come up with


---------75:58----------
yeah um i mean


---------76:01----------
your people reached out and they were


---------76:02----------
like hey do you want to come on dr k


---------76:04----------
and i was like oh putting all my mental


---------76:06----------
issues out into the world and i was like


---------76:08----------
no like i don't want to you know do that


---------76:11----------
that's what they're like


---------76:12----------
so i was like the only thing that i'd


---------76:14----------
really care to talk about on stream


---------76:16----------
would be


---------76:17----------
um you know like sharing my


---------76:20----------
it was just kind of sharing an


---------76:22----------
experience and openly discussing it with


---------76:24----------
you but it wasn't necessarily seeking


---------76:26----------
help


---------76:26----------
for anything regarding those things i


---------76:28----------
get that and that's totally fine


---------76:30----------
um it's just i i figured like you know


---------76:32----------
at this point in the conversation


---------76:35----------
having talked to you for a while i sort


---------76:36----------
of went down the ego road just to


---------76:38----------
because like i said i don't think you've


---------76:40----------
got a problem with it it was just


---------76:41----------
because i think it's like you're a


---------76:42----------
really good example of someone


---------76:45----------
who has confidence and ego and the way


---------76:48----------
that you talk about it makes perfect


---------76:50----------
sense like i think very few people


---------76:51----------
understand when you say


---------76:52----------
adept the best is ego that's not me like


---------76:55----------
that makes perfect sense


---------76:57----------
right so so you're someone who's really


---------76:58----------
understood that like


---------77:00----------
there's a difference between the self


---------77:02----------
and the ego and the ego is like a


---------77:04----------
program that like you turn on your


---------77:06----------
computer and then it does particular


---------77:07----------
things


---------77:08----------
and then you can like turn it off um it


---------77:11----------
also makes perfect sense to me that like


---------77:13----------
you know the ego you make a really


---------77:15----------
strong argument for the ego being like


---------77:17----------
a necessary part of twitch which frankly


---------77:20----------
it's a necessary part of life


---------77:22----------
so like if you really have no ego like


---------77:24----------
you suck at the game of life


---------77:26----------
because you won't advocate for a


---------77:27----------
promotion you won't advocate for


---------77:30----------
you know all kinds of things to like


---------77:31----------
advance your worldly life


---------77:34----------
um you know i i do think that a lot of


---------77:38----------
the real place to grow i think for you


---------77:40----------
is just that


---------77:41----------
to recognize like if i could give you


---------77:42----------
one bit of information we don't have to


---------77:44----------
get more into it


---------77:45----------
but just this ahead and behind thing


---------77:47----------
just so you understand it's part of


---------77:49----------
ego so so that if you really want to be


---------77:52----------
free


---------77:53----------
from sort of like the shackles


---------77:56----------
of ahead and behind ego dissolution


---------78:00----------
techniques or further protect uh


---------78:02----------
restraining the ego is going to be like


---------78:04----------
how you free yourself from that


---------78:07----------
but you figured out most of it on your


---------78:08----------
own like that


---------78:10----------
you go is comparison and things like


---------78:11----------
that for me


---------78:13----------
my worry would be how do i live without


---------78:16----------
a head and behind like


---------78:17----------
how do i stay focused


---------78:21----------
you know what i mean yep yeah that that


---------78:24----------
would be my worry


---------78:25----------
when it comes to losing this thing so so


---------78:27----------
this is where


---------78:28----------
your worry is good um because


---------78:33----------
in a sense like there's actually like


---------78:35----------
some evidence to suggest that


---------78:37----------
if you lost a head and behind you would


---------78:40----------
fail


---------78:41----------
you just wouldn't care because yeah like


---------78:44----------
i could easily just sit


---------78:45----------
in the couch lay in bed all day and just


---------78:48----------
eat garbage and not do anything not go


---------78:50----------
to work not stream


---------78:51----------
not do it like [ __ ] all the i could


---------78:53----------
easily do that


---------78:54----------
but but that's it's not quite the same


---------78:56----------
so like can i tell you a quick story


---------78:58----------
yes so this is one of my favorite


---------79:00----------
stories about buddha


---------79:01----------
so buddha so you know buddha was a


---------79:04----------
prince


---------79:05----------
and um like what happened so buddha's


---------79:08----------
story kind of starts out so


---------79:09----------
he's like a prince and he's like loved


---------79:11----------
and respected and all this good stuff


---------79:13----------
and when he was born um there was an


---------79:16----------
astrologer that came and told his dad


---------79:18----------
the king he said okay your son is either


---------79:20----------
gonna be


---------79:22----------
one of the best kings that the world has


---------79:23----------
ever seen or he's going to be one of the


---------79:25----------
best


---------79:26----------
like monks or priests or you know holy


---------79:29----------
men


---------79:29----------
that the world has ever seen and so as


---------79:31----------
king is like well his dad is like well


---------79:33----------
[ __ ] that i don't want him to be like


---------79:34----------
some holy man like i want him to be like


---------79:36----------
a king you know because he's my son and


---------79:38----------
that's his job


---------79:39----------
so what he does is he tries to protect


---------79:41----------
his son from like all the things like


---------79:43----------
all the negativity in the world


---------79:45----------
um so he sort of uh you know doesn't


---------79:48----------
expose


---------79:49----------
buddha to any anyone who's sick anyone


---------79:52----------
who's old or anyone who's dead


---------79:55----------
and one day buddha sneaks out of the


---------79:57----------
palace and he kind of


---------79:59----------
sees he's like walking around and then


---------80:01----------
he sees like someone who's like


---------80:04----------
old and then he's kind of like he's he's


---------80:06----------
with his bodyguard


---------80:07----------
and so he's like what the f what's up


---------80:08----------
with that guy that guy's like his face


---------80:10----------
is all funny looking and his hair is a


---------80:11----------
different color


---------80:12----------
and then his bodyguard is like oh that


---------80:14----------
dude's old and buddha's like


---------80:16----------
what does that mean old what does that


---------80:17----------
word mean they're like oh like this is


---------80:19----------
what happens to people as they like you


---------80:21----------
know and so explain


---------80:22----------
the words like what what the [ __ ] this


---------80:24----------
is crazy


---------80:25----------
you know yeah sounds like a bug not a


---------80:28----------
feature


---------80:29----------
and and then he kind of goes on he sees


---------80:30----------
someone who's sick and he's like what


---------80:32----------
the hell is wrong with that guy he's


---------80:33----------
like making this weird no


---------80:34----------
like there's stuff coming out of his


---------80:35----------
nose and like he's making this weird


---------80:37----------
noise and


---------80:39----------
and then they're like oh he's sick and


---------80:40----------
he's like well there's like what's that


---------80:42----------
right and then he sees someone who's


---------80:43----------
dead he's like what the [ __ ] is wrong


---------80:44----------
with that guy that guy's not even moving


---------80:46----------
and he smells bad and then his body


---------80:49----------
guards like oh that dude's dead and


---------80:50----------
buddha's like what is what is that


---------80:52----------
and so then buddha goes back and he's


---------80:54----------
like oh [ __ ] i didn't realize and then


---------80:56----------
he's like really has this crisis


---------80:58----------
and he's like i don't know what is going


---------81:00----------
on here


---------81:01----------
and he's unhappy so he decides that he's


---------81:03----------
gonna leave and then his dad is like


---------81:05----------
[ __ ]


---------81:05----------
and the very thing that he tried to


---------81:06----------
prevent he ended up sort of creating


---------81:09----------
and then buddha travels around for a


---------81:10----------
long time and he kind of abandons this


---------81:13----------
like worldly life because he's like this


---------81:14----------
doesn't make any sense


---------81:16----------
and he goes and he's seeks for light and


---------81:18----------
he becomes enlightened


---------81:19----------
then many years then what he does is he


---------81:21----------
travels around india like a poor person


---------81:22----------
so he's like you know sitting on his


---------81:24----------
couch all day he just kind of wanders


---------81:25----------
around he has no possessions or anything


---------81:26----------
like that


---------81:27----------
he like teaches people ask him for help


---------81:29----------
he like helps when he can


---------81:30----------
but he's kind of just chilling right


---------81:32----------
he's just vibing


---------81:34----------
and then one day he goes back to his old


---------81:35----------
capital city because he's just make


---------81:37----------
touring around india and he's walking


---------81:38----------
down the street and who he sees


---------81:41----------
is his ex-wife and his son


---------81:45----------
and and then you know they they lock


---------81:47----------
eyes and the ex-wife is like


---------81:49----------
[ __ ] you you know how dare you


---------81:53----------
you abandoned me and you abandoned your


---------81:55----------
son and she's like i can


---------81:57----------
i can handle that you abandoned me i've


---------81:59----------
gotten over it i'm a strong woman


---------82:01----------
much like yourself adept and she says i


---------82:03----------
can i can handle it for myself but like


---------82:05----------
you really let your son down and it's a


---------82:06----------
father's responsibility


---------82:09----------
to take care of their son because he had


---------82:11----------
sort of failed his duties as a


---------82:12----------
consequence of his enlightenment so


---------82:14----------
you're totally right


---------82:15----------
that like that's what happens and so


---------82:17----------
then buddha says you know what you're


---------82:18----------
right that


---------82:19----------
it's like even as an enlightened person


---------82:21----------
like i still have


---------82:22----------
duties and that that you're correct that


---------82:26----------
i've abandoned you even though i don't


---------82:27----------
have ambition


---------82:28----------
i still have duties and so he says to


---------82:31----------
his wife he's like you know i'm gonna


---------82:33----------
fix that right now so you say that it's


---------82:34----------
a father's


---------82:35----------
responsibility to give their son the


---------82:38----------
best of what they have and like pass


---------82:40----------
along their inheritance


---------82:42----------
and so let me fix that right now like


---------82:44----------
his son's like 13 14 at the time so he's


---------82:46----------
like why don't you let him come with me


---------82:48----------
and then he holds up his bagging bowl


---------82:50----------
and he's like i'll give him my


---------82:51----------
inheritance


---------82:52----------
this is what he has and i'll teach him


---------82:54----------
how to be a broke


---------82:55----------
monk and we'll travel together and then


---------82:58----------
his wife is like [ __ ] you never


---------83:00----------
yeah you can take your begging bowl and


---------83:02----------
go so you're you're actually kind of


---------83:04----------
right


---------83:04----------
that like you know in a sense it can be


---------83:08----------
hard


---------83:08----------
to lose your ego any thoughts about the


---------83:11----------
story by the way or


---------83:12----------
should i just keep going i would love if


---------83:14----------
you kept going


---------83:15----------
okay i mean i mean the story i


---------83:19----------
i understand i get it my only thought


---------83:22----------
is like well yeah but then you know he


---------83:24----------
didn't pay his bills either he didn't do


---------83:26----------
it absolutely


---------83:27----------
you're damn right and that's what the


---------83:29----------
story i mean your concern is spot on


---------83:31----------
because that's what


---------83:31----------
like but literally he didn't pay his


---------83:33----------
bills he's just like up and left right


---------83:35----------
no alimony no child support you know it


---------83:38----------
turned out okay because his


---------83:39----------
you know his wife happened to be a queen


---------83:41----------
you know and and that doesn't stress me


---------83:43----------
out less is what


---------83:44----------
it stresses me out more yeah because


---------83:47----------
this is what i'm trying to tell you is


---------83:48----------
that your instincts are not wrong


---------83:50----------
your instincts are right and that's your


---------83:52----------
[ __ ] problem you figured all this


---------83:54----------
[ __ ] out on your own


---------83:56----------
yeah right that ego is comparison and


---------83:58----------
ahead and behind is comparison and


---------84:00----------
absolutely


---------84:01----------
and so you should be worried it turns


---------84:03----------
out that there is a way


---------84:05----------
and that's to think a little bit so let


---------84:06----------
me tell you let me ask you this


---------84:09----------
so your performance with these these


---------84:11----------
kids in their basketball league


---------84:12----------
right yeah was ego involved there at all


---------84:17----------
uh yeah with the other coaches because


---------84:19----------
they like one of the coaches


---------84:21----------
he would do some very weird stuff like


---------84:23----------
he ended up getting


---------84:24----------
this is just like a local girl city


---------84:28----------
league and he was getting like four


---------84:30----------
girls from his travel ball team


---------84:32----------
and i was like listen dude and i told


---------84:34----------
him i was like i don't know why you're


---------84:35----------
doing that we're still gonna beat you


---------84:37----------
and we did we did feed him and so i was


---------84:39----------
like okay


---------84:40----------
like good luck i guess but um so yeah


---------84:43----------
ego came


---------84:44----------
out there with the other coaches but not


---------84:45----------
with my girls yeah


---------84:47----------
and so let me ask you something like did


---------84:49----------
you


---------84:50----------
succeed or fail with your girls we we


---------84:53----------
succeeded we won the championship


---------84:55----------
like more than not and when we didn't we


---------84:57----------
were in second place so


---------84:59----------
yeah so so but how did you attain that


---------85:01----------
success without ego


---------85:06----------
well it's their success it may have been


---------85:09----------
my it was


---------85:09----------
me teaching them and helping them and


---------85:12----------
guiding them but it was their success


---------85:14----------
it's not my success yeah so that's


---------85:16----------
beautifully put


---------85:17----------
and that's the answer right so like like


---------85:20----------
this is where


---------85:21----------
when you do something out of service you


---------85:24----------
can


---------85:25----------
still have success it's good that you


---------85:27----------
note that it's not your success so


---------85:29----------
people look at healthy game and they're


---------85:30----------
like dr k is successful


---------85:32----------
i don't really think so it's not my


---------85:34----------
success this is a big thing that no one


---------85:35----------
understands right it's it's like so so


---------85:38----------
this is where


---------85:39----------
if ambition is of the ego and if you're


---------85:42----------
worried about not being able to pay your


---------85:44----------
bills


---------85:46----------
if you lose your ambition and you lose


---------85:47----------
your ego the answer is like that's a


---------85:50----------
valid concern


---------85:51----------
and you can still sort of be successful


---------85:53----------
in a sense which is just


---------85:55----------
through something called like it's


---------85:56----------
through service


---------85:58----------
right so like like when when you when


---------86:00----------
you set the goal is not being


---------86:02----------
successful but you're saying hey there


---------86:04----------
are these girls and i want to teach them


---------86:06----------
confidence


---------86:07----------
i want to teach them that they have


---------86:08----------
value i want to show them that they can


---------86:10----------
do anything that they put their mind to


---------86:12----------
when that is your compass you will be


---------86:13----------
able to pay your bills


---------86:15----------
yeah that's good i'm happy i feel like


---------86:18----------
uh


---------86:19----------
i feel like i'm on the right path it's


---------86:21----------
just like a reassurance like


---------86:23----------
yeah and that's true so you can let go


---------86:25----------
this is where it's scary


---------86:27----------
because i thinking about ahead and


---------86:29----------
behind is


---------86:30----------
how is the playbook you've been using to


---------86:33----------
become successful on twitch


---------86:35----------
and it can be scary to let go of a


---------86:37----------
hidden behind


---------86:38----------
but what i'm telling you is that ahead


---------86:40----------
and behind causes psychological torture


---------86:42----------
and may lead to success


---------86:44----------
and it is my belief that you can try to


---------86:47----------
make the world a better place


---------86:49----------
and let go of success and you'll be


---------86:50----------
successful anyway


---------86:53----------
i feel like to to an extent


---------86:56----------
my biggest successes and the moments i'm


---------86:58----------
most proud of come from a place that


---------87:00----------
knows that


---------87:01----------
yeah because i like i said i i do


---------87:05----------
talk to people a lot i share a lot of


---------87:07----------
insight i share


---------87:08----------
my struggles and how i overcame them and


---------87:10----------
those were my great successes and


---------87:13----------
that's what i try to focus more on like


---------87:16----------
my


---------87:16----------
ahead and behind comes from myself not


---------87:18----------
like yes other streamers sometimes


---------87:21----------
but i try to stifle that when i notice


---------87:23----------
it happening but mostly myself


---------87:25----------
yeah yeah i think that's that's so i


---------87:28----------
think like i said i think you've figured


---------87:29----------
most of the stuff out on your it's quite


---------87:31----------
amazing


---------87:32----------
thank you you know for what it's worth


---------87:34----------
if you ever wanted to learn formal


---------87:35----------
spiritual practice i think


---------87:37----------
actually let me think about this


---------87:43----------
yeah i was going to say i think you'd be


---------87:44----------
good at it but i'm not so sure


---------87:48----------
i i i i i know this sounds weird but


---------87:52----------
but actually i think that you i don't


---------87:55----------
know if you should learn from someone


---------87:58----------
is what i mean i i think right you're


---------88:00----------
doing a good job of learning from


---------88:01----------
yourself


---------88:02----------
if anything it could be hard to learn


---------88:04----------
from someone i've


---------88:05----------
learned from everyone i've


---------88:08----------
learned from many many sources that i


---------88:11----------
could think of like at any given time i


---------88:13----------
know who taught me what and when


---------88:15----------
um but with what you mentioned i


---------88:19----------
actually got


---------88:20----------
um a meditative meditation singing bowl


---------88:22----------
i think they call it


---------88:24----------
i got it yesterday and i used it and it


---------88:26----------
was really nice


---------88:27----------
it's one of my new favorite things up on


---------88:30----------
the top right


---------88:31----------
i think i just figured out what we're


---------88:33----------
going to do do you want to learn some


---------88:34----------
meditation today


---------88:36----------
sure okay yeah any any like closing


---------88:39----------
thoughts or questions i mean


---------88:40----------
i i feel like you know i loved hearing


---------88:42----------
your story i don't really have much else


---------88:44----------
to say


---------88:45----------
no that i'm i'm happy to share it and


---------88:49----------
i feel i just you know i i think it's


---------88:52----------
important to share all of our stories


---------88:53----------
and i think it's meaningful and


---------88:55----------
and i hope that i didn't come on here


---------88:57----------
with the guys of you thinking you're


---------88:59----------
going to help me


---------89:00----------
um yes i'm always open to help but i i


---------89:03----------
didn't mean to like


---------89:04----------
mislead you i told them what i wanted to


---------89:06----------
talk about so


---------89:07----------
i don't feel misled it's hard to be


---------89:10----------
misled when you have no expectations


---------89:13----------
cool um you know for what it's worth


---------89:16----------
adapt uh


---------89:17----------
you're partnered with twitch so


---------89:20----------
um you know if you do have things that


---------89:22----------
you want to talk about more privately


---------89:24----------
first of all good good for you for


---------89:26----------
setting up an evaluation or like meeting


---------89:28----------
a psychologist or therapist


---------89:29----------
you know that's a really good place to


---------89:31----------
talk about things with you don't have to


---------89:32----------
talk about stuff on stream for sure


---------89:35----------
we just actually so twitch is actually


---------89:37----------
sponsoring our creator coaching


---------89:39----------
uh program so i think three years ago


---------89:42----------
i think twitch twitch creators


---------89:45----------
twitch asked like their content creators


---------89:47----------
what can we do for you


---------89:50----------
and the two things that that the


---------89:52----------
creators


---------89:53----------
they said three things one is that we


---------89:55----------
need to figure out how to pay taxes


---------89:57----------
and such which was like okay and then


---------89:59----------
the second thing was i think some people


---------90:00----------
wanted some training in like stage


---------90:02----------
presence or like more formal you're


---------90:04----------
smiling is this


---------90:06----------
no i love it taxes it's a big meme in


---------90:09----------
our household


---------90:10----------
taxes we never escape them and then and


---------90:13----------
then the third thing that they asked for


---------90:14----------
was mental health support but


---------90:16----------
it seems like it was hard for people to


---------90:18----------
you know twitch sort of set up this


---------90:20----------
thing where you guys can get


---------90:21----------
you have discounts with like talk space


---------90:23----------
or better help or something and then


---------90:26----------
they give you guys like access to


---------90:27----------
certain apps and whatnot but thankfully


---------90:29----------
um


---------90:30----------
they've decided to actually try to


---------90:31----------
support their content creators so you


---------90:33----------
can sign up for that program it's


---------90:34----------
it's private um yeah and and stuff like


---------90:37----------
that so you can give that a shot


---------90:39----------
if you want to sure i would love that um


---------90:43----------
and then uh yeah so you can you know


---------90:45----------
check that out and


---------90:48----------
you know it seems to be going pretty


---------90:49----------
well they sort of help a lot so we deal


---------90:51----------
with things like imposter syndrome and


---------90:52----------
burnout


---------90:53----------
and and those kinds of things um but you


---------90:57----------
can always try that but i think


---------90:58----------
it's good that you're seeing a


---------90:59----------
psychologist i'd be really curious


---------91:01----------
whether


---------91:01----------
you know they end up diagnosing you with


---------91:02----------
something or not i'll let you know


---------91:05----------
if they do you don't have to but i'm


---------91:08----------
just saying it's


---------91:08----------
no i would love to share that with you


---------91:10----------
i'm so curious about you know these


---------91:12----------
stories like yours where you're like


---------91:14----------
gifted but failing like


---------91:16----------
i don't know what that is


---------91:19----------
i don't i don't know if that's just it


---------91:21----------
that can really be explained by a


---------91:22----------
diagnosis or if there's like more to it


---------91:25----------
um and and so


---------91:28----------
because i think there are a lot of


---------91:29----------
people out there i'm glad you shared


---------91:30----------
that story because


---------91:32----------
uh you know my story is actually


---------91:34----------
somewhat similar i sort of lucked out in


---------91:35----------
the sense that they actually had me skip


---------91:37----------
a grade


---------91:38----------
so so i actually like you know didn't


---------91:41----------
have to sit around and repeat stuff


---------91:43----------
right um but then i had my own


---------91:47----------
fair share of problems i think


---------91:50----------
to put it simply and and it's been said


---------91:53----------
time and time again


---------91:54----------
public school is just not for every


---------91:57----------
student


---------91:58----------
and and no offense but especially gifted


---------92:01----------
students


---------92:01----------
it's just not um as much as we would


---------92:04----------
love it to be


---------92:05----------
as much as it's a great thing because


---------92:06----------
it's free and


---------92:08----------
accessible for like literally everyone


---------92:10----------
in america i don't want to get into


---------92:11----------
politics but


---------92:13----------
um you know it it is a great thing i'm


---------92:16----------
not going to say that it's not but it's


---------92:18----------
definitely not for every student


---------92:20----------
and yeah my my meaning


---------92:23----------
for sharing this story with you guys


---------92:25----------
today is just any students out there


---------92:27----------
like


---------92:28----------
you're not a failure you're gonna be


---------92:30----------
okay like find your path


---------92:33----------
build yourself up and just find a way


---------92:36----------
there are options you can test out of


---------92:38----------
high school


---------92:38----------
you can go to continuation school you


---------92:40----------
can go to ged you can do all the above


---------92:42----------
like i almost did


---------92:43----------
so that's my point with sharing my story


---------92:46----------
today


---------92:48----------
you know what i really love about that


---------92:50----------
last sentence adapt is you can do all


---------92:51----------
these things like i almost did


---------92:54----------
i think that is a sign of confidence


---------92:57----------
yeah right to say that yeah


---------93:00----------
you know i i don't know if you still


---------93:03----------
have i'm detecting some emotional maybe


---------93:05----------
i struck a nerve there but


---------93:07----------
you know i i think it's like it's it's


---------93:09----------
really awesome to see you


---------93:11----------
own what you can be proud of and also


---------93:14----------
own what you don't have to be proud of


---------93:16----------
and that you can actually be okay with


---------93:18----------
that


---------93:20----------
mm-hmm


---------93:23----------
yeah cool okay


---------93:26----------
so meditation since you got a singing


---------93:29----------
bowl


---------93:30----------
i have to turn my camera off though if


---------93:32----------
you want me to go get it


---------93:34----------
okay okay we are back


---------93:38----------
well did you not want me to get it i


---------93:40----------
thought you wanted me to go don't mind


---------93:41----------
go


---------93:42----------
go get it okay


---------93:45----------
i just find myself being curious why you


---------93:46----------
have to turn are you like not wearing


---------93:48----------
pants or something no because i have a


---------93:50----------
lot of coomers that will zoom in on my


---------93:52----------
butt crack and


---------93:53----------
it's like i have i have basketball


---------93:56----------
shorts on but they'll still find a way


---------93:58----------
to sexually exploit me and it's very


---------94:00----------
so i just should i should i be worried


---------94:04----------
about that


---------94:05----------
probably no one's safe


---------94:12----------
i'm gonna risk it


---------94:15----------
no okay no i won't


---------94:22----------
what what exactly is a coomer again


---------94:26----------
um well these are like these are beyond


---------94:29----------
coomers like these people have no


---------94:32----------
they're just dude how the [ __ ] do we get


---------94:35----------
a beyond


---------94:36----------
cover to come on stream can we do that


---------94:40----------
oh my god just literally google my name


---------94:43----------
i swear to god


---------94:44----------
it's crazy out here you'll find them


---------94:47----------
no no but i'm i'm serious i want to talk


---------94:50----------
because like i want to talk to these


---------94:51----------
people and


---------94:52----------
i think that's a great no i'm serious i


---------94:54----------
am serious too i think that's a great


---------94:55----------
idea because


---------94:56----------
i would love to understand why they do


---------94:58----------
what they do because there are


---------95:00----------
millions and millions of places where


---------95:01----------
they can you know look at women that are


---------95:04----------
sexually


---------95:05----------
uh you know exploiting i don't know i'm


---------95:08----------
not trying to be insensitive


---------95:09----------
i this just how you know like sexually


---------95:13----------
displaying themselves all the time it's


---------95:16----------
a great thing


---------95:17----------
i love it i look at it so why do they


---------95:19----------
need to put me on sexual display when


---------95:21----------
i'm not sexually displaying myself


---------95:24----------
that's something that whole other door


---------95:27----------
you're opening here


---------95:31----------
i love opening doors at the end of the


---------95:33----------
interview


---------95:35----------
um but like though literally can you


---------95:37----------
explain to me what a coomer is


---------95:40----------
um okay so coomer is literally


---------95:44----------
not gonna explain it in words other than


---------95:46----------
lingo


---------95:48----------
see this is why i'm confused because


---------95:49----------
like i you know they're all these terms


---------95:51----------
and i can sort of piece things together


---------95:54----------
but the best that i could come up with


---------95:56----------
is that


---------95:57----------
there's something involving sexuality


---------95:59----------
and it's a boomer that's replaced


---------96:01----------
with a b with a c yes


---------96:04----------
but don't use the term boomer litter


---------96:06----------
cause it


---------96:07----------
it's just a coomer like [ __ ]


---------96:11----------
coomer cooming it's just like someone


---------96:14----------
that's


---------96:14----------
very horny and does horny [ __ ] or is


---------96:17----------
horny on main


---------96:18----------
i guess on main what does that mean yeah


---------96:21----------
like like on their main accounts like


---------96:24----------
they're out here on the twitter and


---------96:25----------
they're


---------96:26----------
like just just putting their horniness


---------96:28----------
out there for the world to see how horny


---------96:30----------
they are


---------96:31----------
instead of going and jerking off and


---------96:32----------
using the internet when they're of clear


---------96:34----------
mind like a normal person like


---------96:37----------
i think ludwig explains it well in one


---------96:39----------
of his clips that they could link you


---------96:42----------
okay i gotta i gotta watch this and get


---------96:44----------
educated


---------96:45----------
but i really i mean if you know


---------96:49----------
i would like to i would like to speak to


---------96:51----------
one of these mythical figures


---------96:52----------
i would love if you did that it would


---------96:55----------
offer me


---------96:56----------
so much i love to understand why people


---------96:58----------
do what they do


---------97:00----------
and i would love to understand why they


---------97:02----------
make


---------97:03----------
fake naked pictures of me and share them


---------97:06----------
amongst each other


---------97:07----------
when in reality like i i think i'm


---------97:10----------
i post sexy pictures like why do you


---------97:12----------
have to take it to the next level i


---------97:14----------
don't get it do you know what


---------97:15----------
does that make sense a little which one


---------97:20----------
all of it all of it dr k


---------97:24----------
stop trying to have me narrow things


---------97:26----------
down i mean this way


---------97:28----------
i i i think the disturbing thing is that


---------97:31----------
you know i think a lot of it makes sense


---------97:35----------
i just want to know why they do that i


---------97:38----------
just don't get it


---------97:39----------
well i mean just i'm wondering if i'm a


---------97:41----------
coomer now but


---------97:42----------
um you know because if you say if you


---------97:45----------
say you post sexy pictures of yourself


---------97:48----------
and why are people photoshopping things


---------97:50----------
probably because the pictures that you


---------97:51----------
post aren't enough


---------97:53----------
okay for their humor minds is what


---------97:57----------
you're


---------97:58----------
saying exactly okay okay that makes


---------98:00----------
sense i mean so generally


---------98:02----------
when people you know change things about


---------98:04----------
the world like why do they change things


---------98:06----------
about the world it's because the world


---------98:07----------
doesn't give them what they want


---------98:10----------
right but the thing is the more that


---------98:13----------
they do these weird fake things


---------98:15----------
the more that it makes me not want to do


---------98:17----------
it for real


---------98:19----------
because it's like okay well they're just


---------98:21----------
being weird with it so i'm definitely


---------98:23----------
never gonna do that


---------98:26----------
i think you just opened a whole can of


---------98:28----------
worms because i don't know what they


---------98:29----------
know you did


---------98:30----------
no you open the doors stop projecting


---------98:36----------
you opened the can of worms no you


---------98:38----------
you're the coomer you're the cooper


---------98:40----------
you it's you


---------98:43----------
yeah i don't know but i think you know


---------98:45----------
we'll we'll learn so we're here to learn


---------98:46----------
about the internet


---------98:47----------
and learn about the minds of the people


---------98:49----------
on the internet


---------98:50----------
so maybe that'll happen let's get to


---------98:52----------
meditation and pure things


---------98:54----------
let's do that okay so um


---------98:57----------
you have your singing bowl so i'm gonna


---------99:01----------
teach you


---------99:02----------
um kind of an introductory practice


---------99:05----------
and then like sort of a second practice


---------99:07----------
okay okay so i don't know


---------99:08----------
uh what's gonna get transmitted over


---------99:10----------
discord but if you ring your singing


---------99:12----------
bowl


---------99:12----------
you're going to hear that there's an


---------99:14----------
oscillation or a fluctuation in the


---------99:17----------
sound it's not going to be one note


---------99:19----------
okay okay okay and so


---------99:23----------
okay yeah what i want you to kind of do


---------99:26----------
i'm going to go ahead and ring it i


---------99:27----------
don't know what you're going to be able


---------99:28----------
to hear


---------99:28----------
but you can try ringing it on your end


---------99:32----------
and then what i want you to listen to is


---------99:33----------
the fluctuations of the sound and try to


---------99:36----------
hear


---------99:36----------
as long as you can because the


---------99:38----------
fluctuations are going to get lower and


---------99:39----------
lower and lower


---------99:41----------
okay all right yeah so on three


---------99:45----------
one two three


---------99:57----------
got it i did mine very lightly i was


---------100:00----------
scared


---------100:01----------
okay have no fear okay


---------100:04----------
be brave adapt all right okay once again


---------100:20----------
louder


---------100:22----------
huh am i supposed to close my eyes i saw


---------100:25----------

---------100:25----------

---------100:27----------
i i didn't tell you okay so no you


---------100:29----------

---------100:33----------
one who's a good teacher i'm a shitty


---------100:34----------
teacher


---------100:35----------
okay ready one more time eyes closed


---------100:38----------
[Music]


---------100:48----------
okay


---------100:50----------
okay so now what i want you to do


---------100:53----------
is ring it three times in a row with


---------100:56----------
your eyes closed


---------100:58----------
wait until the silence really settles


---------101:00----------
then ring it a second time


---------101:02----------
wait till the silence settles then ring


---------101:03----------
it a third time


---------101:05----------
and then keep your eyes closed for about


---------101:07----------
60 seconds after and then i'll teach you


---------101:09----------
the second phase of the practice okay


---------101:11----------
okay okay ready


---------101:14----------
go yeah


---------101:29----------
[Music]


---------101:48----------
[Music]


---------101:59----------
you


---------102:02----------
[Music]


---------102:10----------
[Music]


---------102:26----------
one


---------102:30----------
[Music]


---------102:42----------
[Music]


---------102:45----------
okay


---------102:48----------
i couldn't i couldn't hold it i'm sorry


---------102:50----------
hold what


---------102:51----------
my laughter i let it out a tiny bit so


---------102:55----------
i enjoyed it but it's very hard for me


---------102:57----------
to turn my brain off of knowing that


---------102:58----------
stream is on like it's hard


---------103:02----------
to do it because i know it's on my brain


---------103:05----------
never forgets


---------103:06----------
okay so then unless you've been on


---------103:08----------
that's no big deal


---------103:10----------
okay so um next thing


---------103:13----------
to to think about is so the next time


---------103:15----------
you're feeling


---------103:16----------
ahead or behind okay if you're really


---------103:19----------
feeling a header behind


---------103:21----------
i want you to do this practice and


---------103:22----------
listen to the sound


---------103:24----------
and then ask yourself


---------103:28----------
like in this moment as you listen to the


---------103:30----------
oscillations of sound


---------103:31----------
how can you possibly be a header behind


---------103:37----------
what is it that where what is this idea


---------103:39----------
of a header behind


---------103:41----------
where does it come from and then let


---------103:43----------
yourself return to the sound and notice


---------103:46----------
that the sound is what's real


---------103:49----------
you are what's real there's no


---------103:52----------
there's no aheadness or behindness


---------103:56----------
here right like this is just it's just


---------103:58----------
reality


---------104:00----------
where your teacher is good or bad they


---------104:02----------
just were what they were


---------104:04----------
they made you into the person that you


---------104:05----------
are if your teachers weren't the way


---------104:07----------
that they were


---------104:08----------
you wouldn't have been able to teach


---------104:09----------
your basketball students


---------104:11----------
the lessons that you taught them and so


---------104:14----------

---------104:15----------

---------104:21----------
