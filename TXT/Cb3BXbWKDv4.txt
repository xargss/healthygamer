---------09:27----------
mid-afternoon pick me up let's do our


---------09:32----------
last round so before we do our last


---------09:35----------
round I'm going to tell you guys now why


---------09:36----------
we do yoga okay


---------09:38----------
the purpose of yoga is to bring your


---------09:40----------
attention to the present so that you


---------09:42----------
can't think about anything else


---------09:43----------
it is the preparatory step for


---------09:46----------
meditation right so what we do is we use


---------09:48----------
our body is an anchor to keep us from


---------09:52----------
thinking distracting thoughts and our


---------09:55----------
body is a really powerful anchor


---------09:57----------
especially when you do all these poses


---------09:58----------
and so now for this next round what I


---------10:03----------
really want you guys to focus on is


---------10:05----------
adopt as much or as little of the


---------10:08----------
posture as you can with the goal not


---------10:12----------
being how far do you stretch or how far


---------10:15----------
you reach or how straight your back is


---------10:17----------
the goal should be to adopt a particular


---------10:19----------
physical posture your judge of whether


---------10:22----------
you're doing yoga correctly should not


---------10:24----------
come from anything that anyone can see


---------10:26----------
whether you're doing go over correctly


---------10:28----------
comes entirely from here what is your


---------10:31----------
mind doing can you keep the posture


---------10:34----------
stable but with attention in the present


---------10:38----------
or not so you want it to be stable but


---------10:40----------
we want it to be demanding enough to


---------10:42----------
where your mind is focusing on keeping


---------10:44----------
that posture how it is if you become too


---------10:47----------
comfortable than the mind begins to


---------10:48----------
wander if it becomes too difficult then


---------10:51----------
you cannot maintain it for a long time


---------10:52----------
you guys see that the goal is to


---------10:54----------
maintain your mind in the present


---------10:56----------
for as long as possible that's why we do


---------10:59----------
yoga okay so now put your feet together


---------11:03----------
and we're going to begin again so eyes


---------11:07----------
closed or open if you need stability and


---------11:14----------
just feel your body feel it in this


---------11:16----------
present moment feel your palms feel your


---------11:20----------
elbows feel your chest your shoulders


---------11:23----------
your knees you can anchor in on the the


---------11:28----------
instability if you want to and now arms


---------11:33----------
up now feel how your back is different


---------11:38----------
in this position feel the stretch in the


---------11:41----------
pole kind of beneath your shoulder


---------11:44----------
blades in between your shoulder blades


---------11:46----------
in your spine and reach up even further


---------11:50----------
see what it does to your body is used is


---------11:52----------
you become ramrod straight see how your


---------11:57----------
breath is constructed and now down now


---------12:08----------
once again feel what your body's tells


---------12:10----------
you tightness in the neck take this in


---------12:14----------

---------12:22----------

---------12:29----------
now we're going to go forward right leg


---------12:32----------

---------12:34----------

---------12:40----------

---------12:51----------
being pushed up a little bit feel the


---------12:53----------

---------12:56----------

---------13:14----------
instability begin to come on try to keep


---------13:18----------
your back but then feet straight note


---------13:23----------

---------13:24----------
straight and then relax number


---------13:38----------
and notice that even though one relaxed


---------13:40----------
now there may not be a whole lot of


---------13:41----------
physical strain your body is still


---------13:44----------
sending you signals in the present


---------13:48----------
relaxation can be a signal as well


---------14:01----------

---------14:09----------

---------14:11----------

---------14:19----------

---------14:31----------
now and then downward-facing dog with


---------14:38----------

---------18:28----------
meditation so today we'll be doing a


---------18:33----------
third eye meditation


---------18:44----------
you want to grab a Christian or to try


---------18:48----------
to sit in a way that's comfortable


---------18:50----------
remember that if you elevate your butt


---------18:54----------
that it'll be easier to sit up straight


---------18:56----------
so keep your back straight we're going


---------19:00----------
to do charging the laser beam so take


---------19:03----------
your middle finger you place it about


---------19:08----------
half maybe about a half an inch or a


---------19:11----------
quarter inch away from the center of


---------19:12----------
your forehead between your eyebrows


---------19:15----------
don't touch keep your eyes closed


---------19:19----------
move it as close as you can without


---------19:21----------
touching even though you aren't touching


---------19:25----------
you should be able to feel the fingers


---------19:28----------
just concentrate on the sensation that's


---------19:30----------
created in your forehead or possibly


---------19:34----------
between your forehead and your finger


---------19:50----------
go ahead and relax and continue to focus


---------19:52----------

---------23:30----------
struggles the world may be falling apart


---------23:36----------

---------23:42----------

---------23:46----------

---------23:50----------

---------23:56----------

---------23:58----------
heat in the friction drop them over your


---------24:01----------

---------24:05----------
exhalation open your eyes and letting


---------24:07----------

---------24:48----------
poll there's my take a three minute


---------24:57----------
break


---------25:04----------
what do y'all think


---------25:26----------
okay looks like most people don't want


---------25:28----------
to take a break but there are enough


---------25:29----------
people that do so why don't we take a


---------25:36----------
three-minute plate break because there


---------25:38----------

---------25:39----------
use the bathroom I think it's perfectly


---------25:41----------
fine guys so let's not be impatient


---------25:42----------
let's take a quick break I'm gonna need


---------25:44----------
a minute to set up reflector and get


---------25:46----------
some water and stuff like that anyway so


---------25:49----------
why don't we take a break let's be


---------25:51----------
patient let's take a moment for a mind


---------25:53----------
to go ahead and recalibrate will start


---------25:56----------
at in about three minutes okay and then


---------26:02----------
we'll be prepared notice how you feel


---------26:04----------
now and you'll be properly prepared to


---------26:08----------
learn when we get back okay


---------26:58----------
you gotta be carrying


---------27:15----------
there we go


---------27:18----------
said the fact


---------27:46----------
this is black you gotta be kidding me


---------27:50----------
what is wrong with this thing this is


---------28:02----------
what I get from trying to you know make


---------28:04----------
sure everything works ahead of time


---------28:30----------
okay saved okay I swear guys it's like


---------28:42----------
look I do the same damn thing every


---------28:44----------
single time and it's just it's finicky


---------28:48----------
I'm telling you guys it's not it's not


---------28:50----------
my fault okay let's see if we can um so


---------29:00----------
let's get started okay so today


---------29:04----------
hopefully everyone's back we're gonna


---------29:06----------
talk about meditation okay so let's


---------29:12----------
start by talking about meditation it's


---------29:22----------
working box so this is going to be a


---------29:27----------
little bit of a more slightly more


---------29:32----------
academic lecture okay so a lot of people


---------29:34----------
wonder like what kind of meditation


---------29:36----------
actually let me go shut the door


---------29:51----------
okay I'm pretty sure that their pancakes


---------29:54----------
being made downstairs and they smell


---------29:56----------
delicious okay


---------29:59----------
so a lot of people are wondering what


---------30:04----------
kind of meditation should they do and


---------30:06----------
like even what is meditation because


---------30:09----------
people don't really know so we're going


---------30:10----------
to start with a little bit of history of


---------30:11----------
meditation so the first kind of


---------30:14----------
meditation was actually developed by


---------30:15----------
convicts


---------30:17----------
okay so thumper is a discipline it's


---------30:19----------
probably 5,000 years old but there is a


---------30:22----------
form of mysticism and tends to have


---------30:28----------
three parts


---------30:30----------
Jahna mantra and young fit-up okay


---------30:44----------
and so yagna is like a ritual so this is


---------30:49----------
like casting Emma


---------30:57----------
ritual mantra is like a phrase that


---------31:06----------
accumulates energy and this is like a


---------31:13----------
geometric energy accumulator


---------31:21----------
so the first thing to understand about


---------31:23----------
Panthro


---------31:23----------
is that thun thourough is is about the


---------31:26----------
accumulation of energy so in a sense the


---------31:33----------
focus is on sort of the interaction


---------31:38----------
between south and the outside so it's


---------31:40----------
like self outside and contradicts


---------31:46----------
believe that basically you can do these


---------31:47----------
three things to accumulate particular


---------31:51----------
kinds of energy to exert an influence on


---------31:53----------
the outside world so goal of eases


---------31:55----------
influence the outside world actually not


---------31:59----------
necessarily the outside world but to get


---------32:02----------
a sort of a tangible benefit so there


---------32:04----------
are mantras for example that you know


---------32:09----------
like there are certain kinds of like


---------32:11----------
month rows and fasts that Hindus do to


---------32:13----------
like get good husbands for example or


---------32:15----------
their mantras to gain health or mantras


---------32:18----------
for prosperity or things like that so


---------32:21----------
like bunker is like basically it's like


---------32:22----------
it's almost like a system of magic okay


---------32:25----------
and there are fine thick meditations and


---------32:27----------
the founder of meditations are sort of


---------32:29----------
geared towards


---------32:38----------
okay they're geared towards some sort of


---------32:42----------
accumulating particular energies to get


---------32:44----------
particular ends and so over here we're


---------32:46----------
going to have Kundalini Yoga so we'll


---------32:49----------
talk about when doing is in a second and


---------32:51----------
so over time the tantrics actually


---------32:55----------
developed yoga and yoga is sort of a


---------33:01----------
system to reach enlightenment okay and


---------33:11----------
and so let's just think about this for a


---------33:14----------
second so yoga the the root word of yoga


---------33:16----------
is huge and huge means union or yoke and


---------33:23----------
what that means is that like yoga is


---------33:27----------
essentially like there's this concept in


---------33:29----------
Eastern religions that our consciousness


---------33:31----------
is part of a bigger consciousness called


---------33:34----------
brahman and so then basically the unit


---------33:36----------
of existence is consciousness there's


---------33:38----------
this whole sea of consciousness and we


---------33:41----------
become a drop out of that like we take a


---------33:43----------
drop out of that ocean and we embody it


---------33:45----------
within a physical form and that's you so


---------33:48----------
there's a part of you that's the


---------33:49----------
physical form but your true essence is


---------33:51----------
this like like tiny bit of consciousness


---------33:53----------
so this is the idea that you know


---------33:55----------
enlightenment it people call it


---------33:57----------
realization or enlightenment it's not


---------34:00----------
learning it's not discovering something


---------34:02----------
new it's actually remembering something


---------34:04----------
old right realization is a new


---------34:08----------
perspective on something that you


---------34:10----------
already know it's not gaining new


---------34:12----------
knowledge so the process of


---------34:14----------
enlightenment is this stepwise process


---------34:18----------
to become aware that you are actually


---------34:21----------
divine and eternal and all this other


---------34:23----------
like wonderful beautiful stuff okay but


---------34:27----------
the main thing here is that what yoga is


---------34:30----------
really for is is it's to help us become


---------34:33----------
one with this thing called the infinite


---------34:35----------
or brahmand it's kind of hard to


---------34:37----------
describe because you have to experience


---------34:38----------
for a month to really understand what it


---------34:40----------
is it's kind of like I want you guys to


---------34:42----------
imagine this for a second so imagine


---------34:44----------
that you've never been in a body of


---------34:46----------
water


---------34:46----------
so you've seen water you've drank water


---------34:48----------
but you've never like been under water


---------34:51----------
it's very very difficult to describe to


---------34:54----------
someone what the experience of moving in


---------34:56----------
water or being underwater is like it's


---------35:00----------
like you can say like yeah you can


---------35:01----------
you're moving but it's like you're


---------35:03----------
moving slowly right like how would you


---------35:06----------
how would someone who has never been


---------35:08----------
underwater like know what slow movement


---------35:11----------
feels like you know you could use a word


---------35:13----------
sluggish but like sluggish is not you


---------35:16----------
know doesn't accurate descriptor stand


---------35:19----------
Brahman and what that means you really


---------35:21----------
have to experience it so yoga is the


---------35:24----------
process so the fabrics basically were


---------35:26----------
like okay like there's this they develop


---------35:28----------
this process of yoga and yoga is the


---------35:31----------
process of becoming one with the divine


---------35:33----------
or whatever realization enlightenment


---------35:35----------
all all the same thing the other


---------35:37----------
interesting thing about yoga is that it


---------35:39----------
involves the word yoke so that's kind of


---------35:41----------
like Sanskrit has these dual meanings so


---------35:43----------
the other thing about yoga is that yoga


---------35:45----------
also means freedom so yoga is that which


---------35:50----------
frees you from the thing that binds you


---------35:53----------
to life and also that which joins you to


---------35:56----------
the infinite okay so it's kind of weird


---------35:59----------
so it's like sort of freedom and


---------36:00----------
liberation and like that which is bound


---------36:02----------
through the process of becoming unbound


---------36:04----------
and then in yoga


---------36:07----------
there are we'll get to Kundalini in a


---------36:09----------
second so in yoga there are four kinds


---------36:15----------
of yoga


---------36:16----------
so there's karma yoga bhakti yoga


---------36:26----------
jnana-yoga and Garagiola okay and these


---------36:37----------
are paths to enlightenment so what does


---------36:46----------
this mean this means that this process


---------36:49----------
of liberation can be attained through


---------36:52----------
basically four four ways so this is the


---------36:54----------
path of action so this is the idea that


---------36:58----------
if you want to like get to God or become


---------37:00----------
enlightened you can just do it through


---------37:02----------
actions you can just a queue you can


---------37:04----------
just be a good person and do good things


---------37:05----------
you don't have to do yoga you don't have


---------37:07----------
to meditate you don't have to worship


---------37:08----------
someone you can just basically be like a


---------37:10----------
secular atheistic good person and if you


---------37:14----------
devote yourself to actions and kind of


---------37:16----------
like doing a good job you can become


---------37:18----------
enlightened


---------37:19----------
okay so gotta my Yogi's tend to be like


---------37:23----------
activists like a lot of them are sort of


---------37:25----------
cuddler Yogi's so like MLK or Mahatma


---------37:27----------
Gandhi Gandhi or like good examples of


---------37:30----------
karma Yogi's party Yoga is the path of


---------37:33----------
devotion so the best way to understand


---------37:35----------
this is essentially like religion but


---------37:40----------
not necessarily okay it includes


---------37:42----------
religion but isn't necessary exclusive


---------37:43----------
religion so any religion that we think


---------37:46----------
of where we sort of a religion as a set


---------37:48----------
of beliefs that if you follow it you'll


---------37:50----------
kind of be you know you'll go to heaven


---------37:52----------
or whatever like that stuff is


---------37:54----------
essentially devotion right so if you're


---------37:56----------
if you look at the judeo-christian


---------37:58----------
religion like you devote yourself to the


---------38:01----------
ideals and teachings of a particular God


---------38:04----------
so it can be like Jesus or the Father or


---------38:07----------
Yahweh or a lot like it can in the


---------38:10----------
Eastern religions it's like Krishna or


---------38:12----------
ROM or whoever or Shiva or whatever that


---------38:16----------
essentially like devoting yourself to a


---------38:18----------
particular God or ideal is like a way to


---------38:23----------
become divine the the other interesting


---------38:27----------
thing that the Yogi's actually say is


---------38:29----------
that it is not the object of devotion


---------38:31----------
that matters right so like they actually


---------38:35----------
say so there's like person there's


---------38:39----------
devotion


---------38:40----------
and then there's object so a lot of


---------38:46----------
times like religious conflict is kind of


---------38:49----------
centered on the idea that like my god is


---------38:51----------
better than your God right they say that


---------38:54----------
like okay so like when Hindus and


---------38:55----------
Muslims fight like a lot of it has to do


---------38:57----------
with like there's like religious


---------38:58----------
conflict going Jews and Muslims fight


---------39:00----------
there's like villages conflict there's


---------39:02----------
this idea of conversion or like my God


---------39:04----------
is better than your God but like what


---------39:06----------
the Yogi's actually noticed is that like


---------39:08----------
gods change over time they're like all


---------39:10----------
these tons of gods tons of religion it


---------39:13----------
actually doesn't make sense that any


---------39:15----------
particular God is like better than any


---------39:17----------
other God so there's like Zeus and then


---------39:20----------
there's also like Hades and then there's


---------39:22----------
Jesus and there's I'm sure a lot of


---------39:24----------
people will find this offensive I'm just


---------39:26----------
making statements and there's Krishna


---------39:28----------
there are all kinds of gods that have


---------39:30----------
existed in the history of humanity and


---------39:32----------
what the Yogi's observed and you guys


---------39:34----------
are completely inclined to agree or


---------39:37----------
disagree right so remember that the


---------39:39----------
purpose of me teaching is to give you


---------39:41----------
guys testable hypotheses not knowledge


---------39:44----------
what the Yogi's observed is that it's at


---------39:47----------
the act of devotion to your particular


---------39:49----------
God that is the important thing and what


---------39:52----------
I mean by that is that like they


---------39:53----------
basically looked at religious people or


---------39:55----------
they looked at religions and they said


---------39:56----------
some people who practice religion are


---------39:58----------
 and some people who practice


---------40:00----------
our religion are good therefore it is


---------40:02----------
not the religion itself that makes


---------40:04----------
someone good or bad it is like the


---------40:06----------
degree to which you devote yourself to


---------40:09----------
the ideal right so they kind of said


---------40:11----------
like it doesn't matter whether you


---------40:12----------
worship Zeus or Kali or Jesus or


---------40:15----------
whatever the act of devotion is the


---------40:17----------
important thing the other interesting


---------40:19----------
thing about huffy yoga is it doesn't


---------40:20----------
necessarily include religion it doesn't


---------40:23----------
include only religion so you can devote


---------40:25----------
yourself to a particular idea like


---------40:27----------
climate change right so you can say that


---------40:29----------
I'm gonna like if you put your heart and


---------40:32----------
soul and effort in mind behind like a


---------40:35----------
particular ideal and you devote yourself


---------40:37----------
to that you will become spiritually


---------40:39----------
purified in that process so that's where


---------40:41----------
like karma yoga and puck do kind of


---------40:43----------
overlap some but ultimately it's the


---------40:46----------
idea that you kind of set a target that


---------40:48----------
you say this thing is more important


---------40:50----------
than I am and that I'm going to become


---------40:52----------
an instrument


---------40:54----------
of like achieving this thing and that


---------40:57----------
instrument can be God if you're like


---------40:58----------
let's say you're a priest right so


---------41:00----------
you're like okay I'm going to become


---------41:01----------
like an instrument to be like God's will


---------41:04----------
or you can be an instrument of climate


---------41:06----------
change or you can be an instrument of


---------41:08----------
like whatever it doesn't matter the I


---------41:09----------
the main ideas that you devote yourself


---------41:11----------
to something and in that process so then


---------41:15----------
people may ask like okay can you devote


---------41:16----------
yourself to killing other people or


---------41:18----------
things like that the interesting thing


---------41:20----------
is that you know there are good things


---------41:21----------
that you can devote yourself to or bad


---------41:23----------
things that you can devote yourself to


---------41:24----------
in a sense yes like you can it the


---------41:27----------
object of your devotion doesn't matter


---------41:28----------
the manner of your devotion matters so


---------41:31----------
how you become devoted is very important


---------41:35----------
so I know that there are a lot of people


---------41:38----------
out there who seem to be for a cause but


---------41:40----------
they're like spiritually bereft right


---------41:42----------
they're like they're not they don't


---------41:44----------
actually whatever they devote themselves


---------41:46----------
to does not result in then then becoming


---------41:49----------
like humble or knowledgeable or like


---------41:54----------
spiritually like grown like less ego


---------41:56----------
like those kinds of things don't work so


---------41:58----------
I don't think that that's appropriate


---------41:59----------
devotion is the way in which you devote


---------42:02----------
yourself that's actually important not


---------42:03----------
what you devote yourself to okay so


---------42:07----------
that's devotion okay


---------42:08----------
Jonnie yoga's the path of knowledge or


---------42:12----------
contemplation and I used to think that I


---------42:15----------
was in jnana yogi but it turns out that


---------42:17----------
I'm not or I'm on the path of jnana yoga


---------42:19----------
so the path of knowledge apparently is


---------42:21----------
very very hard and very few people do it


---------42:23----------
and it's hard to learn it's essentially


---------42:25----------
contemplation so it's like kind of like


---------42:28----------
thinking your way to enlightenment so


---------42:29----------
it's not quite not logic but it's really


---------42:32----------
contemplation and like logic can come


---------42:34----------
out of contemplation but like logic


---------42:37----------
cannot make you reflective right so you


---------42:40----------
can like just because you learn


---------42:41----------
something logically doesn't mean that


---------42:43----------
you change but there's there's a


---------42:45----------
different process between reflecting and


---------42:49----------
logic the two may seem related but this


---------42:54----------
doesn't lead to change


---------43:00----------
this does so all I mean by this is that


---------43:08----------
if you look at your thought process


---------43:10----------
you'll notice that thinking about


---------43:12----------
something there like different ways in


---------43:14----------
which you can think about something and


---------43:16----------
some of the ways in which you think


---------43:18----------
about stuff will like cause you to


---------43:20----------
change and learn something and other


---------43:22----------
ways like don't cause you to learn and


---------43:24----------
change something and and so Jana yoga's


---------43:27----------
sort of the process of like figuring


---------43:29----------
teasing that apart and essentially doing


---------43:31----------
a lot in a lot of reflection about the


---------43:33----------
nature of the universe the nature of


---------43:35----------
yourself the nature of God and then you


---------43:37----------
can kind of become enlightened


---------43:38----------
so the path that I follow is around you


---------43:42----------
you're okay


---------43:43----------
in Rajee oh it has eight steps okay so


---------43:54----------
step number one is young on step number


---------43:58----------
two is neat on them okay so these are


---------44:03----------
observances personal society


---------44:12----------
so Yama and niyama or like codes of


---------44:15----------
conduct so this is like the closest


---------44:17----------
thing to like the ten commandments


---------44:18----------
although you don't have to follow them


---------44:19----------
because you're going to go to hell it's


---------44:21----------
just these are processes of spiritual


---------44:23----------
growth and as you move along this axis


---------44:27----------
this is just part of reason my


---------44:35----------
handwriting is bad is because half the


---------44:36----------
iPad is sitting off of the desk


---------44:57----------
he's gonna be a lot better when I'm back


---------44:59----------
at my other set okay so you spiritually


---------45:03----------
grow like through these processes so


---------45:04----------
yamas and niyamas soar things like


---------45:06----------
ahimsa or Bromage arya so himsa means


---------45:09----------
non-violence satya is truth so examples


---------45:13----------
are sathya truthfulness himsa


---------45:22----------
non-violence like other things include


---------45:28----------
cleanliness so these are observances


---------45:31----------
that you do for yourself and observances


---------45:33----------
that you do towards other people and as


---------45:36----------
you start to become a truthful person so


---------45:38----------
if you stop lying


---------45:39----------
but Roger Yogi's are the Yogi's claim or


---------45:42----------
believe or tell you that they give you a


---------45:45----------
hypothesis that as you lie less as you


---------45:48----------
become less violent you become more of a


---------45:50----------
spiritual person I mean what a spiritual


---------45:52----------
mean it means moving a step closer to


---------45:54----------
enlightenment we'll talk about that in a


---------45:56----------
second okay you guys are probably like


---------45:58----------
what is this after you've meditation


---------45:59----------
we'll get there so next thing is awesome


---------46:02----------
these are yoga postures okay so why do


---------46:09----------
we do this because like so remember that


---------46:11----------
the goal here so we're going to end up


---------46:12----------
down here with Samadhi which is


---------46:16----------
temporary enlightenment so the goal of


---------46:23----------
Raja Yoga is to level up slowly to where


---------46:28----------
you get to like your last sage which is


---------46:30----------
somebody which is to enter into a state


---------46:33----------
of temporary enlightenment and in the


---------46:35----------
process of that leveling up like it's


---------46:37----------
hard like you can't just go you know


---------46:39----------
straight to endgame content some ideas


---------46:41----------
like endgame content and so in order to


---------46:44----------
get to Samadhi you have to like level up


---------46:45----------
with yama and the yama and the first


---------46:47----------
real meditative practice that you do


---------46:52----------
yes sorry the first meditative practice


---------46:57----------
that you do is actually awesome which is


---------46:59----------
physical postures so today when we were


---------47:00----------
doing yoga I was encouraging you guys to


---------47:03----------
notice that your mind is in the present


---------47:05----------
so your mind literally becomes trained


---------47:09----------
to like understand what being in the


---------47:11----------
dislike and the more time that you spend


---------47:13----------
being in the present and focused in


---------47:15----------
awesome the easier it is to meditate


---------47:18----------
afterward because your mind is already


---------47:20----------
like knows how to adopt that stance of


---------47:22----------
focus and in meditation so after that is


---------47:26----------
brown a.m. so these are breathing


---------47:31----------
techniques so a lot of the techniques


---------47:35----------
that I teach on stream or to you guys


---------47:38----------
are not actually meditation techniques


---------47:40----------
they're prime so pranayama is a set of


---------47:44----------
breathing techniques that's aimed to


---------47:45----------
stabilize your life force or Qi to make


---------47:48----------
your like body and mind conducive to


---------47:51----------
meditation so there used to like kind of


---------47:54----------
calm the mind but they're not actually


---------47:55----------
true meditation so next is breath the


---------48:01----------
hata


---------48:04----------
so these techniques are sensory


---------48:09----------
withdrawal techniques okay and so what


---------48:16----------
this means is these are these are


---------48:18----------
techniques that are designed to


---------48:22----------
essentially bring your senses into


---------48:25----------
yourself so if we think about so we're


---------48:28----------
going to talk about breathy haaaa


---------48:29----------
okay so I think this is an important


---------48:35----------
thing to understand sensory


---------48:45----------
with soul okay I'll work on my


---------48:50----------
handwriting as I promised so let's think


---------48:53----------
about this for a second normally our


---------48:56----------
attention goes how does our attention


---------49:00----------
like where's our attention so we have


---------49:03----------
sight sound smell touch in aesthetics so


---------49:20----------
if you think about it like our attention


---------49:22----------
normally like goes into these things


---------49:26----------
right so I'm walking down the street and


---------49:29----------
I smell something cooking and then like


---------49:31----------
my attention like follows that scent and


---------49:33----------
then my mind starts to think about food


---------49:38----------
and or I see something like I'm like oh


---------49:41----------
look there's an advertisement for a


---------49:43----------
video let's say I'm like on my computer


---------49:45----------
and then I'm scrolling through Reddit


---------49:47----------
and then I see like oh like on our


---------49:49----------
gaming like there's a game that's coming


---------49:51----------
out today like Mountain Blade 2 is


---------49:52----------
coming out today Oh interesting it's


---------49:54----------
early access something like my site then


---------49:56----------
triggers my mind and my attention kind


---------49:58----------
of like leaves my body like leaves my


---------50:01----------
mind and goes into whatever I'm looking


---------50:03----------
at so in my mind is occupied externally


---------50:06----------
so now my question pancakes exactly


---------50:09----------
right so now my question is what happens


---------50:14----------
when you're it so what happens to your


---------50:21----------
capacity to listen to music when you


---------50:25----------
close your eyes


---------50:34----------
what do you guys think


---------50:42----------
right so now my question okay so let's


---------50:47----------
assume this for a second so let's say


---------50:49----------
that I knock out site and then sound


---------50:51----------
gets enhanced smell gets enhanced but


---------50:55----------
let's do this try to get some hands


---------50:59----------
taste gets enhanced


---------51:01----------
and your kinesthetic sense gets in this


---------51:02----------
okay so now my question is like what


---------51:06----------
happens so when we're doing yoga and our


---------51:09----------
eyes are closed it's easier to feel our


---------51:11----------
our body right like it's easier to feel


---------51:14----------
the vibrations so let's say that we


---------51:16----------
knock this out what happens to the other


---------51:20----------
senses


---------51:33----------
what do you guys think


---------51:39----------
plus plus very good right so I want you


---------51:44----------
guys to think about this for a second so


---------51:46----------
first of all we're gonna notice what


---------51:47----------
this means what this means so when I'm


---------51:49----------
when I'm doing yoga and I close my eyes


---------51:54----------
and I focus on my body do you guys


---------51:57----------
understand that that doesn't mean


---------51:58----------
thoughts happen right so mine does not


---------52:01----------
anywhere in here mind is separate from


---------52:04----------
all of this because mind is thoughts and


---------52:08----------
I would argue that when you get lost in


---------52:11----------
your mind all of the ease actually


---------52:15----------
decrease does that make sense


---------52:17----------
like when I'm daydreaming or I'm


---------52:19----------
occupied in my thoughts my attention is


---------52:22----------
actually in the mind it's not in any of


---------52:24----------
my senses and if we think about a lot of


---------52:26----------
meditation techniques they involve using


---------52:30----------
the senses to pull you out of mind right


---------52:35----------
so like I almost want you guys to


---------52:37----------
envision it this way that it's mind


---------52:41----------
versus senses you guys see that


---------52:46----------
so like this this has an antagonistic


---------52:50----------
relationship to the sentences so so


---------52:54----------
let's just think about this for a second


---------52:55----------
so if I you know when I'm doing yoga and


---------52:58----------
I close my eyes and my kinesthetic sense


---------53:00----------
increases I'm focused in the present I


---------53:03----------
can feel my body in a new way if i close


---------53:05----------
my eyes and really smell food and taste


---------53:07----------
food and i'm not distracted by like


---------53:10----------
watching TV then the experience of food


---------53:14----------
enhances so there's an antagonistic


---------53:16----------
relationship between thoughts and senses


---------53:19----------
or thoughts and attention so the


---------53:21----------
attention can either go here towards the


---------53:23----------
mind or it can go to the others in in a


---------53:27----------
sense that's true of all the other


---------53:28----------
senses as well like if I'm you know


---------53:30----------
because we kind of said that if I close


---------53:32----------
my eyes my sound enhances so you could


---------53:35----------
argue that if I'm if I'm seeing and


---------53:38----------
hearing at the same time and that each


---------53:40----------
of those is reduced so there are


---------53:41----------
antagonistic relationships between all


---------53:43----------
of these so now my question to you guys


---------53:45----------
is if I if my attention if my mind is


---------53:48----------
empty so through yoga I've managed


---------53:52----------
in my mind because I'm not thinking


---------53:53----------
about anything and then I cut out each


---------53:56----------
sense where does my attention go what


---------54:01----------
does it focus on where does it go what's


---------54:09----------
here nope incorrect not thoughts what


---------54:20----------
does that mean to yourself what is


---------54:23----------
yourself what is that to the body no the


---------54:25----------
kinesthetic senses the body this is the


---------54:27----------
body enlightenment in the present


---------54:31----------
BIGBANG mind reflection cell what a self


---------54:34----------
what does you say self what is that


---------54:37----------
freedom nothing present what does that


---------54:40----------
mean empty just mean what present moment


---------54:44----------
what where's time in all this what does


---------54:49----------
time have to do or when I when I am


---------54:51----------
sensing my body and with my eyes closed


---------54:54----------
with full attention am I not in the


---------54:55----------
present moment so this is meditation


---------55:04----------
now you guys understand what meditation


---------55:06----------
is this is true meditation so you guys


---------55:12----------
are using all these words and you're


---------55:14----------
describing to me what it's like to swim


---------55:17----------
to someone who's never been in water so


---------55:21----------
this is meditation this is the goal of


---------55:24----------
meditation it's not to be in any of


---------55:26----------
these things


---------55:27----------
it's the systematic process of let me


---------55:31----------
put it this way this is actually a


---------55:32----------
better answer this is where your mind


---------55:38----------
goes this is what what it is okay so


---------55:42----------
what are the words that Yogi's used to


---------55:45----------
describe this Advait near gyoon Advait


---------55:52----------
means non-dual


---------55:55----------
what does that mean we ten


---------55:57----------
to think about things that are good or


---------55:59----------
bad light or dark positive or negative


---------56:02----------
hot or cold and this state is neither it


---------56:07----------
is non dual it is just one thing it is


---------56:09----------
what it is what my first description I


---------56:16----------
still have this description so I wrote


---------56:18----------
like a journal entry about my first real


---------56:22----------
experience of meditation and the title


---------56:24----------
of the journal entry was business and I


---------56:28----------
was really really excited because I felt


---------56:31----------
like I had discovered something and I


---------56:32----------
sent it to like half a dozen people who


---------56:34----------
I knew and I was like read this and like


---------56:37----------
tell me if you get it and everyone was


---------56:39----------
like I don't understand what the


---------56:40----------
you're talking about they didn't


---------56:41----------
understand like what I was saying and I


---------56:43----------
was just talking about like business


---------56:45----------
business is what this state is so in its


---------56:49----------
on script they call it non dual or


---------56:51----------
without quality so objects or things in


---------56:57----------
the world have qualities right this


---------56:59----------
shirt is blue this microphone is up the


---------57:02----------
microphone is on my head we can describe


---------57:04----------
qualities to all kinds of things their


---------57:06----------
location in space their color their


---------57:09----------
tastes their weight there are all kinds


---------57:11----------
of qualities that we give to all kinds


---------57:13----------
of stuff in the world we can say things


---------57:15----------
are good things are bad things are


---------57:16----------
pleasurable things are painful things


---------57:19----------
are present things are past things are


---------57:20----------
future there are all kinds of qualities


---------57:22----------
that we can ascribe but that this state


---------57:27----------
is actually without any quality it is


---------57:30----------
that which is with no quality and that


---------57:32----------
is what meditation is okay now let's go


---------57:38----------
back so now you guys see how like if you


---------57:42----------
want to get to the state so these last


---------57:44----------
two are gonna be about this state but if


---------57:48----------
you guys want to get there do you guys


---------57:50----------
see how like you have to train yourself


---------57:52----------
to do this process like Xing this out


---------57:55----------
and then Xing this out and then Xing


---------57:57----------
this out like this is something that you


---------57:59----------
can train yourself to do so this is what


---------58:01----------
practice is okay next is hot enough


---------58:06----------
which is focus so this is actually


---------58:09----------
taking the mind in


---------58:11----------
get on one thing so one pointedness of


---------58:14----------
the mind okay so now let's talk about


---------58:16----------
pattern number one pointed mind so let


---------58:25----------
me ask you guys something


---------58:26----------
what happens when I when something


---------58:36----------
becomes constant for me what happens to


---------58:41----------
my awareness of it you guys know it's


---------58:49----------
actually an AR so sorry it goes away


---------59:03----------
perfect right so if I put this shirt on


---------59:08----------
first thing in the morning I noticed the


---------59:10----------
shirt like when I put my deodorant on


---------59:12----------
this morning I noticed the smell and as


---------59:14----------
the smell becomes constant


---------59:16----------
I lose it right if you like if there's a


---------59:18----------
background hum of like construction


---------59:20----------
after a while you like get acclimatized


---------59:23----------
to it and it falls away so the goal of


---------59:26----------
tottentot is to use one object to push


---------59:34----------
all others away so you can't turn off


---------59:40----------
your mind you can't it's very hard to


---------59:43----------
push something out of your mind like if


---------59:45----------
you have anxiety and I tell you to stop


---------59:48----------
thinking about anxiety that does not


---------59:49----------
work right you can the mind you cannot


---------59:52----------
stop the mind all you can do is direct


---------59:55----------
the mind so when someone is having a


---------59:57----------
panic attack we don't tell you hey stop


---------60:00----------
thinking about the panic just stop


---------60:01----------
thinking those thoughts that doesn't


---------60:03----------
work what we do is we direct your mind


---------60:04----------
to a different place so we say okay


---------60:07----------
focus on your breath and take slow


---------60:08----------
breaths so you can redirect the mind


---------60:11----------
that you can't stop it can't stop it


---------60:23----------
okay so then the question becomes like


---------60:27----------
once you redirect the mind and then your


---------60:30----------
mind is focused on one thing what


---------60:32----------
happens when your mind acclimatize this


---------60:34----------
to that thing well we'll get to step six


---------60:44----------
and seven powder another step six


---------60:46----------
ah hold on a second


---------60:54----------
so moves on does it move on so actually


---------61:07----------
when you do not enough properly so this


---------61:09----------
is what we so this is how our mind works


---------61:11----------
okay object one object to object three


---------61:16----------
object four


---------61:18----------
so these are thoughts okay so what we're


---------61:22----------
gonna do with la donna is whenever we


---------61:26----------
have a thought we're gonna actually


---------61:28----------
direct it back so let's say object five


---------61:29----------
is the breath and then we have another


---------61:32----------
thought and then what I don't know we're


---------61:34----------
gonna be like come back to the breath


---------61:35----------
and then we think about pancakes so


---------61:39----------
we're gonna come back to the breath and


---------61:40----------
then we think about handwriting so we're


---------61:42----------
going to come back to the breath and


---------61:43----------
then over time all we're gonna have is


---------61:46----------
thought five and then eventually thought


---------61:50----------
five gets smaller smaller


---------61:54----------
and then we're left with this right so


---------62:00----------
what is this this is this this is the


---------62:08----------
question mark so all we have is raw


---------62:11----------
attention without any focus and then


---------62:17----------
you're left with emptiness and this is


---------62:20----------
step seven gianna this is really


---------62:26----------
meditative


---------62:28----------
State okay


---------62:33----------
sort of like mindfulness we'll talk


---------62:35----------
about mindfulness in a second okay so


---------62:39----------
this is where a lot of confusion around


---------62:41----------
meditation comes people say I'm not good


---------62:43----------
at meditating I can't meditate other


---------62:45----------
people are getting good at meditating


---------62:47----------
and I can't do it and when I ask them


---------62:50----------
what do you mean by that and they say


---------62:51----------
like I can't like people say empty their


---------62:53----------
thoughts I can't empty my thoughts so


---------62:55----------
the first thing to understand is that


---------62:57----------
not or not is a verb admit it sorry and


---------63:06----------
Beyond is a state so this is so I don't


---------63:13----------
know is something that you can do and


---------63:16----------
this is something that happens to you


---------63:21----------
right so when people say I had a very


---------63:23----------
productive meditation session what


---------63:25----------
they're talking about is that they


---------63:27----------
entered the state of meditation and they


---------63:29----------
hung out there for a while they spent


---------63:31----------
time over here okay other times people


---------63:36----------
say I didn't have a protected productive


---------63:39----------
meditation session and I tried and tried


---------63:40----------
and tried and it didn't work for me and


---------63:42----------
essentially they spent time here you


---------63:47----------
guys seen the difference and so when


---------63:49----------
people say like meditate you guys have


---------63:51----------
to understand that meditation is like


---------63:53----------
going to bed and falling asleep right


---------64:01----------
and what do I mean by that like so when


---------64:04----------
I say I I went to sleep at ten o'clock


---------64:06----------
last night that is impossible you cannot


---------64:09----------
go to sleep it is impossible to go to


---------64:11----------
sleep sleep is not a verb that you do


---------64:14----------
sleep is a state of mind that if you're


---------64:16----------
lucky you achieve or happens to you you


---------64:19----------
can go to bed I can lay down close my


---------64:21----------
eyes and pull the covers over my head or


---------64:24----------
under my head but that's not sleep


---------64:26----------
that's going to bed what is something


---------64:28----------
you can do one is something that happens


---------64:30----------
to you and that's what's hotter a nun


---------64:31----------
Tiana's one of the biggest problems in


---------64:34----------
English is that like when we teach


---------64:36----------
meditation we don't draw the distinction


---------64:39----------
between verb and state like we don't


---------64:41----------
each that as part of the basics which i


---------64:43----------
think is criminal because like no wonder


---------64:45----------
like people just misunderstand


---------64:46----------
meditation so hard and that's because


---------64:49----------
what happens is you have people who


---------64:51----------
really understand meditation who then


---------64:54----------
trained people who become certified in


---------64:57----------
meditation and then they go and teach


---------64:59----------
other people because you're a certified


---------65:01----------
meditation teacher but a certified


---------65:03----------
meditation teacher does not make you a


---------65:04----------
good meditation teacher because in the


---------65:06----------
West we have like qualifications that


---------65:09----------
you meet but good teachers are gurus


---------65:12----------
right and like a good teacher can teach


---------65:14----------
and then people don't understand the


---------65:17----------
reason that so many people misunderstand


---------65:18----------
meditation is because you have a lot of


---------65:20----------
certified and bad teachers out there


---------65:22----------
doesn't mean that they they're not like


---------65:24----------
good people it just means that they're


---------65:25----------
not qualified to teach but they teach


---------65:28----------
because they're certified fine so in the


---------65:30----------
old system there was no certification


---------65:33----------
for meditation teaching your teacher


---------65:36----------
basically said okay now you are capable


---------65:38----------
of teaching like they just assign you


---------65:41----------
like that certification


---------65:42----------
whereas now like we essentially have a


---------65:45----------
protocol for certification if you go


---------65:47----------
through eight weeks of training your


---------65:49----------
certified teacher it's not an individual


---------65:52----------
assessment of like the teachers


---------65:55----------
capability to teach and that's why I


---------65:57----------
think we have a lot of misunderstandings


---------65:59----------
okay so let's kind of go back to this so


---------66:04----------
pattern of Keanu and Samadhi


---------66:06----------
okay so beyond is the meditative state


---------66:08----------
of mind where it's a no mind state and


---------66:10----------
you're kind of like in this place okay


---------66:14----------
you're over here actually there's


---------66:18----------
there's two phases actually so this is


---------66:20----------
Eon and this is so much okay so that


---------66:26----------
they're actually like sub levels so even


---------66:28----------
in Samadhi they're like further two


---------66:31----------
levels of this so that's kind of beyond


---------66:36----------
our scope because you really have to


---------66:37----------
experience some honey they even


---------66:39----------
understand it's kind of like me saying


---------66:41----------
you know it's like trying to explain


---------66:43----------
like color to a blind person let alone


---------66:48----------
the blind person doesn't even understand


---------66:50----------
sight but like trying to explain color


---------66:53----------
to them is even like a completely


---------66:55----------
different thing


---------66:55----------
so the first thing is like you know you


---------66:58----------
have to start by like looking at the


---------66:59----------
world in black and white and that we can


---------67:02----------
kind of do like I can I can explain the


---------67:05----------
idea that like you can visually perceive


---------67:08----------
objects to a blind person and then once


---------67:10----------
you're able to visually perceive things


---------67:12----------
then like you take the next step of


---------67:14----------
explaining color to a colorblind person


---------67:15----------
so we're kind of two steps away so we're


---------67:18----------
not going to go into further states of


---------67:19----------
Samadhi okay so let's actually stick


---------67:23----------
here so now so this is meditation okay


---------67:28----------
this is like understanding meditation so


---------67:30----------
let's kind of try to recap a little bit


---------67:32----------
so when we think about meditative


---------67:35----------
techniques there are a couple of


---------67:37----------
different techniques that we can use or


---------67:40----------
actually let's just talk about


---------67:40----------
mindfulness for a second so what is my


---------67:43----------
boss so mindfulness is actually in


---------67:49----------
Sanskrit it's called sakshi Wow or


---------67:55----------
witnessing attitude and Sakshi Prague is


---------68:02----------
the first step of not enough so it's


---------68:05----------
like the first achievement sorry first


---------68:07----------
step of beyond so there are actually


---------68:09----------
like a lot of states of mind so Sachi


---------68:11----------
Bob is kind of like the most basic state


---------68:15----------
of pion and there are further levels of


---------68:17----------
John and even further levels of Samadhi


---------68:20----------
so mindfulness is not even it's not


---------68:22----------
really even a meditative state it's just


---------68:24----------
a witnessing attitude it's the capacity


---------68:27----------
to separate so it's the capacity to


---------68:31----------
separate self from mind and observe this


---------68:40----------
difference okay so that like these are


---------68:47----------
separate things


---------68:47----------
there's dit actually what I should do is


---------68:50----------
this so most of the time we don't really


---------68:55----------
think about ourselves is different from


---------68:57----------
our mind we don't really think about the


---------69:00----------
fact that there's like a gap between


---------69:01----------
self and mind like we think that who we


---------69:05----------
are is what we think


---------69:08----------
so mindfulness is like increasing the


---------69:11----------
gap between self and mine and just


---------69:17----------
observing this difference this


---------69:18----------
difference is mindfulness it's not even


---------69:22----------
really meditation and and so mindfulness


---------69:26----------
is like a great preparatory exercise but


---------69:29----------
the goal like you'll cultivate


---------69:30----------
mindfulness if you do this practice but


---------69:32----------
it's not the goal it's just it's like


---------69:35----------
the first realization that self and mind


---------69:37----------
are different okay and then as you get


---------69:40----------
deeper you'll do different kinds of


---------69:42----------
you'll get a bit deeper understanding so


---------69:44----------
what does this mean practically okay so


---------69:46----------
now I'm going to run through a couple of


---------69:47----------
things so if you want to meditate what


---------69:50----------
kind of meditation should you do so if


---------69:53----------
couldn't aleni yoga I'm gonna talk about


---------69:54----------
Kundalini Yoga for a second pause it's


---------69:57----------
there that there are seven chakras and


---------70:00----------
each chakra has certain attributes and


---------70:09----------
that working on these chakras will give


---------70:11----------
you certain how can I say the certain


---------70:18----------
achievements or abilities so for example


---------70:26----------
when I'm teaching meditation personally


---------70:29----------
one-on-one to someone who wants like


---------70:31----------
like okay so then what we have to think


---------70:37----------
about let's just pause reciting so let


---------70:39----------
me say this so what I want you guys to


---------70:41----------
understand is that thun throt is about


---------70:43----------
sort of the outside world and yoga is


---------70:45----------
really about the self so nothing in yoga


---------70:49----------
has anything to do with like money or


---------70:51----------
power or fame or wealth or any any kind


---------70:55----------
of stuff Yoga is just about the


---------70:57----------
systematic process of like being able to


---------70:59----------
do things like this this is what Yoga is


---------71:02----------
about this is what yoga is about nothing


---------71:04----------
here has anything to do with like magic


---------71:07----------
or accumulating wealth or power or


---------71:08----------
anything like that done through is about


---------71:11----------
that stuff done throw is about


---------71:12----------
accumulating a particular kind of Shakti


---------71:15----------
or energy and then directing that energy


---------71:17----------
towards a particular goal now directing


---------71:20----------
that energy you could direct it towards


---------71:21----------
your personal


---------71:22----------
spiritual practice so the mantra that I


---------71:24----------
started using myself that my teacher


---------71:27----------
gave me so he asked me like are you


---------71:29----------
interested in being like


---------71:30----------
materialistically successful or


---------71:32----------
spiritually successful and I said I want


---------71:35----------
both and he said okay that's fine so he


---------71:37----------
gave me a mantra that helped me grow


---------71:40----------
spiritually it also helped me become


---------71:42----------
materialistically successful so I really


---------71:45----------
do I mean it's kind of weird but like


---------71:46----------
when I think about moving from you know


---------71:49----------
2.5 GPA to like being a harvard-trained


---------71:52----------
physician and faculty at Harvard Medical


---------71:53----------
School I really wonder about


---------71:56----------
statistically how how often that happens


---------71:58----------
if the statistical probability is quite


---------72:03----------
low it makes me wonder if there was


---------72:05----------
something specific that I did to


---------72:07----------
increase my odds and I really do I know


---------72:10----------
this sounds crazy I don't understand it


---------72:12----------
myself but if you just look at it if


---------72:14----------
there's a statistical phenomenon that's


---------72:15----------
quite rare either I am one out of a


---------72:18----------
million or there is something out there


---------72:22----------
some other factor at play that is


---------72:24----------
responsible for my success and I


---------72:26----------
sometimes wonder if the month are is


---------72:27----------
responsible for that success because


---------72:29----------
I've been tainting this month or now for


---------72:32----------
16 years and like my life seems to be on


---------72:37----------
a generally upward trajectory so who


---------72:38----------
knows so Don Thoreau though is about


---------72:41----------
sort of directing energy towards a


---------72:46----------
particular outcome yes so survivorship


---------72:49----------
bias is completely correct right so it's


---------72:52----------
it's very possible so I'm not saying


---------72:55----------
that like I don't think that we have


---------72:56----------
enough evidence that month or is


---------72:58----------
actually work I don't think so so there


---------73:02----------
are so Thunder is sort of about


---------73:05----------
accumulation of energy and directing


---------73:06----------
that energy Yoga is about purification


---------73:09----------
of the self and moving towards


---------73:11----------
enlightenment and Kundalini Yoga is kind


---------73:13----------
of in the middle so Kundalini Yoga is


---------73:16----------
about purification of certain chakras


---------73:19----------
and as you purify those chakras you gain


---------73:22----------
certain kinds of abilities or intuitions


---------73:24----------
of house and what I mean by that is like


---------73:26----------
so I'll ask people when I you know when


---------73:30----------
I'm teaching them Kundalini Yoga if I


---------73:31----------
think they're good for Kundalini Yoga


---------73:32----------
I'll ask them are you interested in


---------73:34----------
controlling


---------73:35----------
impulses are you interested in


---------73:39----------
metabolizing negativity are you


---------73:45----------
interested in gaining compassion are you


---------73:50----------
interested in exerting influence on the


---------74:03----------
outside world or are you interested in


---------74:09----------
knowledge and basically depending on


---------74:15----------
what they pick out of these I'll teach


---------74:18----------
them different kinds of practices so now


---------74:22----------
we got to just talk about neuroscience


---------74:23----------
for a second so lately there are all


---------74:26----------
these different techniques of meditation


---------74:27----------
so you can do month or you can do


---------74:29----------
Kundalini Yoga you can do Raja yoga


---------74:34----------
right and even within Raji o you can do


---------74:36----------
awesome so you can do physical things


---------74:37----------
you can do breathing techniques you can


---------74:39----------
do sensory withdrawal techniques you can


---------74:41----------
do focusing techniques all of these are


---------74:44----------
forms of meditation so which one do you


---------74:46----------
pick and it kind of depends on what


---------74:48----------
you're looking for so if you want a


---------74:50----------
particular outcome in the in the in the


---------74:58----------
material world I would say that like


---------74:59----------
thunder is better for you if you want to


---------75:02----------
grow in a very specific way a particular


---------75:06----------
part of your capability than I think


---------75:09----------
Kundalini Yoga is good and this is where


---------75:12----------
I believe that different meditation


---------75:14----------
techniques map to different parts of the


---------75:16----------
brain in terms of like what they do and


---------75:19----------
so doing a particular meditation


---------75:21----------
technique I think for example you know


---------75:24----------
on aa hudsucker techniques which are the


---------75:26----------
heart chakra which are the compassion


---------75:29----------
techniques so like Metta meditation is a


---------75:31----------
good example of this I believe that


---------75:33----------
those kinds of techniques actually work


---------75:36----------
on a different part of your brain like


---------75:37----------
they work on your empathic centers of


---------75:39----------
the brain more so than like let's say


---------75:41----------
your your knowledge kind of centers so


---------75:45----------
like your intuition or your brains


---------75:47----------
ability to calculate is


---------75:49----------
different from your brain's ability to


---------75:52----------
calculate or subconsciously process


---------75:55----------
because that's where intuition comes


---------75:56----------
from using your brain's capacity to


---------75:58----------
subconsciously process or calculate is


---------76:01----------
fundamentally different from your


---------76:02----------
brain's capacity to be empathic or


---------76:05----------
compassionate and so I think that like


---------76:08----------
was you do these different techniques


---------76:10----------
the best explanation that I can come up


---------76:11----------
with is that it actually Maps the


---------76:14----------
different parts of the brain and there's


---------76:16----------
very preliminary evidence of this


---------76:17----------
there's actually a study that was done


---------76:19----------
out of UCLA that actually looked at like


---------76:23----------
an aha chakra meditation specifically so


---------76:25----------
compassion oriented meditations and


---------76:27----------
whether they're different from a


---------76:29----------
neuroscience perspective than other


---------76:31----------
forms of meditation likes traditional


---------76:32----------
mindfulness and there are studies on


---------76:35----------
things like TM and other forms of


---------76:37----------
meditation which show that there are


---------76:40----------
actually different EEG patterns


---------76:41----------
depending on what kind of meditation you


---------76:43----------
do so there's some basic evidence that


---------76:46----------
meditation of there is actually evidence


---------76:49----------
we can we can conclude that meditation


---------76:51----------
affects the brain in different ways so


---------76:54----------
different meditation techniques affect


---------76:55----------
the brain in different ways that is


---------76:57----------
actually a scientific statement of fact


---------76:58----------
but how each meditation affects the


---------77:02----------
brain and in what ways certain


---------77:04----------
meditation techniques affect the brain


---------77:06----------
we actually have no idea we have very


---------77:08----------
little scientific data for that so I am


---------77:12----------
sort of extrapolating or using reasoning


---------77:16----------
to connect dots that may be


---------77:17----------
scientifically invalid that each of


---------77:19----------
these meditation techniques work


---------77:21----------
somewhat differently on the brain last


---------77:25----------
thing that I'll share with you guys is


---------77:26----------
that impulse control is what I do for


---------77:28----------
addiction so what I can say


---------77:31----------
scientifically here is that when I teach


---------77:34----------
people these impulse control techniques


---------77:36----------
they're their addiction their ability to


---------77:39----------
control their addiction in their


---------77:41----------
sobriety improves and furthermore


---------77:43----------
improves over groups of people who do


---------77:46----------
like plain mindfulness so does that mean


---------77:49----------
that I'm a better clinician that could


---------77:51----------
be a confounding variable I just need


---------77:52----------
maybe a better teacher it may not be the


---------77:54----------
kind of technique that I teach it may be


---------77:56----------
like my personal clinical impact but I


---------78:00----------
really do believe that these type


---------78:02----------
kind of do work so like impose control


---------78:04----------
of meditation techniques are better at


---------78:07----------
controlling addictions then let's say


---------78:09----------
like intuition or knowledge techniques


---------78:11----------
these are the techniques that I use for


---------78:12----------
trauma these are the techniques that I


---------78:17----------
use for wealth for lack of a better term


---------78:23----------
so when I have a client that comes to me


---------78:25----------
that says that I want to be like more


---------78:27----------
materialistically successful I teach


---------78:29----------
them these techniques and then for


---------78:33----------
people who just want to understand like


---------78:35----------
who they are and how they work in the


---------78:37----------
nature of the universe I teach them


---------78:39----------
these techniques but people just want to


---------78:43----------
know like some people come to me and


---------78:44----------
they're like I want to understand how


---------78:46----------
this stuff works


---------78:47----------
but all I just want to understand all of


---------78:49----------
it so this actually is my personal path


---------78:52----------
so I do these kinds of techniques and so


---------78:56----------
that's meditation so let's see if we've


---------78:57----------
got what we're going to take a couple of


---------78:59----------
questions so let's go ahead and start so


---------79:02----------
I'm gonna start with near critique and


---------79:07----------
Kevin and Kabir Tech teller okay so


---------79:17----------
let's see if we can get you guys in


---------79:22----------
which meditations for gamers great


---------79:24----------
question so I think it depends on on


---------79:27----------
where you are but I think that you


---------79:29----------
should start with actually pranayama or


---------79:32----------
should the techniques okay people are


---------79:36----------
joining great


---------79:46----------
hey dr. Kate hey yeah so hi the question


---------79:51----------
is so Abby's breath primary pronoun yeah


---------79:55----------
is that a bra Nia Donna no technique or


---------79:59----------
but the heretic because it was you


---------80:02----------
buzzing ow


---------80:03----------
it sort of inhibits your uh no sound I


---------80:08----------
guess like it you focuses on within the


---------80:10----------
song dies down so I was wondering was


---------80:12----------
technique tennis yes so Brahma refrán I


---------80:15----------
surprised I am is the pranayama so the


---------80:17----------
be the actual humming is upon I am but


---------80:20----------
the Shan Mookie mudra which is this this


---------80:24----------
thing that we do mm-hmm the that's a


---------80:29----------
pratyahara right just like so the Shan


---------80:33----------
Wilke mudras or pratyahara mudra and you


---------80:36----------
can combine them so there are some


---------80:37----------
things like you know you'll have


---------80:39----------
different teachers will have different


---------80:41----------
kinds of like Korea's so take like two


---------80:44----------
or three different meditation techniques


---------80:45----------
and they'll make their own meditation


---------80:47----------
brand TM and they'll say like this is


---------80:50----------
mine and this is my special technique I


---------80:52----------
think it's better than all the others I


---------80:54----------
mean since my second question is what


---------80:57----------
about the potentially psychosis that you


---------80:59----------
talked about that can occur from


---------81:00----------
Kundalini Yoga and is there a way you


---------81:02----------
can predict the risk of that in a person


---------81:04----------
yeah so that's a great question so


---------81:06----------
fantastic question so one thing that


---------81:08----------
I'll tell you guys is that meditation is


---------81:10----------
not without risks so there are case


---------81:13----------
reports of meditation induced psychosis


---------81:15----------
which is quite rare of a phenomenon but


---------81:19----------
I think that like you know a lot of the


---------81:20----------
techniques that I mean some thankfully


---------81:23----------
most meditation like the world does not


---------81:27----------
really understand like more than than


---------81:29----------
two percent of meditation techniques all


---------81:32----------
of the meditation that's being taught by


---------81:34----------
headspace and mindfulness and things


---------81:36----------
like that that's finally primarily


---------81:38----------
because mindfulness is what spread


---------81:39----------
mindfulness is a tiny tiny part of real


---------81:42----------
meditative tradition and so generally


---------81:45----------
speaking mindfulness and the mindfulness


---------81:46----------
based techniques are very very safe and


---------81:49----------
have a low likelihood don't lead to


---------81:51----------
psychosis


---------81:52----------
if you go and actually learn Kundalini


---------81:55----------
Yoga and things like that from a real


---------81:56----------
teacher I'm not talking about going to a


---------81:57----------
yoga studio down the street


---------81:59----------
doing awesome that's not real I mean


---------82:01----------
it's the first step of Kundalini Yoga


---------82:03----------
it's that it's kind of like a Kundalini


---------82:06----------
Yoga is like stretching before a


---------82:09----------
marathon


---------82:09----------
like what you learn at the yoga studio


---------82:10----------
is is like stretching before a marathon


---------82:12----------
it's not actually the practice it's the


---------82:14----------
preparation for true Kundalini Yoga but


---------82:18----------
so what's the so the first thing is that


---------82:20----------
psychosis is possible and so you


---------82:22----------
shouldn't do like hardcore meditation


---------82:24----------
without the guidance of a Buddha okay so


---------82:26----------
you should have a teacher who really


---------82:28----------
understands this stuff and then they can


---------82:30----------
teach you but anything you do at a yoga


---------82:32----------
studio is fine anything you do with a


---------82:33----------
nap is fine anything I teach you is


---------82:35----------
probably fine um I tend to teach more


---------82:37----------
advanced techniques than most people


---------82:39----------
like I do teach like so this this


---------82:41----------
technique for example is actually a


---------82:43----------
Kundalini Yoga technique but it's very


---------82:45----------
mild basically and so how can you


---------82:49----------
predict the risk I'd say it so your


---------82:50----------
overall stability so remember that like


---------82:52----------
yoga is intended to be practiced by


---------82:54----------
people who are purified right so these


---------82:57----------
are people who are truthful they don't


---------82:59----------
lie they're not necessarily celibate but


---------83:02----------
they're not lustful they're a lot of the


---------83:05----------
most of the time they're vegetarian


---------83:06----------
right so you're like a very like pure


---------83:08----------
person so like if you're having trouble


---------83:10----------
with like addictions or anger or


---------83:12----------
depression or anxiety like you're not


---------83:14----------
really ready for deep yoga practice or


---------83:17----------
meditation techniques so I'd say that


---------83:19----------
like the way that you predict risk is


---------83:21----------
based on the stability of a person so I


---------83:24----------
had a patient once who was very very


---------83:25----------
depressed and they wanted to go on a


---------83:28----------
10-day silent meditation retreat because


---------83:29----------
they thought that like through this


---------83:31----------
intensive meditation they would get like


---------83:33----------
a high dose of meditation and their


---------83:34----------
depression will be cured there's a


---------83:36----------
chance that that can happen but there's


---------83:38----------
also like that's the recipe for


---------83:39----------
psychosis because when you get someone


---------83:42----------
who is ill or unwell or not at peace


---------83:44----------
with themselves and then you give them a


---------83:47----------
very very high dose of meditation and


---------83:49----------
they're gonna run into problems it's


---------83:51----------
kind of like taking someone who is


---------83:52----------
untrained and swimming and dumping them


---------83:54----------
in the ocean like they're just not ready


---------83:57----------
for it they might learn to swim but then


---------83:59----------
my drone as well so absolutely right so


---------84:02----------
they it's absolutely sink or swim so I


---------84:04----------
I'd say you know start with this start


---------84:07----------
with the small stuff and then get to the


---------84:09----------
more extreme or esoteric stuff when


---------84:11----------
you're ready in health


---------84:12----------
and then a teacher supposedly will


---------84:14----------
present themselves when you're ready


---------84:15----------
okay great question thanks backs out


---------84:21----------
great day oh this is my son yeah okay


---------84:27----------
this was my first webinar and really


---------84:31----------
thoroughly enjoyed what you forgive me


---------84:34----------
for my naive language but so I invested


---------84:37----------
my focus in the lecture that you just


---------84:40----------
gave now and my question is sort of


---------84:44----------
branching out of that so I believe that


---------84:47----------
meditation is something as a state of


---------84:50----------
mind or whatsoever where you can


---------84:51----------
understand and also salt right and to


---------84:55----------
understand is to recognize problems I


---------84:58----------
saw a question in chat which branched


---------85:00----------
this question out of me which is like


---------85:02----------
okay do you have a mantra for decision


---------85:04----------
decision-making so what I was what I'm


---------85:08----------
trying to say is I believe that


---------85:09----------
meditation is the kind of state where


---------85:11----------
you can question your own


---------85:14----------
decision-making and question the source


---------85:17----------
of your own insecurities and is it how


---------85:22----------
do you derive it down to a mantra or


---------85:24----------
practice to solve that what you're


---------85:29----------
recognizing is that yes all right let me


---------85:33----------
ask you something you said that you


---------85:34----------
believe meditation is what so I think


---------85:37----------
meditation as a box with a question mark


---------85:41----------
on it is something that allows you to


---------85:44----------
understand and also something that


---------85:46----------
allows you to solve now what your


---------85:48----------
understanding is probably your own


---------85:50----------
insecurities or something about your


---------85:53----------
impulses for decision making so let's


---------85:55----------
let's start with this critique have you


---------85:57----------
been in the box state Oh


---------86:00----------
possibly it's hard to say okay so the


---------86:05----------
first thing is that is that so your your


---------86:07----------
question comes from a foundation that


---------86:10----------
that box state is a particular thing so


---------86:14----------
until you know what the Box state is the


---------86:17----------
rest of your questions are logical kind


---------86:20----------
of like you're building this on a


---------86:22----------
foundation of what you believe a


---------86:24----------
meditative state is


---------86:25----------
right right so unless that assumption is


---------86:29----------
correct or incorrect the rest of your


---------86:32----------
what you're saying becomes relevant or


---------86:34----------
irrelevant


---------86:35----------
yeah does that make sense yeah yeah so I


---------86:38----------
think the first step is to get to the


---------86:41----------
box state and figure out whether your


---------86:43----------
fundamental assumption is correct or


---------86:44----------
incorrect like I agree with how you


---------86:47----------
described the Box state as you drew it


---------86:51----------
right now I could fully correlate and


---------86:54----------
understand how cutting out attention in


---------86:58----------
certain aspects increases is another way


---------87:01----------
and then you reach this meditative state


---------87:03----------
of mind which allows you to sit down and


---------87:06----------
focus on one thing and sort of like you


---------87:08----------
know the way I narrow it down to myself


---------87:11----------
is I always think of it as a it's like


---------87:15----------
you're running towards a balance of what


---------87:18----------
to internalize and externalize that's if


---------87:22----------
I just say it in one line that's how I


---------87:24----------
say to myself okay so what's your


---------87:26----------
question right so my thing is how do you


---------87:30----------
derive of what is a suit suitable mantra


---------87:34----------
or a practice based on what you can


---------87:37----------
figure out is a possible insecurity yeah


---------87:41----------
so I think that there - - a couple of


---------87:45----------
things so the first thing is that I


---------87:46----------
think something about your conception I


---------87:48----------
kind of disagree with which is why I'm


---------87:50----------
saying you have to start by actually


---------87:51----------
getting to the statement and the reason


---------87:54----------
I say that is because actually like in


---------87:56----------
my experience you don't need a mantra if


---------88:00----------
you can get to the state so if you can


---------88:04----------
get to the state then the insecurity


---------88:06----------
starts to dissolve on its own more in


---------88:11----------
the state a month or will be revealed to


---------88:13----------
you that you can use to kind of


---------88:15----------
consciously dissolve it the purpose of a


---------88:18----------
mantra is this because it's given by


---------88:19----------
someone who has been to the state to


---------88:23----------
someone who has not been to the state


---------88:25----------
and it helps that person because it's


---------88:27----------
kind of like formulaic and a protocol to


---------88:29----------
in a month absolutely yeah all right so


---------88:32----------
that's why mantra is given by like a


---------88:34----------
teacher to a disciple because the


---------88:37----------
disciple hasn't been to where the


---------88:38----------
teacher has been because


---------88:39----------
once you get to the where the teachers


---------88:41----------
you don't need the month or anymore so


---------88:45----------
if you're talking about following the


---------88:47----------
discipline of to recognize it for


---------88:49----------
yourself sort of like a well it's it's


---------88:52----------
either over right so one thing is if you


---------88:54----------
have a particular in secular two paths


---------88:56----------
one is that if you have an insecurity


---------88:59----------
you do like yoga and meditation and if


---------89:01----------
you meditate long enough you're gonna


---------89:02----------
get to the state and the problem is


---------89:04----------
gonna be fixed on itself just getting to


---------89:06----------
that state will free you from the


---------89:08----------
problem and that's what we see right


---------89:10----------
like what like so I know that sounds


---------89:12----------
absolutely bizarre but like we have


---------89:14----------
clinical evidence of this so you take a


---------89:16----------
hundred people with anxiety all of their


---------89:18----------
anxieties are different you teach them


---------89:22----------
up meditation protocol and eight weeks


---------89:24----------
later their anxiety is clinically


---------89:26----------
significant there's a statistically


---------89:29----------
significant clinical improvement so how


---------89:31----------
does that work it's not a specific month


---------89:34----------
or for each of their anxieties or


---------89:36----------
insecurities by getting closer and


---------89:38----------
closer to the Box state it dissolves the


---------89:41----------
root of anxiety so that the particular


---------89:43----------
insecurities actually becomes completely


---------89:45----------
irrelevant


---------89:45----------
mm-hmm right but that's that's my point


---------89:49----------
and we were if you go back and you watch


---------89:50----------
the anxiety lecture you'll see that that


---------89:53----------
anxiety has a root so if you get into


---------89:55----------
the box say you don't need a mantra


---------89:56----------
because you're dealing with it on its


---------89:58----------
own the purpose of a mantra is if you're


---------90:01----------
unable to get to a box state or you want


---------90:03----------
to an acceleration towards a particular


---------90:05----------
box state no no that's a little bit of


---------90:08----------
an oxymoron but then you're you're given


---------90:11----------
a month or up by someone who's more


---------90:12----------
spiritually knowledgeable than you and


---------90:14----------
then it kind of accelerates you in that


---------90:16----------
way hmm does that answer your question


---------90:19----------
so you're gonna go either way it's just


---------90:22----------
them you know you can target a security


---------90:25----------
as in security specifically and if you


---------90:28----------
want to target it specifically you


---------90:29----------
basically need a teacher who will tell


---------90:32----------
you how to dissolve that right so that


---------90:34----------
teacher doesn't have to be a spiritual


---------90:35----------
teacher that's what psychologists do -


---------90:37----------
is it knowledge yourself - yeah


---------90:41----------
absolutely


---------90:42----------
but if you want to teach yourself then


---------90:44----------
you don't use a month or how you use the


---------90:46----------
yoga path and then you'll teach yourself


---------90:48----------
hmm


---------90:49----------
okay yes thanks very much much respect


---------90:52----------
take care thank you all right we're


---------90:55----------
gonna get a couple other we'll do one


---------90:57----------
more question so first person I'm


---------90:59----------
inviting Ryan Lucca and Tristan and Lisi


---------91:14----------
so let's see if we can get someone else


---------91:17----------
will do like one or two more questions


---------91:19----------
okay Simon with us


---------91:45----------
okay so we're inviting more people great


---------91:51----------
Lisi has joined the room fantastic


---------91:55----------
so it'll probably take him a second -


---------91:57----------
hey can you hear me


---------91:59----------
you're not gonna you yeah let's see go


---------92:01----------
for it okay so little problems with


---------92:05----------
meditation as a whole


---------92:06----------
okay about five about I would say like I


---------92:10----------
guess like I try to do it like in the


---------92:12----------
middle of the day because I'm not very


---------92:13----------
good in the mornings my body's a very


---------92:15----------
unstable so I do roundabouts noonish


---------92:19----------
maybe one o'clock here should maybe


---------92:21----------
after lunch and I know we get like three


---------92:23----------
minutes into it and then for some reason


---------92:26----------
my chest like feels a lot stress and


---------92:28----------
it's my body forcibly tries to pull me


---------92:31----------
out of it sure and I and that is and


---------92:37----------
maybe a weights like like way like like


---------92:41----------
I deal with that all snoring any history


---------92:45----------
of trauma um my bra


---------92:49----------
they trauma say history prom oh yeah


---------92:55----------
just like a yeah yeah oh I've tons yeah


---------92:58----------
so that's a very common experience for


---------93:00----------
people who have a history of trauma yeah


---------93:02----------
so let me explain to you so I think


---------93:04----------
listen your solution is gonna be in the


---------93:06----------
kind of meditation technique that you do


---------93:08----------
okay so let's understand what happens in


---------93:10----------
the mind with trauma yes so when you


---------93:13----------
have a traumatic event your mind tries


---------93:14----------
to protect you from it yes and the way


---------93:17----------
it protects you from it is by putting


---------93:19----------
like you know like pressure plates like


---------93:22----------
or like putting a bunch of weight on top


---------93:24----------
of the trauma to push it down oh okay


---------93:26----------
okay so when you do meditation yeah as


---------93:29----------
you open your mind and you relax you


---------93:33----------
know all of that pressure that's keeping


---------93:35----------
your trauma at bay relaxes and then the


---------93:38----------
Trop astronomers leaking out yes and


---------93:41----------
then so like as you do like mindfulness


---------93:44----------
like what kind of matter you do like


---------93:45----------
mindfulness meditation I've been


---------93:47----------
mindfulness have been third i I've done


---------93:49----------
chakrams I've done sound I've done I've


---------93:52----------
done one we once we have to use certain


---------93:55----------
like I've done body scans I've done


---------93:57----------
visualization so done


---------93:59----------
those are you have a different like


---------94:02----------
three meditations that seem to work the


---------94:04----------
best almost like the body scanner I got


---------94:07----------
inside like but like at least five


---------94:08----------
minutes I didn't the other pull down


---------94:09----------
with go usually you're gonna talk


---------94:11----------
there's actually so this is something


---------94:13----------
where what I'm about to say actually has


---------94:15----------
good scientific evidence to support okay


---------94:17----------
so the first thing to understand is that


---------94:19----------
your mind is trying to keep the trauma


---------94:20----------
at bay and gel so you do something like


---------94:22----------
an open awareness meditation like


---------94:24----------
mindfulness where you just let whatever


---------94:27----------
is in your mind like flood about right


---------94:29----------
so trauma people who have trauma I do


---------94:32----------
not teach the mindfulness because I


---------94:34----------
think mindfulness is a bad thing to


---------94:35----------
teach I dried it once and let see my my


---------94:38----------
head is lateesha shaking look at it


---------94:42----------
again if you look at the meditation


---------94:44----------
techniques so there's something called


---------94:45----------
dialectical behavioral therapy don't I


---------94:48----------
have to go the dialect of dialectical


---------94:51----------
behavioral therapy is a modification of


---------94:53----------
cognitive behavioral therapy that


---------94:55----------
includes quarter quote mindfulness so


---------94:58----------
this is an avid the best evidence-based


---------95:00----------
treatment for something called


---------95:02----------
borderline personality disorder and most


---------95:05----------
people who have borderline personality


---------95:07----------
disorder have trauma early in their life


---------95:09----------
yes this is the best scientific


---------95:12----------
treatment for people as so you can sort


---------95:15----------
of do a little bit of a hop skip and a


---------95:17----------
jump to say this is the best scientific


---------95:19----------
this is a scientifically validated


---------95:22----------
meditation regimen for people who have a


---------95:23----------
history of trauma and if you look at


---------95:25----------
their corner quote mindfulness


---------95:27----------
techniques they're actually not open


---------95:29----------
awareness Zen techniques they're very


---------95:31----------
sensory grounding techniques so what


---------95:34----------
they actually do is it's not open


---------95:36----------
awareness where you're watching your


---------95:37----------
mind and you're emptying your mind their


---------95:39----------
mind is actually very focused on a


---------95:41----------
particular sensation or bodily


---------95:44----------
experience yeah I found I found one of


---------95:46----------
focusing on like this I've been doing


---------95:48----------
sound meditation like yeah three times


---------95:50----------
this week and it's been doing better


---------95:52----------
than any other mentation have done what


---------95:56----------
you need to do Lisi is not empty your


---------95:58----------
mind no indoor meditation techniques


---------96:01----------
should not empty your mind at all they


---------96:03----------
should be dominated by one thing and on


---------96:06----------
how as they get dominated by that one


---------96:08----------
thing because you know if you dominate


---------96:10----------
your mind with one thing the trauma


---------96:12----------
is gonna stay at bay okay $0.10 resumix


---------96:16----------
empty your mind your mind is gonna be a


---------96:19----------
vacuum and the trauma is gonna come


---------96:21----------
rushing in because of the negative


---------96:22----------
pressure in your mind is this gonna fill


---------96:24----------
the void absolutely so mindful


---------96:26----------
techniques are not good for you so buy


---------96:28----------
skins so physical techniques are gonna


---------96:30----------
be the absolute best okay so like body


---------96:34----------
scanning is good Yoga is gonna be


---------96:35----------
excellent for you your imagination


---------96:38----------
the Yungas moon brilliance absolutely


---------96:40----------
right so your meditation should be yoga


---------96:43----------
so when we do yoga together and I tell


---------96:45----------
you to like focus on the present like


---------96:47----------
that's where your that foundation of


---------96:49----------
your meditation and then as you get more


---------96:52----------
comfortable with that then you can start


---------96:54----------
rolling in breath techniques but also


---------96:56----------
breath techniques that are very rigorous


---------96:58----------
so your brother so much here like the


---------97:00----------
trunk monk to try one we like triphasic


---------97:02----------
breathing yes so that so all of your


---------97:05----------
meditation should demand mental


---------97:07----------
concentration because if you let your


---------97:09----------
mind relax trauma is gonna come rushing


---------97:11----------
out got it yep really can you hear me no


---------97:19----------
yeah listen you does that answer your


---------97:20----------
question


---------97:21----------
that's absolute perfect okay awesome a


---------97:24----------
been pulled out of my meditation like


---------97:26----------
every often you watching you don't want


---------97:28----------
to keep the trauma at bay and then over


---------97:30----------
time you learn how to let a little bit


---------97:32----------
of it leak out in doses they can handle


---------97:34----------
but your mind will handle that for you


---------97:36----------
okay you don't have to worry about it


---------97:38----------
okay that's perfect my mom take care man


---------97:40----------
good luck yeah okay Simon okay okay yeah


---------97:45----------
so my question is actually also related


---------97:48----------
to trauma I'm like I think the main


---------97:53----------
point of my question is how like like


---------97:55----------
complying this Eastern stuff that you're


---------97:57----------
teaching us with the traditional Western


---------97:59----------
therapy that takes place because I also


---------98:02----------
I have like si PTSD and so basically my


---------98:08----------
like I'm because I'm like still waiting


---------98:11----------
in queue to get into therapy I don't


---------98:14----------
know like it will be several months I'm


---------98:15----------
actually doing a sort of like self


---------98:17----------
exposure at home so I'll be like writing


---------98:19----------
about the traumatic event or I'll be


---------98:21----------
like speaking it out loud in a recorder


---------98:24----------
so


---------98:25----------
like trying to do within like small


---------98:27----------
doses so my question is like how do I


---------98:29----------
combine like this self exposure stuff


---------98:31----------
that I'm doing with you know maybe like


---------98:35----------
sometimes some type of meditation or


---------98:37----------
some type of yoga to like just heal the


---------98:42----------
traumas faster or more rapidly or


---------98:44----------
whatever yeah so I think that question


---------98:47----------
you know I mean I can I'm gonna sort of


---------98:51----------
partially answer it so the short answer


---------98:53----------
is that like if you want to combine in a


---------98:55----------
clinical way meditation or yoga practice


---------98:57----------
with Western therapy which is like


---------99:00----------
literally what I do in my day job it


---------99:02----------
needs to be with like an actual mental


---------99:06----------
health clinician right so like a mental


---------99:09----------
health clinician has to evaluate you and


---------99:13----------
then sort of tell you what they think is


---------99:15----------
going to be good or not good chances are


---------99:17----------
that the clinician that you meet is not


---------99:19----------
going to be very knowledgeable about


---------99:20----------
this Eastern stuff because those people


---------99:22----------
are few and far between yeah um and so


---------99:25----------
the core your question about how to


---------99:26----------
combine things so remember that


---------99:27----------
combining things involves Western stuff


---------99:29----------
with Eastern stuff and the Western stuff


---------99:31----------
actually has to be performed by a


---------99:33----------
clinician you got that yeah any


---------99:37----------
discussion of combining these two is is


---------99:39----------
like it's gonna be incomplete until you


---------99:42----------
see a mental health professional okay so


---------99:45----------
yeah so you're basically saying that I


---------99:48----------
like like there is no combination where


---------99:51----------
they meet in the middle it's basically


---------99:53----------
like two wholes meeting well no I'm


---------99:56----------
saying that you can't know where that


---------99:58----------
combination is because you haven't done


---------99:59----------
the Western piece yet okay okay right so


---------100:03----------
you're waiting to see the therapist so


---------100:05----------
how can I tell you how they're gonna


---------100:06----------
combine if you have if you don't know


---------100:08----------
what the Western piece looks like okay


---------100:10----------
yeah well I like I dunno some like you


---------100:13----------
you are correct that it's like better to


---------100:16----------
do is supervised because you don't know


---------100:18----------
what else might happen to you like


---------100:19----------
breakdowns or whatever mental breakdowns


---------100:21----------
but like I've sort of like yeah just I


---------100:25----------
just got like a quick review of what


---------100:27----------
we're supposed to do and it's like


---------100:28----------
basically meet speaking aloud about the


---------100:30----------
trauma and then recording myself and


---------100:32----------
then listening to my own recording and


---------100:34----------
like doing that and basically just


---------100:36----------
repeating the story until like I can get


---------100:39----------
like from 0 to 100 I'm like at a level


---------100:42----------
of like 30 in terms of discomfort where


---------100:44----------
I'm not comfortable Simon okay so I'm


---------100:47----------
gonna answer more of your question but


---------100:49----------
let's just start by saying so I


---------100:50----------
understand that you read about what the


---------100:53----------
therapy looks like and you started the


---------100:55----------
process of doing it on your own I don't


---------100:57----------
know if that's a good idea or a bad idea


---------100:58----------
because generally speaking in my


---------101:00----------
experience therapists add something to


---------101:04----------
the equation right like I don't know how


---------101:06----------
else to put that but like I mean people


---------101:09----------
can grow it like so the majority of


---------101:10----------
people deal with the majority of their


---------101:12----------
problems without a therapist people deal


---------101:14----------
with anxiety and insecurities and low


---------101:16----------
self confidence and depression like the


---------101:18----------
average human being deals with all kinds


---------101:20----------
of stuff all the time


---------101:22----------
therapists add something to that


---------101:24----------
equation so I don't know if it is a good


---------101:26----------
idea or a bad idea or I can't gauge the


---------101:28----------
efficacy of you doing this stuff on your


---------101:30----------
own generally speaking I'm a big fan of


---------101:33----------
you being reflective and trying to grow


---------101:35----------
as a human being but like what I'm


---------101:37----------
saying is that you're asking how do I


---------101:39----------
combine eastern and western stuff and


---------101:41----------
what I'm saying is that you don't really


---------101:42----------
know what the Western piece is yet right


---------101:45----------
you can lead about it you can read about


---------101:47----------
it but like reading a book on therapy


---------101:49----------
techniques is very different from


---------101:51----------
actually being a subject in therapy does


---------101:54----------
that make sense yeah I mean there is


---------101:57----------
there is still a difference I I didn't


---------102:00----------
actually read about it but the


---------102:02----------
difference you're talking about remains


---------102:03----------
because I haven't been a patient but


---------102:05----------
like the the knowledge that I'm applying


---------102:07----------
myself at home is actually just a quick


---------102:09----------
review I they received from the


---------102:10----------
therapists like I gotta read it online


---------102:12----------
like EJ just told me you're gonna wait


---------102:14----------
in a queue and when you arrive this is


---------102:15----------
that stuff we're going on doing so I'm


---------102:17----------
not I'm not saying that what you're


---------102:19----------
doing is bad like I can you know let


---------102:22----------
your your therapist that you're gonna


---------102:24----------
see eventually know that you're doing


---------102:26----------
this but my point is your question was


---------102:28----------
how do I combine Western and Eastern and


---------102:30----------
my first point that I'm making to you is


---------102:32----------
that you don't actually have the Eastern


---------102:34----------
peace filled in yet okay it's okay so


---------102:37----------
can we just the like it can I make a


---------102:40----------
concrete example so let's say I'm like


---------102:42----------
yes


---------102:42----------
no no so dude yeah I don't I just I just


---------102:48----------
want you to understand that


---------102:51----------
if you want a comprehensive Western


---------102:53----------
Eastern treatment plan for your trauma I


---------102:55----------
want you to acknowledge because I don't


---------102:57----------
think we're on seeing eye to eye here


---------102:59----------
that you have not started Western


---------103:01----------
therapy yet okay so you're basically


---------103:03----------
like I think like if I'm reading your


---------103:05----------
mind correctly like you're viewing me a


---------103:07----------
bit too reckless you want me to slow


---------103:09----------
down a bit no no I'm not viewing you as


---------103:10----------
reckless I have a second part to my


---------103:12----------
answer I'm just trying to get like I'm


---------103:15----------
trying to get on the same page about


---------103:16----------
where you are right okay yes I wasn't


---------103:20----------
you want me to acknowledge that I know


---------103:23----------
that's what I'm doing is more of an


---------103:24----------
experimentation and that I should be


---------103:26----------
more patient and received the whole


---------103:27----------
story from my therapist not that you


---------103:30----------
should do anything I agree with you that


---------103:32----------
it's experimental okay what I'm saying


---------103:34----------
is that when you so you're asking me how


---------103:36----------
do I compile and combine Western and


---------103:38----------
Eastern treatment right that's your


---------103:40----------
question


---------103:40----------
can you yeah yeah right so what I'm


---------103:44----------
saying is that like the western part of


---------103:46----------
your treatment has not really begun or


---------103:48----------
is not completely begun yet hmm you see


---------103:52----------
what I'm saying so if in my answer to


---------103:54----------
you we have to acknowledge that the


---------103:56----------
Western treatment hasn't fully started


---------103:59----------
yet yeah right so now I'm going to give


---------104:03----------
you the Eastern proper what I'm saying


---------104:05----------
is that you can't like if if I let's say


---------104:08----------
that I say like how do I combine like a


---------104:09----------
pizza party with a barbecue and then you


---------104:13----------
can say like okay I've like I have


---------104:14----------
breadsticks from the pizza party but I


---------104:16----------
don't have the pizza and we're gonna


---------104:18----------
we're about to talk to the barbecue but


---------104:19----------
like you haven't actually started


---------104:21----------
treatment with a therapist yeah hmm so


---------104:23----------
combining these two is going to evolve


---------104:25----------
once you actually start treatment with a


---------104:28----------
therapist that's all I'm trying to say


---------104:29----------
okay okay yeah right so I'm not saying


---------104:33----------
you're doing something bad like that's


---------104:34----------
between you and your therapist like if


---------104:36----------
he gave you stuff to review and you're


---------104:37----------
reviewing it and you're finding it


---------104:38----------
helpful by all means go for it it's not


---------104:40----------
my place to say what you should or


---------104:42----------
shouldn't do it's not my place to


---------104:43----------
comment about whether this is a good


---------104:45----------
idea or a bad idea


---------104:46----------
you're asking me question about how to


---------104:47----------
combine Western treatment and Eastern


---------104:49----------
treatment and I just want you to


---------104:51----------
understand that you can't combine those


---------104:53----------
two until you start Western treatment


---------104:56----------
okay okay so yeah yeah yeah I understand


---------105:01----------
but like but


---------105:03----------
you can't combine something that you you


---------105:05----------
can't combine until you have two things


---------105:07----------
and you actually have the western piece


---------105:09----------
yes okay so let's say let's say it's not


---------105:11----------
okay so can I like just reformulate my


---------105:13----------
question quickly so let's just say


---------105:15----------
because I journal like a lot like I


---------105:17----------
write about uncomfortable memories or


---------105:19----------
like and this is not like part of my


---------105:20----------
therapy necessarily it's just like a


---------105:22----------
habit of act up which will help me so


---------105:24----------
let's say I like journal about a bad


---------105:26----------
memory like or just journal like about


---------105:29----------
something that makes me uncomfortable in


---------105:31----------
the moment like how do I like okay


---------105:34----------
assuming that this is not the whole


---------105:36----------
western part of it but just like a small


---------105:38----------
part so how do I like after journaling


---------105:41----------
something like should ie like do


---------105:43----------
meditation just so I remain with those


---------105:45----------
uncomfortable memories like you know


---------105:47----------
what I mean like yes so that that was


---------105:50----------
the answer that I've been trying to get


---------105:51----------
to okay so my short answer for you Simon


---------105:55----------
is that much like the last guy you


---------105:57----------
should do primarily physical techniques


---------106:00----------
and I don't know so when I work with


---------106:02----------
people like I actually combine the


---------106:04----------
Western and Eastern so based on the


---------106:06----------
content of your journal or how often you


---------106:09----------
feel physical sensations or what kind of


---------106:11----------
physical sensations you feel I will give


---------106:13----------
people specific meditation regimens or


---------106:15----------
yoga regimens so whether it's a


---------106:17----------
tightness in the throat having this in


---------106:19----------
the chest or a pit in your stomach or


---------106:21----------
constriction in your stomach tension in


---------106:23----------
your shoulders all of those things in my


---------106:26----------
experience as a therapist I will use


---------106:28----------
different techniques for so the nature


---------106:30----------
of their trauma and what we uncovered in


---------106:32----------
therapy leads to a different kind of


---------106:35----------
specificity of meditation technique and


---------106:37----------
that's why I was trying to emphasize


---------106:39----------
Yorkshire I haven't started therapy yet


---------106:40----------
so that's fine not saying what you're


---------106:42----------
doing is good or bad now your question


---------106:44----------
is how do I use Eastern stuff to


---------106:46----------
accelerate the process or supplement my


---------106:48----------
progress and my growth and my healing


---------106:51----------
which i think is a great question


---------106:53----------
I mean the short answer is since you


---------106:55----------
have a history of trauma I'd say that


---------106:56----------
you should do things that are heavily


---------106:58----------
like Earth start with things that are


---------106:59----------
physically oriented just like the last


---------107:01----------
guy because we can we know from studies


---------107:04----------
on PTSD or not so they're also like


---------107:07----------
things like EMDR for example which are


---------107:09----------
very intensive donnas and evidence-based


---------107:12----------
treatments for PTSD so it's sort of eye


---------107:14----------
movement desensitization


---------107:17----------
which is kinda sad it's essentially


---------107:18----------
adharma but like essentially you want to


---------107:21----------
focus on one sense or your body and you


---------107:24----------
want to use that to fill your mind


---------107:26----------
because if your mind is completely empty


---------107:28----------
then their trauma is going to come


---------107:30----------
rushing back now in your case it sounds


---------107:33----------
like you're doing a lot of reflection on


---------107:35----------
your trauma so I would say there are


---------107:37----------
other kinds of techniques that may


---------107:38----------
benefit you more but I still think I'm


---------107:41----------
not recommending these but I think like


---------107:43----------
bass I think if we had four hours to


---------107:45----------
work together I'm pretty sure or not I'm


---------107:47----------
not pretty sure I would imagine based on


---------107:50----------
what you're telling me right now that I


---------107:51----------
would probably give you some kind of


---------107:53----------
like intuition or knowledge techniques


---------107:56----------
because it sounds like you're actually


---------107:57----------
able to sit with your trauma so I'm


---------107:59----------
already which is different from listen


---------108:01----------
and if you're able to sit with it


---------108:03----------
getting some perspective through like


---------108:04----------
more knowledge oriented techniques like


---------108:07----------
third eye techniques and charging the


---------108:08----------
laser beam and stuff like that I think


---------108:10----------
could help you but I think the safest


---------108:11----------
answer and the most evidence-based


---------108:14----------
answer is to do essentially bodily


---------108:17----------
techniques or techniques that are


---------108:18----------
focused very grounding on a particular


---------108:21----------
sense or in your body okay so just to


---------108:24----------
like summarize what you've said like


---------108:25----------
physical techniques so I keep the trauma


---------108:28----------
at bay so it doesn't like overwhelm me


---------108:30----------
well if I'm more comfortable to sit with


---------108:32----------
the trauma I will do intuition or


---------108:34----------
knowledge techniques yeah but okay so


---------108:37----------
that aren't I definitely do not think


---------108:39----------
you should explore on your own okay so


---------108:42----------
either it's a meditation teacher or a


---------108:45----------
competent therapist or ideally both


---------108:47----------
okay got it yeah so I saw and then


---------108:51----------
you're not gonna answer so then you're


---------108:54----------
not gonna answer my next question of


---------108:55----------
where I can find intuition and knowledge


---------108:57----------
techniques no I mean I'm happy to answer


---------109:00----------
it the short answer is when when when


---------109:02----------
you're ready for them someone will


---------109:04----------
present themselves to teach it to you


---------109:05----------
right so I got a bigger an awesome here


---------109:09----------
assignment is that you're impatient yeah


---------109:13----------
I think so that's the biggest problem


---------109:15----------
and so we can talk about well I can


---------109:17----------
answer as many questions as you want to


---------109:18----------
but you need to learn how to take this


---------109:20----------
slow that's the most important thing to


---------109:22----------
deal with trauma you got to take it so


---------109:24----------
you can't fix it overnight so strong by


---------109:26----------
doing yoga and it's very unsatisfying


---------109:28----------
because so this is I see


---------109:30----------
a lot where people who have liked have


---------109:33----------
histories of trauma or bad depression


---------109:34----------
they want something very intensive


---------109:37----------
because they want to get better way


---------109:38----------
faster which is completely reasonable


---------109:40----------
because you've been suffering for a long


---------109:42----------
time unfortunately how much you want to


---------109:45----------
get better and how quickly you want to


---------109:47----------
get better doesn't change the healing


---------109:48----------
process if I break a leg and I want to


---------109:52----------
get back to playing soccer what is like


---------109:55----------
just because I want to get back to


---------109:57----------
playing soccer super super bad what does


---------109:59----------
that mean about my leg healing process


---------110:01----------
my brother will heal in his stone time


---------110:04----------
exactly and the mind is no different so


---------110:09----------
just because you want to try Slyke you


---------110:10----------
can't accelerate the healing process of


---------110:12----------
your leg you can definitely do something


---------110:14----------
to support it you can do some things to


---------110:16----------
accelerate it but most of it has to


---------110:18----------
happen kind of on its own and so the


---------110:21----------
biggest thing that you need is patience


---------110:22----------
go ahead and start doing yoga do yoga


---------110:24----------
every day for half an hour it's gonna be


---------110:26----------
good for you okay and then you'll be


---------110:29----------
prepared for therapy if you do if you


---------110:33----------
start doing yoga today three months from


---------110:35----------
now or six months from now when you see


---------110:36----------
your therapist your body in your mind


---------110:38----------
will be in a different state and you'll


---------110:40----------
be able to actually like do therapy in a


---------110:42----------
much more powerful way okay okay yeah


---------110:47----------
okay good luck man bye


---------110:50----------

---------110:54----------
