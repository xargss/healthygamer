---------00:00----------
when i don't deserve something and it


---------00:02----------
happens


---------00:03----------
anyway it reprograms


---------00:06----------
my understanding of what is deserved and


---------00:09----------
what is not deserved


---------00:11----------
and then i carry that programming


---------00:13----------
through life


---------00:14----------
which is where you carry the identity of


---------00:16----------
shame


---------00:18----------
would dr k make a video about shame i've


---------00:21----------
recently come to realize that my social


---------00:23----------
anxiety and low self-esteem is rooted


---------00:25----------
in a core of feeling of shame and not


---------00:28----------
the circumstances around me i say


---------00:30----------
feeling because


---------00:32----------
as much as it is a belief i am bad it's


---------00:34----------
also


---------00:35----------
an this overwhelming sensation that


---------00:37----------
seems to hijack my life


---------00:40----------
i can't remember much about my childhood


---------00:42----------
so it is hard to identify if this


---------00:44----------
is something that was learned but i felt


---------00:46----------
this way my whole life


---------00:48----------
therapy has been slow but helpful but my


---------00:50----------
therapist


---------00:51----------
seems to focus mostly on a cvt driven


---------00:53----------
approach


---------00:54----------
the problem with this is that i struggle


---------00:56----------
with an overwhelming emotion sensation


---------00:58----------
and not so much a thought


---------01:01----------
feeling shame makes me feel even more


---------01:03----------
ashamed


---------01:05----------
you know this is why this is why shame


---------01:08----------
is the elite mob


---------01:09----------
of emotions it's really the best emotion


---------01:12----------
that makes you feel more of the emotion


---------01:15----------
and when the shame gets bad enough it


---------01:17----------
leads to anger hatred self-sabotage and


---------01:19----------
inability to hold relationships that is


---------01:21----------
right


---------01:22----------
um things that i'm curious about how


---------01:24----------
core


---------01:25----------
shame becomes implanted in our minds and


---------01:27----------
what it really is


---------01:29----------
if understanding the origins of our


---------01:31----------
shame can help us overcome it and if so


---------01:33----------
how


---------01:34----------
notable physiological patterns that


---------01:36----------
might serve as helpful tools to overcome


---------01:39----------
shame meditative approaches this has


---------01:41----------
been a slow grind for me and one of the


---------01:43----------
biggest things that


---------01:44----------
keeps me going is listening to dr k


---------01:46----------
break down these topics


---------01:48----------
okay thank you and take care you are


---------01:51----------
very welcome and thank you for posting


---------01:53----------
i think friends it is teaching time can


---------01:56----------
you all hold on a second


---------01:57----------
i'd like to blame my children but today


---------01:59----------
i have only myself to blame


---------02:01----------
so let's talk about shame so you know


---------02:03----------
i'll ask i'll say things like


---------02:04----------
become aware of it notice it notice what


---------02:07----------
you feel see where the hurt is coming


---------02:08----------
from


---------02:10----------
so i want you all to pay attention to


---------02:11----------
this sentence first i've recently come


---------02:13----------
to realize that my social anxiety and


---------02:14----------
low self-esteem is rooted in a core


---------02:16----------
feeling of shame


---------02:17----------
and not the circumstances around me this


---------02:20----------
is a huge step forward okay


---------02:22----------
and this is why i think this person is


---------02:23----------
already getting better because they've


---------02:25----------
come to realize


---------02:27----------
that what shame so shame is tricky okay


---------02:29----------
so the first thing to understand about


---------02:31----------
shame is that it's a tricky tricky


---------02:32----------
tricky tricky tricky one the first thing


---------02:36----------
with shame is that shame comes from


---------02:39----------
within


---------02:40----------
but it's sneaky sneaky one because


---------02:44----------
it tricks you into thinking it comes


---------02:47----------
from outside


---------02:48----------
so this is the first thing to understand


---------02:50----------
about shane


---------02:52----------
and this actually is the the thing that


---------02:54----------
leads to the most stumbling


---------02:56----------
because if i assume that shame


---------02:59----------
is coming from the outside then the


---------03:01----------
solution is on the outside but like so


---------03:04----------
let's say like


---------03:05----------
you know let's say once again like an


---------03:06----------
abusive relationship okay so if i'm in


---------03:08----------
an abusive relationship with someone


---------03:10----------
who's emotionally abusive and makes me


---------03:11----------
feel ashamed of myself


---------03:13----------
what i will wind up doing is trying to


---------03:16----------
appease that person


---------03:18----------
because that person kind of controls the


---------03:20----------
lever on whether i feel ashamed or don't


---------03:22----------
feel ashamed


---------03:23----------
right so then what happens is i wind up


---------03:25----------
doing like all these kinds of appeasing


---------03:26----------
behaviors and then like it just


---------03:27----------
propagates


---------03:28----------
the the negative experience okay


---------03:32----------
so that's the first thing to understand


---------03:34----------
about shane so if you want to overcome


---------03:36----------
shame the first you the first step is to


---------03:39----------
try to figure out you know your mind


---------03:40----------
will be telling you


---------03:42----------
you aren't as smart


---------03:45----------
good competent likable


---------03:48----------
lovable etc you take your pick


---------03:52----------
right and then what it'll do is it'll


---------03:54----------
cite evidence


---------03:55----------
to that effect you'll say because oh


---------03:58----------
look at that person


---------04:00----------
you see he got a better you got better


---------04:01----------
grades than you did


---------04:03----------
this person is more likable this person


---------04:05----------
is more competent this person is better


---------04:07----------
looking


---------04:08----------
so once again as we sort of talked about


---------04:11----------
you know once you have an emotion it


---------04:14----------
hijacks


---------04:15----------
your thinking your rational mind and


---------04:17----------
then what happens is it mis-attributes


---------04:21----------
it misassigns where the problem lies


---------04:24----------
because then like if all of these things


---------04:27----------
are true on the outside


---------04:28----------
then you really do deserve to be ashamed


---------04:31----------
of yourself okay that's the first thing


---------04:32----------
to understand about shane


---------04:33----------
you know like where does this come from


---------04:35----------
so what shame


---------04:36----------
is i know it sounds kind of weird but we


---------04:40----------
think about shame as an emotion right


---------04:42----------
so like we think like you know emotions


---------04:45----------
include shame


---------04:48----------
anger you know fear etc


---------04:52----------
and so i know it sounds kind of weird


---------04:53----------
but then our approach is like okay how


---------04:55----------
do i stop feeling this emotion whereas


---------04:57----------
we actually don't we can't stop feeling


---------04:59----------
an emotion like i know it sounds sort of


---------05:00----------
weird but


---------05:02----------
these are just byproducts


---------05:05----------
they're things that our mind produces


---------05:07----------
due to other things which we're going to


---------05:08----------
get into so it's sort of like you know


---------05:10----------
if i think about how do i deal with fear


---------05:13----------
dealing with fear is not i don't want to


---------05:15----------
deal with the emotion i want to deal


---------05:16----------
with like the associations that create


---------05:19----------
the fear


---------05:20----------
so let's say i get afraid every time i'm


---------05:23----------
in a social situation


---------05:25----------
that fear is the consequence of


---------05:28----------
something else in my mind right there's


---------05:29----------
something else so either


---------05:31----------
some scar but in this case the real


---------05:33----------
thing is a hum


---------05:34----------
god or ego so i want you to understand


---------05:36----------
that the problem here


---------05:38----------
when we talk about core shame okay


---------05:40----------
because even this person describes it as


---------05:42----------
core shame


---------05:42----------
it's not just an emotion because


---------05:44----------
emotions come and go


---------05:46----------
do you guys get that so like this is


---------05:47----------
something neuroscience-wise


---------05:49----------
emotions equilibriate and this is this


---------05:51----------
this is really sad that they really do


---------05:53----------
okay so if we think about we think about


---------05:56----------
bridezillas


---------05:57----------
right so the bridezilla is like i want


---------05:59----------
everything in my wedding to be perfect


---------06:01----------
they want everything they're going to


---------06:03----------
spend so much money everyone's going to


---------06:04----------
be perfect


---------06:05----------
it's gonna be my perfect day


---------06:08----------
so if you create the perfect day and you


---------06:10----------
destroy your relationships and you spend


---------06:12----------
so much money


---------06:13----------
and everything is perfect how long do


---------06:16----------
you stay happy


---------06:18----------
how long does the happiness last if it


---------06:21----------
was a little bit more perfect


---------06:23----------
would the happiness last 40 years if it


---------06:26----------
was a little bit less perfect would it


---------06:27----------
last 30 years


---------06:30----------
so the truth of the matter is that


---------06:31----------
emotions equilibriate it's just how our


---------06:34----------
brain is designed


---------06:35----------
even major depressive disorder and


---------06:37----------
depressive episodes


---------06:38----------
tend to be generally speaking time


---------06:40----------
limited


---------06:42----------
so the evidence suggests that even if


---------06:43----------
you're depressed that that depression


---------06:45----------
will go away over time


---------06:47----------
okay if you're angry it'll go away over


---------06:49----------
time


---------06:50----------
so what where does core shame come from


---------06:53----------
so it's not actually an emotion it is


---------06:56----------
something that


---------06:57----------
continuously creates or triggers emotion


---------07:00----------
that's the difference and where core


---------07:03----------
shame comes from is the ego


---------07:05----------
so the ahamkar is continuously creating


---------07:08----------
new shame and so then you ask the


---------07:10----------
question okay what is the ahamkar what


---------07:11----------
is the ego


---------07:12----------
it's a sense of identity and as long as


---------07:15----------
this sense of identity persists


---------07:18----------
it will continuously


---------07:21----------
increase your shame it's like a shame


---------07:24----------
generating


---------07:24----------
factory right because the shame is just


---------07:27----------
the emotion like you can the emotion


---------07:29----------
will go away on its own


---------07:30----------
if you're someone who's dealing with


---------07:32----------
core shame what you really need to


---------07:33----------
understand


---------07:34----------
is what is the identity structure that


---------07:37----------
creates the shame okay


---------07:40----------
so i hope that that makes sense and so


---------07:42----------
now this person is asking how does core


---------07:44----------
shame become implanted in our mind what


---------07:46----------
i would say becomes implanted as a sense


---------07:48----------
of self


---------07:49----------
that is shameful and now we can even see


---------07:52----------
so the person sort of says i don't know


---------07:53----------
exactly where this comes from but i felt


---------07:55----------
this way my whole life


---------07:57----------
so when this person says things like oh


---------07:58----------
i i've been feeling this way my whole


---------08:00----------
life like i don't understand


---------08:02----------
you know it's not it's been it's like


---------08:03----------
normal for me and yeah that's because


---------08:05----------
it's


---------08:05----------
you carry it around with you constantly


---------08:07----------
it's your sense of identity


---------08:09----------
so then they have another question so if


---------08:11----------
understanding the origins of our shame


---------08:13----------
can help us


---------08:14----------
overcome it and if so how yes absolutely


---------08:17----------
so what i would say is that the way that


---------08:19----------
this is going to work for you if you


---------08:21----------
want this to if you want to stop


---------08:22----------
persistently feeling ashamed of yourself


---------08:24----------
you have to dig into this identity and


---------08:26----------
as long as you


---------08:28----------
are someone who is like deserves to be


---------08:31----------
ashamed of yourself


---------08:32----------
the shame will continue and then what


---------08:34----------
you have to do is remap your identity so


---------08:36----------
i'll give you guys just another example


---------08:38----------
of this okay something i referenced a


---------08:39----------
little bit earlier i want y'all


---------08:41----------
you know i'm going to say something


---------08:42----------
that's sort of self-positive but i think


---------08:44----------
it


---------08:44----------
it illustrates the point so i want you


---------08:47----------
guys to think about the person who got


---------08:49----------
50 rejections from medical school and


---------08:51----------
then 60 rejections from medical school


---------08:53----------
and 70 rejections from medical school


---------08:55----------
ended up getting into medical school i


---------08:57----------
was really happy right i was a dude who


---------08:59----------
persevered


---------09:00----------
i overcame my weaknesses i persevered i


---------09:04----------
was like oh man i was so good


---------09:06----------
then i wound up at harvard and then i'd


---------09:08----------
really overcome my weaknesses


---------09:11----------
i'd overcome my weaknesses that's who i


---------09:13----------
was that was my identity i was first a


---------09:15----------
failure


---------09:16----------
and then i was someone who overcame


---------09:18----------
weaknesses and now


---------09:20----------
i know it sounds kind of weird but what


---------09:21----------
am i what do i want to hang on my wall


---------09:24----------
i don't want to hang the diploma from


---------09:26----------
harvard i want to hang the failures


---------09:28----------
and so now what i've come to realize is


---------09:30----------
that this was never a failure to begin


---------09:32----------
with


---------09:33----------
this is incorrect it's part of who i am


---------09:36----------
i am period that's it i am what i


---------09:39----------
am i am neither a failure nor successful


---------09:42----------
i am neither special nor worthless


---------09:44----------
i'm just me and so what i've observed


---------09:47----------
within myself


---------09:48----------
is like an interesting remapping of


---------09:50----------
identity because i know it sounds kind


---------09:52----------
of weird but like when you get into


---------09:53----------
harvard that's what you want to hang on


---------09:55----------
your res


---------09:55----------
on your wall right when you get it


---------09:58----------
framed you're like man i


---------10:00----------
i need when i was looking at my office


---------10:02----------
my ego was like well i hope there's


---------10:03----------
enough wall space for all my wonderful


---------10:05----------
diplomas


---------10:06----------
because this is ego oh look at me


---------10:10----------
i am triumphant


---------10:13----------
but you can't triumph unless you failed


---------10:16----------
these two come hand in hand so with my


---------10:19----------
identity of failure


---------10:20----------
comes my identity of triumph and now


---------10:24----------
actually what i've done is i've


---------10:25----------
crossed it all out i am that's just


---------10:28----------
it i'm neither special nor worthless


---------10:32----------
and so what you really need to do if you


---------10:33----------
want to stop this sense of shame


---------10:36----------
is to remap your identity so start to


---------10:38----------
ask yourself like


---------10:39----------
who are you okay like really like who


---------10:43----------
are you who have you become who were you


---------10:49----------
and really pay attention to like what


---------10:51----------
comes up there


---------10:53----------
and so then the last kind of question


---------10:54----------
that they've got is are there particular


---------10:56----------
physiological patterns


---------10:58----------
that might serve as helpful tools to


---------11:00----------
overcome shame absolutely we'll talk


---------11:02----------
about that in a second


---------11:03----------
and meditative approaches okay so now


---------11:07----------
if we're talking about overcoming shame


---------11:09----------
there's two elements


---------11:10----------
we got to take a two-pronged approach


---------11:13----------
one is


---------11:14----------
identity and the second is emotion


---------11:16----------
because remember even if we have the


---------11:17----------
identity it's still you're still feeling


---------11:19----------
ashamed in the moment and that makes it


---------11:21----------
hard to do things right


---------11:22----------
so we still gotta deal with that so


---------11:23----------
we're gonna deal with this one first


---------11:25----------
breath


---------11:25----------
there's other stuff you can do but let's


---------11:27----------
start with this so when you experience


---------11:29----------
an emotion


---------11:30----------
your pattern of breathing alters as a


---------11:33----------
result


---------11:34----------
and when you breathe a particular way it


---------11:36----------
alters your emotions


---------11:37----------
this is scientific fact we kind of know


---------11:39----------
this now


---------11:40----------
okay i know it sounds kind of weird but


---------11:42----------
like it's actually what happens


---------11:44----------
so i don't know if you all realize this


---------11:45----------
but in


---------11:47----------
scientific experiments when they are


---------11:49----------
testing anxiety if you're looking at a


---------11:51----------
treatment for anxiety


---------11:53----------
the way that you reproduce anxiety


---------11:56----------
in a laboratory right so if i'm testing


---------11:58----------
let's say a medication for anxiety


---------12:00----------
what i need is a lab full of like


---------12:02----------
anxious people


---------12:04----------
so how do i create all of these people


---------12:07----------
and how do i induce anxiety in the


---------12:09----------
moment


---------12:10----------
what i do is increase the co2


---------12:13----------
concentration


---------12:14----------
that they inhale this literally is the


---------12:16----------
scientific


---------12:17----------
standard for creating anxiety in another


---------12:20----------
human being for research purposes


---------12:23----------
so you give them a gas mask that has a


---------12:25----------
higher level of co2 concentration


---------12:27----------
it's it's wild that's like literally


---------12:29----------
what you do i hope it's


---------12:31----------
increase maybe it's decreased i know


---------12:33----------
it's 7.5 percent can someone check


---------12:35----------
whether atmospheric if that's lower that


---------12:37----------
or higher than atmospheric concentration


---------12:39----------
i'm pretty sure it's 7.5


---------12:40----------
co2 and so it's interesting because you


---------12:42----------
can literally induce an emotion by


---------12:44----------
altering


---------12:45----------
the co2 and oxygen concentration of what


---------12:47----------
you breathe


---------12:49----------
so breathe so i guess that shame has a


---------12:52----------
relatively


---------12:54----------
deep and rapid breathing pattern okay


---------12:58----------
i'm not so sure that it's actually


---------12:59----------
shallow but if you alter your breath


---------13:02----------
your mind will change with it


---------13:04----------
so what i would recommend is nari shuddi


---------13:07----------
that's our go-to and it's a go-to for a


---------13:10----------
reason


---------13:10----------
if you want to do something a little bit


---------13:12----------
stronger you can do ohm chanting


---------13:16----------
and just chant the shame out right


---------13:23----------
just let it out and you can be like oh


---------13:26----------
my god that's so embarrassing


---------13:28----------
i'd feel like an idiot yes exactly and


---------13:30----------
just chant through it


---------13:33----------
we'll practice that today okay so that's


---------13:35----------
what i would do so in the moment this is


---------13:37----------
how you physiologically handle shame


---------13:39----------
next thing identity what do we do about


---------13:42----------
that so this is where there's a lot of


---------13:43----------
stuff


---------13:44----------
um you know we can talk about i think uh


---------13:46----------
once again the atman


---------13:48----------
like there's a reason why the dr k's


---------13:50----------
guide is what it is chad it's because


---------13:51----------
like most of the stuff is in there


---------13:54----------
so if we think about you know who are


---------13:56----------
you and why do you deserve to be ashamed


---------13:58----------
of yourself


---------14:00----------
like why are you deserving of shame so


---------14:03----------
there's dealing with the actual emotion


---------14:05----------
but i would ask yourself the question


---------14:06----------
why do you deserve


---------14:12----------
to be ashamed and then i would ask


---------14:13----------
yourself you know how long


---------14:16----------
have you deserved


---------14:19----------
to be ashamed and i'd really pay


---------14:21----------
attention there


---------14:22----------
and then the third question is what


---------14:25----------
happened


---------14:26----------
right to take a look at like you know


---------14:28----------
remember when you were five years old


---------14:30----------
were you ashamed of yourself and then


---------14:32----------
when you were eight years old were you


---------14:34----------
ashamed of yourself and you'll say yes


---------14:36----------
okay so what happened between five and


---------14:38----------
eight you may not be able to uncover


---------14:39----------
anything


---------14:41----------
but then i know it sounds kind of weird


---------14:43----------
this is tough it requires some


---------14:44----------
introspection and if you do these


---------14:46----------
these practices regularly over time


---------14:49----------
this part will become easier then what i


---------14:52----------
would do when you


---------14:54----------
experience the shame and this is kind of


---------14:56----------
when to how to tie it together so


---------14:58----------
in a moment of shame i would ask


---------15:00----------
yourself one last question


---------15:02----------
which is are you someone that deserves


---------15:05----------
to be ashamed right now


---------15:07----------
or are you ashamed right now i know it


---------15:10----------
sounds kind of weird but like think


---------15:12----------
about the identity versus the


---------15:14----------
circumstance


---------15:15----------
and what you'll discover is that there


---------15:18----------
is a part of your mind


---------15:20----------
that basically assumes that you should


---------15:22----------
be ashamed


---------15:23----------
okay so now someone is saying


---------15:27----------
five-year-olds don't deserve shame


---------15:30----------
okay but i want you all to understand


---------15:32----------
this when you don't deserve


---------15:34----------
something and it happens to you anyway


---------15:38----------
that is what rewires your perception of


---------15:42----------
what is deserved


---------15:44----------
do you guys get that like that is it in


---------15:47----------
a nutshell


---------15:48----------
that's where the core comes from when i


---------15:50----------
don't deserve


---------15:52----------
something and it happens anyway it


---------15:55----------
reprograms my understanding


---------15:58----------
of what is deserved and what is not


---------16:00----------
deserved


---------16:02----------
and then i carry that programming


---------16:05----------
through life


---------16:08----------
which is where you carry the identity of


---------16:10----------
shame


---------16:11----------
so that's where you have to go back


---------16:15----------
and remap it figure out oh this


---------16:18----------
fundamental principle which i have grown


---------16:22----------
up with


---------16:23----------
like gravity like do you guys get that


---------16:25----------
when you're five years old


---------16:27----------
you're understanding you're laying down


---------16:30----------
the cement


---------16:30----------
to understand gravity in


---------16:34----------
social interactions an identity a one


---------16:37----------
month old doesn't know who they are they


---------16:38----------
don't have the capacity to know who they


---------16:40----------
are


---------16:41----------
the five-year-old just sort of knows on


---------16:43----------
a broad sense whether i'm good or i'm


---------16:45----------
bad


---------16:48----------
have i been a bad boy or have i been a


---------16:49----------
good boy and when some things happened


---------16:51----------
to me that like


---------16:52----------
i'm just playing with my blocks when dad


---------16:55----------
comes over


---------16:56----------
hits me upside the head because i'm


---------16:58----------
playing with my blocks


---------17:00----------
oh boy is playing with my blocks bad no


---------17:03----------
because i play with my blocks at school


---------17:05----------
so how do i explain that oh it must be


---------17:08----------
me


---------17:09----------
kids play with blocks all the time i saw


---------17:11----------
these look at all these commercials


---------17:13----------
where people are playing with blocks why


---------17:15----------
am i getting it it must be


---------17:17----------
me and it changes the idea of what you


---------17:20----------
deserve


---------17:21----------
and then you carry the idea forward that


---------17:23----------
you deserve to be ashamed so you have to


---------17:26----------
go back


---------17:26----------
and re-examine that right and recognize


---------17:30----------
and this is really emotionally painful


---------17:32----------
by the way


---------17:33----------
liberating painful and we've done this


---------17:35----------
on stream a lot right like


---------17:37----------
i'd say the who's the there's the guy


---------17:39----------
who's in the cult


---------17:41----------
where like i i encourage y'all to watch


---------17:43----------
that and there was the other guy who


---------17:45----------
hadn't cried in a long time he's tired


---------17:46----------
of crying


---------17:47----------
he doesn't need to cry anymore watch


---------17:48----------
that one too


---------17:50----------
but i think it's like these people were


---------17:52----------
taught that this is what they deserve


---------17:55----------
this is your lot in life


---------17:58----------
and so you have to go back and hopefully


---------18:03----------
you know you can do it to a certain


---------18:04----------
degree on your own you can absolutely do


---------18:06----------
it in therapy like some of our coaches


---------18:07----------
can probably handle this kind of stuff


---------18:10----------
actually a lot of them can it's


---------18:11----------
something we deal with a lot


---------18:13----------
and then the other thing is it doesn't


---------18:14----------
have to be through that right like you


---------18:16----------
can just grow as a human being and begin


---------18:18----------
to realize like i did that like i was


---------18:19----------
never a failure and i was never a


---------18:21----------
success


---------18:22----------
the whole paradigm is incorrect there's


---------18:24----------
no such thing as either one


---------18:26----------
right like it's just i am what i am


---------18:30----------
and i have just as much reason to be


---------18:32----------
proud of


---------18:33----------
of all of my rejection letters as i do


---------18:35----------
of my diploma


---------18:36----------
right like the rest of it the shame and


---------18:39----------
the failure and crap like that that's


---------18:40----------
all crap that my mind


---------18:42----------
creates it's not real and once you kind


---------18:45----------
of realize that then it changes who you


---------18:47----------
are that's how you remap your identity


---------19:00----------
you
