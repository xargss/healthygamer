---------00:00----------
and there's really interesting research


---------00:02----------
if you look at research on incels


---------00:03----------
is that there's an online radicalization


---------00:06----------
process


---------00:07----------
and this is not actually it's not really


---------00:08----------
anyone's fault it's just interesting


---------00:10----------
because if you think about youtube right


---------00:11----------
if i watch a video on


---------00:13----------
youtube on incels what is youtube going


---------00:16----------
to suggest to me


---------00:17----------
so hi dr k do you have any advice on


---------00:20----------
female in cells i'm in my late 20s and


---------00:24----------
have never had a boyfriend this has


---------00:25----------
caused me to develop severe self-esteem


---------00:27----------
issues


---------00:28----------
i've heard you say that women are the


---------00:30----------
ones who pick the partners what


---------00:33----------
and that women have to deal with too


---------00:35----------
much attention and harassment


---------00:37----------
i have the opposite problem of most


---------00:38----------
women this makes me feel almost


---------00:40----------
sub-human


---------00:42----------
i also feel like i'm running out of time


---------00:43----------
to experience a romantic relationship


---------00:46----------
if no one wanted to be with me in the


---------00:49----------
teens and 20s


---------00:50----------
what chance do i have in my 30s and 40s


---------00:53----------
so this is a great question


---------00:54----------
so one of the really interesting things


---------00:56----------
so we're actually writing a paper at


---------00:58----------
healthygamer on insults


---------01:00----------
and we've been doing a lot of research


---------01:02----------
on this topic because i think it's


---------01:03----------
something that a lot of people


---------01:05----------
suffer from and struggle with and i


---------01:06----------
think a lot of our


---------01:08----------
you know we try to support the incel


---------01:11----------
community for lack of a better term i


---------01:13----------
mean i know that sounds kind of scary


---------01:14----------
but


---------01:15----------
what i mean by that is like we try to


---------01:17----------
help people understand that they have


---------01:19----------
intrinsic value and that a lot of the


---------01:21----------
sort of in-cell kind of


---------01:23----------
thinking and belief system may not be


---------01:25----------
entirely correct


---------01:26----------
so there are a couple of things that i


---------01:28----------
want to point out the first is that


---------01:29----------
generally speaking incel


---------01:30----------
appears to be like refers to men right


---------01:33----------
so if you look at the published


---------01:35----------
literature


---------01:35----------
on in cells they tend to focus entirely


---------01:39----------
on men


---------01:40----------
but it's been our experience that


---------01:41----------
they're actually like female people who


---------01:43----------
identify with the term incel so i think


---------01:45----------
that's a huge problem


---------01:46----------
in like the published literature in the


---------01:48----------
way that people look at things


---------01:50----------
so i think that you know this sort of


---------01:52----------
belief or idea that you're an


---------01:54----------
incel and will never find a romantic


---------01:55----------
relationship is not gender specific


---------01:57----------
it may certainly be more prevalent in


---------01:59----------
men i'm not quite sure i you know i'd


---------02:01----------
really have to see statistics around


---------02:02----------
that but i


---------02:03----------
generally speaking makes sense to me


---------02:05----------
because i tend to see


---------02:06----------
or hear more about male in cells i i


---------02:09----------
don't know if i i mean if i said that


---------02:11----------
women pick their partners i i know that


---------02:12----------
that's a lot of like the thinking of


---------02:14----------
incels is that women there's a sexual


---------02:16----------
marketplace and whatnot


---------02:18----------
i mean i generally speaking so if i said


---------02:19----------
that in the past i you know it's i


---------02:21----------
didn't mean it like that


---------02:23----------
um and it's my experience that generally


---------02:24----------
speaking when you're picking a partner


---------02:26----------
like


---------02:26----------
both people pick right so the whole idea


---------02:29----------
behind a partnership is that it's like a


---------02:31----------
mutual arrangement


---------02:32----------
and it's not like one person is picking


---------02:34----------
and the other person isn't


---------02:35----------
i understand that that's been some


---------02:36----------
people's experiences and some people can


---------02:38----------
definitely get into the sort of


---------02:39----------
relationship where


---------02:41----------
there's a power dynamic so don't get me


---------02:43----------
wrong there that's definitely possible


---------02:44----------
but i think that generally speaking


---------02:46----------
if you think about a relationship it's


---------02:48----------
like the whole point is that there's a


---------02:50----------
relation right so there's like


---------02:51----------
both people are sort of agreeing to have


---------02:53----------
this relationship


---------02:54----------
and so i think the problem here is that


---------02:57----------
if we listen to what this person says


---------02:58----------
they're saying women are the ones who


---------03:00----------
get to pick and i i


---------03:02----------
have the opposite problem so i'm not


---------03:04----------
like most women therefore i feel


---------03:06----------
subhuman


---------03:07----------
so if you stop and think about it for a


---------03:08----------
second what you see is that the feeling


---------03:10----------
of sub-human


---------03:11----------
is rooted in the idea


---------03:14----------
that most people are one way


---------03:18----------
and i am the other way so it it's


---------03:21----------
interesting because like


---------03:22----------
where where do you get the idea that


---------03:24----------
most women women are one way and that


---------03:26----------
you're a different way


---------03:27----------
so i think there's also something that's


---------03:29----------
that's very common for people which is


---------03:30----------
that they feel like they're running out


---------03:31----------
of time to experience a romantic


---------03:33----------
relationship


---------03:34----------
and that makes sense like the time you


---------03:36----------
know the hourglasses is kind of going


---------03:38----------
and the further that you


---------03:39----------
go the the worse off you are so i want


---------03:42----------
to share with you guys a couple of the


---------03:43----------
things that we've discovered through our


---------03:45----------
research i mean it's not


---------03:46----------
like this stuff is sort of known already


---------03:48----------
but like this is what we piece together


---------03:49----------
is maybe a better way to put it


---------03:50----------
so the first is that when people are in


---------03:53----------
cells that


---------03:54----------
it's primarily like sort of a


---------03:55----------
psychological thing so it's not actually


---------03:57----------
like


---------03:58----------
it's a belief system so here's what


---------04:00----------
happens with an insult


---------04:01----------
so they start out with usually some kind


---------04:03----------
of adverse


---------04:04----------
experience or the idea of a missed


---------04:07----------
milestone


---------04:08----------
so they it's not even like necessarily


---------04:10----------
something bad happened to them but they


---------04:11----------
turn 18 or they turn 21 or they graduate


---------04:14----------
from college and it starts with this


---------04:16----------
sort of idea that like


---------04:17----------
i was supposed to have done something by


---------04:19----------
a particular time


---------04:21----------
there's a missed milestone that's where


---------04:23----------
it starts


---------04:24----------
or some kind of rejection or negative


---------04:26----------
experience and then what's really


---------04:28----------
changed now is that we can sort of


---------04:31----------
engage with communities that will


---------04:33----------
actually like reinforce this idea


---------04:36----------
so if you engage with a community where


---------04:37----------
everyone else has missed milestones and


---------04:39----------
none of the people have sort of


---------04:41----------
made it out of inseldom it's going to


---------04:44----------
color


---------04:44----------
your perspective on the world and so


---------04:46----------
then what becomes a personal experience


---------04:48----------
that maze


---------04:49----------
maybe is actually changeable starts to


---------04:51----------
feel like universal truth


---------04:53----------
and there's really interesting research


---------04:55----------
if you look at research on incels


---------04:57----------
is that there's a online radicalization


---------04:59----------
process


---------05:00----------
and this is not actually it's not really


---------05:02----------
anyone's fault it's just interesting


---------05:03----------
because if you think about


---------05:04----------
youtube right if i watch a video on


---------05:06----------
youtube on incels


---------05:09----------
what is youtube going to suggest to me


---------05:11----------
so you have these content platforms that


---------05:13----------
are trying to do their best


---------05:15----------
to make their content the most appealing


---------05:17----------
to you


---------05:18----------
and if you watch one incel video then


---------05:20----------
you're going to get populated with like


---------05:21----------
a second one and if you watch the second


---------05:23----------
one then you're gonna get populated with


---------05:24----------
four


---------05:25----------
and six and ten so there's this online


---------05:27----------
radicalization effect which is probably


---------05:28----------
has something to do with the algorithms


---------05:30----------
of content platforms


---------05:31----------
so it's not like people are purposely


---------05:33----------
seeking this stuff out maybe some of


---------05:34----------
them are


---------05:36----------
but if you look there's this online


---------05:38----------
drift so you start out with sort of like


---------05:40----------
the gateway drug and then you kind of


---------05:43----------
gradually like what happens is these


---------05:45----------
platforms will push you


---------05:47----------
towards more radicalizing content so


---------05:50----------
this is why you see


---------05:51----------
radicalization in general amongst


---------05:52----------
politics and all kinds of other things


---------05:54----------
so it has a really interesting effect on


---------05:56----------
your psychology


---------05:58----------
and so psychologically what starts to


---------06:01----------
happen is your experience becomes


---------06:02----------
incredibly validated


---------06:04----------
and now we get to something else about


---------06:06----------
thin cell communities that it's


---------06:07----------
incredibly validating right like this


---------06:08----------
person feels like


---------06:10----------
they're sub-human and so it can feel


---------06:12----------
actually really good to be like in a


---------06:14----------
community with other people who feel


---------06:15----------
subhuman because they're people who get


---------06:17----------
you


---------06:17----------
right they're your people and so like


---------06:20----------
this is this is a world that rejects you


---------06:23----------
and so you can find a community that


---------06:25----------
accepts you the way you are and says


---------06:27----------
yeah it sucks


---------06:28----------
it's not your fault there's a sexual


---------06:30----------
marketplace value


---------06:31----------
your jaw line isn't manly enough you


---------06:34----------
were born with the beta gene


---------06:36----------
it's not your fault don't feel that way


---------06:38----------
about yourself it's sad it's true


---------06:40----------
it's incredibly validating and


---------06:43----------
and so there's this weird kind of


---------06:45----------
combination of online radicalization


---------06:47----------
along with like warm open arms which


---------06:49----------
then gets people to really think this


---------06:51----------
way right and then you start thinking


---------06:52----------
that way


---------06:53----------
it's very emotionally like gratifying


---------06:55----------
then you can start to


---------06:57----------
believe these things and it's not it's


---------06:59----------
not wrong to believe them because that's


---------07:01----------
what your brain is designed to do


---------07:03----------
if you're hanging out with a thousand


---------07:04----------
people that all tell you the same thing


---------07:05----------
like you're gonna start believing it


---------07:07----------
it's like


---------07:07----------
how it works the short answer is that


---------07:09----------
you've still got a chance like


---------07:10----------
absolutely right so the only time you


---------07:12----------
don't have a chance is when you stop


---------07:14----------
trying


---------07:15----------
that's really the only thing that will


---------07:16----------
determine when you don't have a chance


---------07:18----------
i've worked with tons of incels


---------07:19----------
and my experience has been that what's


---------07:22----------
really at the core of it


---------07:23----------
is the self-esteem it's not that like


---------07:26----------
and it becomes a self-fulfilling


---------07:27----------
prophecy because


---------07:28----------
once certain experiences cause you to


---------07:30----------
have a self-esteem


---------07:32----------
that feeling of being sub-human is going


---------07:34----------
to affect


---------07:35----------
every romantic interaction that you have


---------07:38----------
and so it's it's overcoming that


---------07:40----------
internal feeling of self-esteem or


---------07:42----------
feeling subhuman


---------07:43----------
which will then naturally create alter


---------07:46----------
the way that you engage in relationships


---------07:48----------
so oddly enough i think people think


---------07:50----------
about being an incel and the cure to


---------07:52----------
being an incel


---------07:53----------
is getting laid or finding a partner


---------07:57----------
and so then you're no longer an insult


---------07:59----------
but we've even had people on stream who


---------08:01----------
have like had relationships and they're


---------08:03----------
like i'm still an insult


---------08:05----------
so it's bizarre because people think


---------08:07----------
that becoming no longer being an incel


---------08:09----------
is about an outward change but it's not


---------08:11----------
about an outward change it's about an


---------08:12----------
internal change


---------08:15----------
and we've seen that we've seen people


---------08:16----------
who like actually have relationships


---------08:18----------
have women that persistently ask them


---------08:20----------
out and they still feel like an insult


---------08:22----------
and so it's not it has nothing to do


---------08:24----------
with the outside you being an in-cell


---------08:26----------
has nothing to do with like


---------08:27----------
with the way that people treat you it


---------08:29----------
has everything to do with the way that


---------08:30----------
you perceive yourself


---------08:32----------
right because who like is there like a


---------08:34----------
you know crowd of people that's like


---------08:36----------
running around and like calling you an


---------08:37----------
insult no


---------08:38----------
it's an identity that you take on


---------08:41----------
and so the cool thing is that if it's an


---------08:43----------
identity that you take on


---------08:45----------
it's also within your power to no longer


---------08:49----------
have it now it's not easy i'm making it


---------08:52----------
sound easy it's certainly not easy it


---------08:54----------
takes a lot of work


---------08:54----------
right so it requires a lot of like


---------08:57----------
effort and self-reflection


---------08:59----------
and really like digging to the bottom of


---------09:00----------
your self-esteem so i'd say that the


---------09:02----------
real approach is to like


---------09:04----------
tackle the some scar of low self-esteem


---------09:07----------
and this is where i'd even


---------09:08----------
say like you know when did you start


---------09:09----------
feeling like you were an incel because i


---------09:11----------
don't think


---------09:12----------
it's like has nothing to do with your


---------09:13----------
20s it's probably happened a long time


---------09:15----------
ago


---------09:16----------
may even have nothing to do when did you


---------09:17----------
start feeling subhuman it may not have


---------09:19----------
even been in your teen years like you


---------09:21----------
may have had some kind of experience in


---------09:22----------
childhood where you really really felt


---------09:25----------
like sub-human and so that feeling of


---------09:28----------
sub-humanness which you carry with you


---------09:30----------
then finds a new set of clothes which is


---------09:32----------
in seldom


---------09:34----------
and so it like puts that on so i think


---------09:36----------
there's absolutely hope for you you just


---------09:38----------
have to be willing to try


---------09:40----------
and i know that you try really really


---------09:41----------
hard it's just you have to try in sort


---------09:43----------
of a different way


---------09:44----------
so i'd say forget about the incel forget


---------09:46----------
about the relationships


---------09:47----------
and focus a little bit about what's


---------09:49----------
really chipped away at your self-esteem


---------09:51----------
what's chip


---------09:52----------
what's contributed this idea that you're


---------09:53----------
sub-human and work on like building


---------09:56----------
confidence and spending time with nature


---------09:57----------
and like things like that


---------09:59----------
okay hope that's helpful and good luck


---------10:01----------
to you
