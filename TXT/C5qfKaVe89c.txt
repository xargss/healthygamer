---------00:00----------
my name is Alok energy I'm a


---------00:02----------
psychiatrist practicing in Boston


---------00:04----------
Massachusetts welcome to another healthy


---------00:07----------
gamer GG stream just a reminder that


---------00:11----------
everything that we do on stream is


---------00:15----------
intended to educate and support y'all


---------00:17----------
but nothing is intended to be medical


---------00:19----------
advice and I will say this now more than


---------00:22----------
ever that this is not a substitute for


---------00:26----------
mental health treatment and so if you


---------00:33----------
guys are struggling you really we're


---------00:35----------
gonna basically spend the whole second


---------00:37----------
talking about this but we're gonna spend


---------00:40----------
you guys should really get help go see a


---------00:43----------
licensed professional I'm not kidding


---------00:46----------
about that a lot of people will reach


---------00:49----------
out to me and say dr. kay I'll pay you


---------00:50----------
whatever you want I just want one


---------00:52----------
session and I want to make this clear


---------00:56----------
that one session with me is not going to


---------00:59----------
fix your problems I know that's what


---------01:00----------
people think six sessions with me is not


---------01:04----------
going to fix your problems and yeah I


---------01:10----------
mean what what fixes problems is actual


---------01:13----------
mental health treatment and we try


---------01:16----------
really hard to support people into


---------01:17----------
getting that when necessary in in our


---------01:24----------
hope here our mission here is to help


---------01:26----------
people understand that mental health is


---------01:29----------
real that it's devastating that you can


---------01:33----------
understand your mind and that there are


---------01:36----------
ways to help yourself in addition to


---------01:40----------
mental health treatment understanding


---------01:41----------
yourself that's what our mission is and


---------01:43----------
I'm going to talk about that too so a


---------01:46----------
couple of just simple disclaimers the


---------01:47----------
first is that I mean I'm gonna talk


---------01:51----------
about Byron and reckful but like it's he


---------01:57----------
still has a right to privacy and


---------02:02----------
confidentiality


---------02:03----------
so I'm not gonna like answer any


---------02:05----------
questions about him or anything like


---------02:07----------
that so I mean y'all can ask that I'm


---------02:10----------
just not going to say anything I think


---------02:13----------
you know there's a lot more to his story


---------02:14----------
than most people know and his people who


---------02:16----------
are close to him kind of know that yeah


---------02:24----------
so let's get started


---------02:28----------
it's the first thing that I want to talk


---------02:29----------
about is depression so this is gonna


---------02:33----------
sound kinda weird I've always thought I


---------02:37----------
had a weird realization when I was


---------02:38----------
training to become a psychiatrist and


---------02:40----------
that is that depression is the HIV of


---------02:42----------
the mind and what do I mean by that I


---------02:46----------
know it sounds weird but just hear me


---------02:49----------
out


---------02:49----------
so like you know when you get an


---------02:52----------
infection like let's say you get a skin


---------02:54----------
infection like you know the infection


---------02:58----------
attacks your skin well let's say you get


---------03:00----------
a GI bug like a stomach bug or you get


---------03:03----------
the flu and it attacks like your upper


---------03:07----------
respiratory system it attacks your


---------03:09----------
stomach tax your skin and then your


---------03:14----------
immune system is like how you fight back


---------03:15----------
right so your immune system activates


---------03:18----------
and it goes and it fights a war with the


---------03:20----------
infection in your skin and your stomach


---------03:22----------
and after a couple days you're better


---------03:24----------
the reason why HIV is such a devastating


---------03:26----------
disease is because it attacks your


---------03:29----------
actual immune system it attacks your


---------03:31----------
ability to fight back and this is


---------03:35----------
another bad gaming analogy but like I


---------03:37----------
think of most infections as jungle


---------03:38----------
creeps in dota or MO and like they don't


---------03:42----------
actually attack you back they just sure


---------03:46----------
if you go and pick a fight with them


---------03:47----------
they're gonna fight you but like they're


---------03:49----------
not like attacking your throne right


---------03:52----------
they're not attacking they're not


---------03:54----------
attacking you back like your soldiers


---------03:55----------
are free to fight them but HIV is


---------03:58----------
different


---------03:59----------
HIV is like the enemy team it attacks


---------04:02----------
you back it attacks you in the way that


---------04:04----------
like you fight it's not neutral it's not


---------04:09----------
just sitting there attacking some random


---------04:11----------
part of your body and then like your


---------04:13----------
immune cells like your white blood cells


---------04:15----------
are just there to like go to town in it


---------04:16----------
and that's why that's why infections


---------04:19----------
generally speaking don't kill us


---------04:20----------
right we get flus and colds and stomach


---------04:23----------
bugs like we get that stuff all like you


---------04:25----------
know all the time most of it doesn't


---------04:26----------
kill us


---------04:27----------
HIV Kelsey HIV kills tons of people it's


---------04:31----------
devastating it's a it used to be a death


---------04:34----------
sentence and why is that because it


---------04:36----------
attacks your ability to fight back and


---------04:39----------
that's what


---------04:41----------
depression it's depression attacks your


---------04:45----------
ability to fight back it makes you think


---------04:49----------
that you can't win it makes you think


---------04:51----------
that the people that love you would be


---------04:53----------
better off without you it controls your


---------04:56----------
actions it attacks your very ability to


---------04:59----------
fight back and so that's what makes it


---------05:10----------
so devastating we rely so much on our


---------05:14----------
mind to help us out to protect us to


---------05:17----------
help us move forward in life and


---------05:18----------
depression attacks that I mean like


---------05:21----------
anxieties bad sure I mean there all


---------05:23----------
kinds of you know mental this is that


---------05:24----------
are bad but I think depression is is in


---------05:26----------
some ways the most devastating because


---------05:30----------
it takes your biggest weapon and it


---------05:32----------
turns it against you right your thought


---------05:35----------
your mind which wink which can be


---------05:37----------
compassionate and helpful and brilliant


---------05:40----------
and analytical suddenly becomes this


---------05:44----------
thing that is attacking you and that's


---------05:47----------
what's so devastating and I don't know


---------05:51----------
if you guys saw you know Byron's last


---------05:53----------
tweets but like I mean he knew it too


---------05:55----------
right he said that like you're not in


---------05:57----------
control and that's what it does


---------06:04----------
so over 50% of adults over 50% okay just


---------06:10----------
think about this in middle and


---------06:13----------
high-income countries and developed


---------06:15----------
countries are gonna suffer from some


---------06:16----------
mental health problem in their life


---------06:18----------
we're not talking about cancer cancer


---------06:22----------
like at the end of the day is


---------06:23----------
devastating but effects like a small


---------06:24----------
percentage of people right what five


---------06:27----------
percent maybe mental health is can


---------06:31----------
affect more than 50% of people so it's I


---------06:37----------
mean people talk about kovat is a


---------06:39----------
pandemic and absolutely it is and Kove


---------06:41----------
it's terrible but like mental health is


---------06:43----------
an epidemic that has been silent and


---------06:45----------
been ravaging the developed world


---------06:48----------
probably the thurible countries as well


---------06:51----------
but definitely busts for years and it's


---------06:56----------
getting worse


---------06:57----------
and I don't think we're doing enough


---------06:59----------
about it so let's talk for a second


---------07:04----------
about suicide so when we say mental


---------07:07----------
health is getting worse


---------07:08----------
so suicide overall over the last decade


---------07:10----------
is increased by a third you know we're


---------07:13----------
getting better at treating other


---------07:15----------
diseases like cancer rates are down


---------07:17----------
heart disease rates generally speaking


---------07:19----------
or down I mean those are the diseases


---------07:22----------
that tend to happen when we get older so


---------07:24----------
you know things like Alzheimer's are on


---------07:26----------
the rise but that's probably just


---------07:27----------
because we're living longer but mental


---------07:30----------
health is actually increasing in in


---------07:32----------
what's really scary is that like a 33


---------07:34----------
percent increase in the population


---------07:37----------
doesn't mean that everyone is increasing


---------07:40----------
33 percent what's really happening in


---------07:42----------
mental health is that suicide rates are


---------07:45----------
doubling have doubled I think in the


---------07:47----------
last decade in teenagers so in 2003 the


---------07:53----------
suicide rate amongst teenagers increased


---------07:55----------
by 8% I have no idea what happened in


---------07:57----------
2003 they go up they're going up by


---------08:00----------
about 5% per year video game addiction


---------08:02----------
is doubled in the last five years the


---------08:07----------
33%


---------08:08----------
driven by the whole population it's


---------08:10----------
driven by us we're the ones that are


---------08:14----------
killing ourselves more and more so I


---------08:21----------
don't know if you guys get this but


---------08:23----------
suicide is literally killing us I know


---------08:27----------
it's a weird thing to say but the second


---------08:31----------
most dangerous thing to you is you you


---------08:37----------
are actually gonna be them the second


---------08:39----------
most likely cause of your death and by


---------08:41----------
you I mean between the ages of ten and


---------08:44----------
thirty four the number one cause of


---------08:46----------
death is accidents car accidents getting


---------08:48----------
hit by meteors like whatever just like


---------08:50----------
sure so the most dangerous thing to you


---------08:54----------
is like completely random there's


---------08:56----------
nothing you can do about it second most


---------08:58----------
dangerous thing to you is you it's not


---------09:02----------
cancer it's not heart disease it's not


---------09:05----------
like I mean I guess you've got an


---------09:07----------
accidents connecting but you are you are


---------09:09----------
you are the most dangerous controllable


---------09:13----------
thing the in your life the only factor


---------09:17----------
that you can control because you can't


---------09:19----------
control accidents like I can't control


---------09:21----------
if I'm like you know I'm on a plane and


---------09:22----------
it goes down the most lethal thing to


---------09:25----------
you is actually in your control and


---------09:28----------
that's you so the first thing that I


---------09:34----------
want to say is don't worry alone and


---------09:37----------
don't die alone suicide and depression


---------09:41----------
get bad because they turn what should be


---------09:44----------
a multiplayer game into his player name


---------09:48----------
right and I mean that's what happens we


---------09:54----------
start to isolate because then if it's a


---------09:56----------
multiplayer game like that's that's what


---------09:58----------
we do right that's what twitch is about


---------09:59----------
its multiplayer you have friends you


---------10:03----------
have allies to have us we have you and


---------10:08----------
what depression does is turns it into a


---------10:12----------
single-player game and this game was not


---------10:13----------
designed to be played along I don't know


---------10:15----------
if you guys get that but you look around


---------10:17----------
it's society and society is made of


---------10:20----------
people


---------10:22----------
the first thing that I'd say to you is


---------10:23----------
don't worry alone and don't dial them if


---------10:25----------
you're worried about someone top someone


---------10:28----------
something just talk to someone it


---------10:30----------
doesn't matter who talk to someone


---------10:34----------
anyone talk to your friends talk to your


---------10:36----------
family talk to your buddies on Steam


---------10:40----------
talk to your buddies on you know reddit


---------10:43----------
twitter instagram twitch talk to


---------10:48----------
something and tell people what you want


---------10:52----------
to do cuz give them a chance because


---------10:55----------
that's what we need right like we just


---------10:57----------
need a chance to help you and you need


---------10:59----------
to give us a chance to help you because


---------11:03----------
that's what we want to do right you


---------11:04----------
think about the people like if you have


---------11:07----------
friends that want to kill themselves


---------11:08----------
what do you want from them you just want


---------11:12----------
a chance to be a part of their


---------11:16----------
conversation in their life you can't


---------11:19----------
save them that's okay but you just want


---------11:23----------
to be involved and so it's a it's a big


---------11:26----------
motto that we have sort of on the


---------11:27----------
coaching side which is don't worry alone


---------11:29----------
if you've got a problem like just don't


---------11:31----------
don't play a solo player game like if


---------11:33----------
you're playing Dark Souls you know call


---------11:35----------
in a son bro to help you out because


---------11:41----------
right now what's what's happening in


---------11:43----------
this country


---------11:44----------
is it is an epidemic of disconnection


---------11:48----------
every year that goes by I want you guys


---------11:51----------
to just think about this for a second we


---------11:55----------
are a greater threat to ourselves for


---------11:58----------
the most part we've like sort of


---------12:00----------
conquered infections right even HIV like


---------12:05----------
HIV is no longer a death sentence in


---------12:07----------
fact the life expectancy with HIV is


---------12:09----------
getting close to normal like if your


---------12:13----------
heart is clogged and can't breathe we


---------12:16----------
can actually hook your heart up to a


---------12:19----------
machine that that circulates your blood


---------12:22----------
while we take a vein from your leg and


---------12:26----------
attach it to your heart


---------12:28----------
and then you have a bypass in your heart


---------12:33----------
works again like what


---------12:35----------
the actual [ __ ] we are capable of doing


---------12:38----------
that if you have a knee that is torn


---------12:41----------
apart from arthritis we can literally


---------12:43----------
remove the knee and put in a piece of


---------12:45----------
metal and you can walk again


---------12:48----------
right now there are tons of people who


---------12:50----------
are dying from kovat and it's terrible


---------12:52----------
but what's crazy is that some of them


---------12:55----------
are living and the reason that they're


---------12:56----------
living is because we have a thing called


---------12:58----------
a ventilator and what a ventilator is


---------13:01----------
like we can literally breathe for you we


---------13:04----------
can pump your heart for you we can


---------13:08----------
breathe for you we can replace your


---------13:10----------
joints we can do dialysis which is for


---------13:15----------
your kidneys right so like we can every


---------13:19----------
three days you can go to a dialysis


---------13:21----------
center it filters all of your blood and


---------13:24----------
does the work of your kidneys so you


---------13:25----------
don't even need a kidney oh and by the


---------13:27----------
way we can do transplants we can take an


---------13:29----------
organ from one human being and stick it


---------13:31----------
into another team of people what the


---------13:32----------
[ __ ] that's crazy


---------13:35----------
medicine is amazing we also have TPM


---------13:38----------
total parenteral nutrition if you can't


---------13:41----------
eat we can stick an IV in your arm and


---------13:45----------
give you food and sustenance we can keep


---------13:48----------
you alive without eating we can keep


---------13:50----------
your you alive without your heart


---------13:51----------
beating we can keep you alive without


---------13:53----------
your breathing we can keep you alive


---------13:54----------
without your kidneys working we can keep


---------13:56----------
you alive without you eating we can


---------13:59----------
replace your joints and we can craft


---------14:01----------
organs into you from another human being


---------14:04----------
what's missing what can't we do we can't


---------14:07----------
do anything for your brain and we can't


---------14:09----------
do anything for your mind this is the


---------14:13----------
problem that we face in as society


---------14:17----------
changes I don't know exactly what's


---------14:18----------
going on but we have an epidemic of


---------14:20----------
disconnection we can't fix this for you


---------14:23----------
medicine can't fix it for you this is


---------14:26----------
the one thing we can't fix for you we


---------14:30----------
can literally like replace every other


---------14:33----------
organ of your body we can if you're if


---------14:36----------
you don't have lengths we can give you a


---------14:37----------
wheelchair if you can't speak we can


---------14:40----------
give you a voice box can't do anything


---------14:44----------
for the mind and not anything that's we


---------14:48----------
can't


---------14:48----------
I set for you all right let me say that


---------14:52----------
and so this is getting worse and we


---------14:55----------
haven't figured out how to fix it yet


---------14:58----------
and so we've got to do more as a society


---------15:01----------
we'll talk about that and I think what


---------15:05----------
we're seeing is this epidemic of


---------15:07----------
disconnection people are hopeless


---------15:08----------
they're lonely they're depressed they


---------15:11----------
use substances they self-medicate we're


---------15:13----------
going to talk about that and so how do


---------15:19----------
we understand like what's going on so


---------15:21----------
first thing is like we're gonna talk


---------15:22----------
about risk factors for suicide so you


---------15:24----------
guys are gonna get professor Andy today


---------15:28----------
so I want you guys to think about our


---------15:30----------
community and I want you to think about


---------15:32----------
whether these things apply to us or not


---------15:35----------
risk factors for suicide Tromp has that


---------15:40----------
happened to anyone that you know is that


---------15:42----------
a part of your life physical emotional


---------15:44----------
sexual whatever mental illness I know it


---------15:48----------
sounds kind of bizarre but mental


---------15:50----------
illness is a risk factor for suicide


---------15:52----------
right not everyone who kills themselves


---------15:55----------
is actually mentally ill and that's a


---------15:58----------
strange thing to say yes it may be


---------16:02----------
conversation for a different day


---------16:03----------
substance use is that an issue in our


---------16:06----------
community you know it's interesting


---------16:08----------
because a lot of people have come


---------16:09----------
forward about a lot of you know


---------16:12----------
important secrets that need to be told


---------16:17----------
bringing things to light recently and I


---------16:19----------
think that's healthy


---------16:20----------
the one thing that shocked me was like


---------16:22----------
how common substance abuse was in all of


---------16:26----------
their stories someone's been drinking


---------16:28----------
and we got to look long and hard at the


---------16:32----------
culture we promote I've been thinking


---------16:34----------
long and hard about the drunk AMA so the


---------16:37----------
last time I had that much to drink was


---------16:39----------
3500 days ago I don't drink very much


---------16:42----------
but it occurred to me that like


---------16:45----------
I'm demonstrating that that's okay and


---------16:49----------
I'm supporting that and I don't think


---------16:51----------
that that's right I think about it so


---------16:56----------
substance use self medication let me


---------16:59----------
tell you guys something about self


---------17:00----------
medication self medication doesn't work


---------17:02----------
makes you feel good but it doesn't


---------17:04----------
actually fix the problem substances


---------17:07----------
don't fix the problem they make you feel


---------17:09----------
better and I don't blame you for using


---------17:11----------
it because sometimes you need to use it


---------17:13----------
because you've got to get through the


---------17:15----------
day you know and we certainly saw that


---------17:18----------
with byron


---------17:22----------
fix the problem so it fixes the problem


---------17:25----------
is actually working at the problem it's


---------17:27----------
mental health treatment that's what you


---------17:29----------
guys a lot of y'all need and so if


---------17:31----------
you're self-medicating think long and


---------17:33----------
hard about self medication and


---------17:36----------
medication in general is a bridge it's a


---------17:39----------
bridge to a better life but self


---------17:42----------
medication is a bridge to note


---------17:45----------
there's nothing on the other side of


---------17:47----------
that if you if you wake up every day and


---------17:48----------
you drink and you get high like what is


---------17:52----------
that leading you towards like sure it


---------17:55----------
helps and I get that your anxiety is


---------17:56----------
overwhelming but like what like where's


---------17:58----------
that going are you gonna wake up one day


---------18:00----------
and then like you don't need to get high


---------18:02----------
for your anxieties out what's gonna


---------18:04----------
happen you're gonna wake up one day and


---------18:07----------
say like oh I don't need the alcohol


---------18:08----------
anymore my problems are all fixed are


---------18:12----------
you gonna wake up one day and you're


---------18:13----------
gonna say oh I don't need to play a


---------18:15----------
video game for 14 hours today because I


---------18:17----------
don't like I have a fulfilling life and


---------18:19----------
I'm happy with who I am as a person it's


---------18:22----------
a bridge to [ __ ] number so I'm an


---------18:26----------
addiction psychiatrist and I get that


---------18:28----------
like sometimes it's hard to survive in


---------18:31----------
your mind but for [ __ ] sake start


---------18:33----------
building at least another bridge


---------18:39----------
you can't overcome


---------18:41----------
I guess you can but you know my strategy


---------18:43----------
to overcome an addiction is to make the


---------18:47----------
addiction no longer necessary


---------18:50----------
we're healthy gamer we're not treating


---------18:54----------
video game addiction we changed and


---------18:56----------
we'll talk a little bit about that too


---------19:03----------
but you have to do the other stuff too


---------19:08----------
substance use isn't a treatment self


---------19:12----------
medication isn't really medicating


---------19:14----------
anything it's just ignoring a problem


---------19:16----------
and so it's not just depression it's not


---------19:20----------
just suicide if you guys have a


---------19:22----------
substance use problem get some help


---------19:24----------
and it doesn't have to be medical like


---------19:26----------
treatment is a good thing but there are


---------19:28----------
communities like Alcoholics Anonymous


---------19:30----------
Narcotics Anonymous


---------19:32----------
you know marijuana Anonymous cvaa


---------19:36----------

---------19:38----------
and we'll talk a little bit about that


---------19:41----------
too other risk factors for suicide


---------19:46----------
suicide clusters and what does that mean


---------19:50----------
absolutely crazy but suicide is


---------19:52----------
contagious when someone kills themselves


---------19:55----------
in its prominent other people kill


---------19:58----------
themselves so something that I want


---------20:00----------
every person to understand right now is


---------20:03----------
that statistically the most likely


---------20:10----------
source of your death that you have an


---------20:12----------
influence over is you it's not someone


---------20:15----------
else it's you and over the next weeks to


---------20:22----------
months you're more likely to try to kill


---------20:27----------
yourself you were your biggest threat


---------20:29----------
and we know this so suicide clusters


---------20:33----------
have been a big problem in Japan a lot


---------20:35----------
of good literature comes out of there


---------20:36----------
but after Robin Williams passed away


---------20:39----------
people died there was actually I think


---------20:42----------
an increase in suicides after Netflix


---------20:44----------
released 13 reasons why which is a story


---------20:47----------
about suicide so understand that your


---------20:52----------
mind may be attacking you more over the


---------20:57----------
weeks to come


---------20:57----------
and I want you guys to really think


---------21:00----------
about that for a second because if your


---------21:01----------
mind starts to attack you more it also


---------21:05----------
means that your mind can attack you less


---------21:08----------
if you can get more suicidal over time


---------21:12----------
what it also means is that you can


---------21:14----------
become less suicidal


---------21:16----------
over time and that's I know it sounds


---------21:19----------
like so simple but in the mind of a


---------21:21----------
suicidal person they believe that the


---------21:23----------
downward trend is gonna go forever and


---------21:25----------
that's where hopelessness comes but


---------21:27----------
that's just not true


---------21:29----------
if suicidality is a fluctuating


---------21:31----------
attribute in your mind it doesn't just


---------21:34----------
go downward it's gonna go up at some


---------21:36----------
point all things in the mind come to an


---------21:39----------
end that is the nature of the mind


---------21:41----------
everyone's crying a lot right now


---------21:43----------
everyone is sorry in 2077 we're not


---------21:46----------
going to be that sad it's just the way


---------21:50----------
of the mind sometimes there are


---------21:52----------
celebrations and then your mind feels


---------21:55----------
wonderful and then that changes this is


---------21:58----------
something that you guys have to


---------21:59----------
understand the mind returns to


---------22:03----------
equilibrium you just have to buy it


---------22:05----------
enough time give yourself time talk to


---------22:10----------
someone else let them help you get get


---------22:13----------
back to the equilibria ting mind I know


---------22:16----------
it feels like it's hopeless I know it


---------22:19----------
feels like it's forever because that's


---------22:20----------
what mental illness does to us it makes


---------22:23----------
us feel like the present is eternal but


---------22:26----------
that's just not [ __ ] true it's just


---------22:30----------
not true it feels like kovat is gonna go


---------22:32----------
on forever i mean maybe but it's not


---------22:34----------
gonna go on forever it feels like it but


---------22:38----------
that's just not how it works things


---------22:40----------
change over time that is the nature of


---------22:42----------
time things change and so just buy


---------22:45----------
yourself time don't do it today and then


---------22:50----------
tomorrow don't do it that day reach out


---------22:54----------
to people and give yourself time and


---------22:56----------
recognize that your you may need mental


---------22:59----------
health treatment now more than ever and


---------23:02----------
so we're gonna talk about that in a


---------23:05----------
second but so what are the other risk


---------23:08----------
factors isolation sound familiar


---------23:11----------
a sense of loss unwillingness to seek


---------23:15----------
help feeling hopeless that are a couple


---------23:17----------
of others so no water we're killing


---------23:22----------
ourselves more that's us


---------23:23----------
that's twitch that's our community we're


---------23:27----------
disconnected we feel hopeless we smoke


---------23:31----------
pot a lot of us have dealt with abuse


---------23:38----------
and so this is us we're isolated but


---------23:43----------
here's the cool thing so I live in a


---------23:46----------
world where I truly do believe that we


---------23:49----------
are never given a challenge without the


---------23:51----------
tools to overcome it and like that's


---------23:54----------
kind of a weird belief as an optimism no


---------23:56----------
I don't think it's optimism I think it's


---------23:58----------
actually a deep principle of karma or


---------24:01----------
physics that if you take a neutron and


---------24:04----------
you split off a positron you're left


---------24:08----------
with an electron right that like you


---------24:12----------
can't move from neutrality without


---------24:14----------
creating like positive and negative that


---------24:19----------
in order for ice to cool a drink it has


---------24:22----------
to warm up everything has two sides like


---------24:27----------
that's just an attribute of nature


---------24:29----------
there's no like one side of anything in


---------24:34----------
order for me to get calories I have to


---------24:38----------
eat something else energy is neither


---------24:41----------
created nor destroyed largely true of


---------24:45----------
matter isn't power and so I think that


---------24:47----------
that's like a deep principle of our


---------24:49----------
universe which applies to like really


---------24:52----------
really bizarre kind of like


---------24:54----------
psychological stock way down the road


---------24:56----------
and y'all are welcome to disagree with


---------24:58----------
that but in my life I have truly


---------25:00----------
believed that we are given the tools to


---------25:03----------
overcome our challenges that it's the


---------25:05----------
challenge that creates the tool why are


---------25:07----------
we here at healthy gamer like we are


---------25:10----------
here at healthy gamer because the the


---------25:12----------
soil was fertile for us to grow is


---------25:15----------
interesting because Bobby Skaar said


---------25:18----------
like I predicted your coming I saw you


---------25:20----------
or like I knew you were gonna come how


---------25:23----------
can you do that because that's what


---------25:24----------
happens right like in terms of civil


---------25:26----------
rights or black lives matter police


---------25:30----------
brutality is the negative side of like


---------25:34----------
these protests and black lives matter we


---------25:40----------
have the tools to overcome our


---------25:41----------
challenges and that's not like optimism


---------25:43----------
it's like it's deeper than that it's not


---------25:47----------
a belief it's like a truth and so we


---------25:52----------
we struggle with an epidemic of


---------25:53----------
disconnection and so what are our


---------25:56----------
weapons right because like when you're


---------25:59----------
like the final boss is like mental


---------26:02----------
health like and that's what I mean about


---------26:04----------
all this physical stuff like we've


---------26:05----------
conquered the body we [ __ ] conquered


---------26:08----------
it like just think you don't need your


---------26:12----------
heart to survive anymore if your heart


---------26:14----------
is [ __ ] we can literally take your heart


---------26:17----------
out of your body and stick another one


---------26:19----------
in there the final boss is mental health


---------26:24----------
and that's where we are in society we're


---------26:26----------
at the end of the game it's like


---------26:28----------
late-game civilization where like at the


---------26:31----------
beginning it's like you're fighting


---------26:32----------
against wolves and [ __ ] and eventually


---------26:34----------
it's like we get to this this is the


---------26:36----------
final boss this is the final boss you


---------26:43----------
know universal basic income people don't


---------26:46----------
need to work anymore we grow food


---------26:50----------
hydroponically and we can grow way more


---------26:53----------
food vertically than we can grow like


---------26:55----------
horizontal you just think about as a


---------26:56----------
society when we start growing food in a


---------26:59----------
vertical dimension we don't need people


---------27:02----------
to work like [ __ ] is automated now we're


---------27:04----------
gonna have self-driving cars what's left


---------27:06----------
the mind that's the final bus this is it


---------27:09----------
this is the climax this is the raid boss


---------27:12----------
this is the end of the game that's the


---------27:14----------
boss that we're fighting and you're damn


---------27:16----------
right it's hard because the final boss


---------27:18----------
is the hardest because we can't use


---------27:20----------
science


---------27:21----------
I can't biopsy your depression and just


---------27:25----------
give you a pill to make it go away


---------27:26----------
because depression is complicated mental


---------27:28----------
health treatment is a part of it but


---------27:30----------
there's more to it what are our weapons


---------27:34----------
clinical care is number one


---------27:35----------
that's psychiatry mental health


---------27:38----------
treatment but protective factors against


---------27:41----------
suicide


---------27:42----------
clinical care is at the top of the list


---------27:43----------
go [ __ ] get treatment if you feel bad


---------27:47----------
about what it is or if you feel


---------27:48----------
stigmatized or you're like you don't


---------27:50----------
know how to do that


---------27:51----------
don't worry alone talk to someone about


---------27:53----------
it weapon number two protective factors


---------27:59----------
against suicide success to support


---------28:01----------
structures this is what our


---------28:04----------
responsibility


---------28:05----------
is an online community and I just don't


---------28:07----------
mean helping anyone I mean twitch


---------28:09----------
I mean steam I mean whatever take your


---------28:11----------
pick that we support each other I want


---------28:15----------
you guys to think about this who here


---------28:17----------
has ever met reckful you got a never met


---------28:19----------
the [ __ ] guy you guys have never met


---------28:20----------
me how can I do anything for you


---------28:23----------
just think about how awesome this tool


---------28:26----------
is at our disposal that you can watch


---------28:29----------
another human being in a different


---------28:31----------
country not even talk to you just


---------28:34----------
[ __ ] talk Hatun and you can feel


---------28:36----------
connected to them and you can grieve


---------28:38----------
their loss so hold on a second because


---------28:40----------
that's that's a [ __ ] nuke against the


---------28:44----------
final boss because we can form


---------28:46----------
connections with each other that are


---------28:48----------
real and powerful without ever beating


---------28:50----------
each other that we're we're a society


---------28:53----------
that doesn't need to leave the house


---------28:54----------
between ubereats grocery delivery and


---------28:57----------
Amazon to day delivery you never need to


---------28:59----------
leave and so we become isolated and at


---------29:02----------
the same time we've got a weapon against


---------29:04----------
that because the computer is what


---------29:06----------
isolates us and that's what gives us the


---------29:08----------
opportunity for connection skills and


---------29:16----------
problem-solving actually protect a


---------29:18----------
factor against suicide we're good at


---------29:21----------
that we're good at solving problems


---------29:24----------
that's our Forte we're [ __ ] smart the


---------29:28----------
study done by the Department of Defense


---------29:30----------
found that people who play video games


---------29:31----------
are ten to twenty percent smarter than


---------29:33----------
people who don't


---------29:34----------
among soldiers seriously our intellect


---------29:39----------
is one of our greatest weapons and


---------29:40----------
that's why depression is so devastating


---------29:42----------
because that's when we turn it against


---------29:44----------
ourselves it's hard right it's like mind


---------29:48----------
control like if you guys think about


---------29:49----------
mind control in video games right like


---------29:54----------
you like charm and enemy and then they


---------29:56----------
like they fight for you and if they


---------29:58----------
charm you then you fight for them and


---------30:00----------
the stronger the character is that gets


---------30:03----------
charmed the more screen you are so our


---------30:07----------
mind is our greatest weapon and it's


---------30:08----------
also our greatest enemy


---------30:12----------
cultural beliefs religious beliefs


---------30:14----------
that's actually on both sides that can


---------30:15----------
be a risk factor or a protective factor


---------30:17----------
so I don't know what we believe about


---------30:20----------
suicide I think our culture is evolving


---------30:21----------
and we've got to think a little bit


---------30:23----------
about that so let's talk about that for


---------30:25----------
a second what is our culture so what is


---------30:35----------
our culture


---------30:39----------
how do we how do we act how do we treat


---------30:42----------
each other


---------30:45----------
to think long and hard about this so


---------30:46----------
with all this stuff with like sexual


---------30:47----------
harassment sexual assault coming out a


---------30:49----------
lot of people ask how could this happen


---------30:52----------
how could this happen


---------30:54----------
how did the tournament organizers not


---------30:56----------
know how twitch should do this about it


---------30:58----------
Emmett cheer should resign if all this


---------31:00----------
didn't stop right like blaming everyone


---------31:03----------
you can how could this happen what makes


---------31:08----------
our culture we do so when when someone


---------31:12----------
we had female game gamers on stream this


---------31:14----------
Monday and they kind of said like you


---------31:17----------
know if they speak in boys chat they get


---------31:20----------
toxic responses and people call them in


---------31:22----------
all kinds of I want to stick my


---------31:23----------
blankety-blank in your blankety-blank


---------31:25----------
and then there are two things that that


---------31:28----------
happen right so one is that like


---------31:30----------
sometimes like most people just don't


---------31:31----------
speak up and then sometimes they get a


---------31:34----------
white knight which is just as bad and


---------31:35----------
they're like m'lady let me fedora


---------31:38----------
your face and let me defend humanity


---------31:40----------
just treat them like humans let me tell


---------31:43----------
you you guys are gonna know how we stop


---------31:44----------
toxicity on the internet you know how to


---------31:46----------
make gaming a safe place for women it's


---------31:48----------
actually really really really simple


---------31:51----------
when one person is toxic towards a woman


---------31:56----------
you don't have to attack them you don't


---------31:58----------
have to defend you got to say hey man do


---------32:01----------
you think you can call it a little bit


---------32:02----------
like do you really think what you're


---------32:03----------
doing is decent and then what do they do


---------32:04----------
they start calling you as soon fine you


---------32:07----------
let them you don't have to fight them


---------32:09----------
you don't have to convince them you


---------32:10----------
don't have to do any of that [ __ ] you


---------32:11----------
don't have to show them you're right


---------32:12----------
though that's all you say like hey man


---------32:14----------
can you lay off and then if he keeps


---------32:15----------
going you can apologize to the woman you


---------32:17----------
could say hey I'm sorry you have to deal


---------32:19----------
with this sounds like it sucks I can


---------32:21----------
only imagine if there's something I can


---------32:22----------
do let me know that's all you got to say


---------32:24----------
30 seconds of speech and then he can get


---------32:26----------
mad at you why does he get mad at


---------32:27----------
because you're [ __ ] right does that


---------32:30----------
solve the problem no in the next game


---------32:33----------
there needs to be someone else like you


---------32:34----------
and in the next game there needs to be


---------32:36----------
someone else like you and I guarantee


---------32:38----------
you that if that person plays ten games


---------32:43----------
in a row where there is a single person


---------32:45----------
that's like hey man why don't you lay


---------32:47----------
off they're gonna shut the [ __ ] up on


---------32:49----------
game 11 they're not even gonna do it you


---------32:51----------
and I are gonna convince them of


---------32:52----------
anything that's how we solve toxicity


---------32:57----------
it's not


---------32:59----------
tournament organizers it's not twitch


---------33:01----------
it's not streamers it's [ __ ] you and


---------33:05----------
you think about when you've been hateful


---------33:07----------
and you think about when you've been


---------33:10----------
toxic and when you've grabbed your


---------33:12----------
pitchfork friends let me explain


---------33:13----------
something to you if someone who is


---------33:15----------
sexually assaulted is not grabbing their


---------33:17----------
pitchfork


---------33:18----------
you better [ __ ] put yours down the


---------33:21----------
right to justice and judgement is the


---------33:23----------
party who's aggrieved


---------33:25----------
not the person browsing reddit and I


---------33:29----------
think you do have an individual


---------33:30----------
responsibility and like I think it's


---------33:32----------
good that you advocate for people and


---------33:33----------
sometimes people are so [ __ ] up that


---------33:36----------
they can't advocate for themselves and


---------33:37----------
then you do need to grab their pitchfork


---------33:39----------
because they're not bringing theirs I'll


---------33:41----------
admit that that's that's absolutely a


---------33:43----------
scenario but for the most part that


---------33:47----------
should be the minority and if someone


---------33:49----------
says hey I forgive this person I don't


---------33:51----------
want you guys to tar and feather them


---------33:53----------
you all should think about that like who


---------33:55----------
are you to say otherwise and as you look


---------33:58----------
at yourself I think you're gonna


---------34:00----------
discover all kinds of important things


---------34:02----------
that the beef that you're fighting has


---------34:05----------
nothing to do with them it has to do


---------34:06----------
with a beef of your own life and that's


---------34:08----------
what you need to fix


---------34:09----------
where does hatred come from where does


---------34:12----------
anger come from do we just grow up


---------34:14----------
hating people sure some of it is


---------34:16----------
conditioned


---------34:16----------
some of it is and gets conditioned by


---------34:19----------
the culture right why do why do people


---------34:22----------
call or wire people toxic to women in


---------34:25----------
video games it's because no one stops


---------34:26----------
them and other people are and we see the


---------34:29----------
wide difference in different kinds of


---------34:31----------
communities I'm not gonna like name


---------34:33----------
different communities but just go and


---------34:35----------
look at different streamers see the kind


---------34:37----------
of communities they cultivate how do


---------34:39----------
they do that it's because of the way


---------34:40----------
that they act it's because of the


---------34:42----------
participants like I don't know if you


---------34:43----------
guys get this but I don't create the


---------34:44----------
community I don't even participate in


---------34:46----------
the community you guys are the community


---------34:48----------
the credit for the health of the healthy


---------34:51----------
gamer community goes to you doesn't go


---------34:53----------
to MIT and if you're a part of a toxic


---------34:57----------
community the blame goes to the


---------35:01----------
community it goes to you and so everyone


---------35:04----------
is sort of saying like how could this


---------35:05----------
happen it's such a systemic problem


---------35:08----------
toxicity and like like you know sexual


---------35:10----------
assault and sexual harassment


---------35:12----------
and at gaming right it's not just fair


---------35:14----------
it's like everywhere and if it's a


---------35:18----------
systemic problem


---------35:19----------
it needs a systemic solution and a


---------35:21----------
systemic solution means you need to get


---------35:23----------
the [ __ ] up off your chair and get


---------35:25----------
involved and when it comes to depression


---------35:27----------
and suicide and disconnection you have


---------35:30----------
two very important responsibilities one


---------35:32----------
is that you take care of yourself and


---------35:34----------
the second is you try to take care of


---------35:36----------
other people so cultural beliefs are a


---------35:46----------
protective factor of suicide so the


---------35:49----------
question that I have for you is what is


---------35:51----------
our cultural belief about suicide


---------35:53----------
how are we going to treat it do we think


---------35:56----------
it's okay or not okay are we gonna reach


---------35:58----------
out to someone are we not going to reach


---------35:59----------
out to someone let me ask you guys a an


---------36:01----------
interesting question what is the best


---------36:04----------
way for you to get someone else to


---------36:07----------
disclose their suicidal thoughts to you


---------36:13----------
any idea ask them is incorrect listen is


---------36:24----------
incorrect are you good is incorrect are


---------36:28----------
you okay is incorrect


---------36:33----------
Trust is wrong you disclose yours first


---------36:38----------
so [ __ ] you model the behavior


---------36:45----------
you be vulnerable you share and if


---------36:48----------
you're not suicidal don't share that


---------36:49----------
share something else


---------36:50----------
don't worry alone


---------36:54----------
remember that your struggles are a


---------36:56----------
multiplayer game - if you want to help


---------36:58----------
someone else start by asking for their


---------37:01----------
help because think about this this is


---------37:03----------
fine I have hope because everyone looks


---------37:06----------
at this gaming community and they see


---------37:07----------
toxicity that's not pricey because it


---------37:11----------
boggles my mind how little y'all take


---------37:13----------
care of yourselves and how hard you work


---------37:16----------
to take care of other people it's


---------37:17----------
[ __ ] amazing right let you think


---------37:20----------
about what you're not willing to do for


---------37:23----------
yourself but you're willing to do for


---------37:25----------
other people like this is a community


---------37:27----------
that can beat the final boss because at


---------37:32----------
the end of the day when we separate you


---------37:34----------
from your toxic environment y'all are


---------37:36----------
good people and so we've got a chance


---------37:42----------
like sure it's the final boss but like


---------37:44----------
we've got what it takes because at the


---------37:50----------
end of the day I've been looking for God


---------37:53----------
awfulness within this community from day


---------37:56----------
one we've asked like in cells and a dude


---------38:01----------
with a waifu to come on and if there


---------38:03----------
isn't some degenerate [ __ ] on the


---------38:04----------
internet isn't it that kind of stuff and


---------38:07----------
these people shockingly turn out to be


---------38:09----------
decent and normal human beings because


---------38:11----------
we all are and as long as you like date


---------38:13----------
like just peel a couple of layers of the


---------38:15----------
onion back you're gonna find decency


---------38:17----------
underneath if that wasn't the case


---------38:20----------
healthy gamer would be nowhere so give


---------38:26----------
yourself a chance to be a decent human


---------38:28----------
being


---------38:29----------
give yourself a chance to be vulnerable


---------38:31----------
give a chance give yourself do people


---------38:34----------
the favor of letting them help think


---------38:41----------
about that for a second if someone's


---------38:46----------
like hey man like how you have the


---------38:49----------
capacity to make someone feel like they


---------38:51----------
have purpose in life if you let them


---------38:53----------
help you cuz if you help someone out


---------38:56----------
like if someone like if your friend has


---------38:58----------
a flat tire and they call you and you're


---------39:00----------
like absolutely man I'll be there you


---------39:01----------
change the flat tire they go home how do


---------39:04----------
you feel about yourself after that you


---------39:06----------
feel damn good B and you should


---------39:08----------
you have worth you can see your worth in


---------39:11----------
the world the problem is that we don't


---------39:12----------
give ourselves opportunities to see all


---------39:14----------
worth in the world and to lean on


---------39:18----------
someone else for support go for it it'll


---------39:20----------
help you and it'll help them so kind of


---------39:29----------
going back to suicide so let me say this


---------39:31----------
so reckless suicide was absolutely a


---------39:34----------
tragedy and it wasn't the first and it's


---------39:39----------
not going to be the last so as a


---------39:43----------
psychiatrist when I interview people I


---------39:45----------
don't know what the risk factors of


---------39:47----------
suicide are and I know that pretty much


---------39:50----------
every person that we interview checks a


---------39:52----------
lot of those boxes I know that because I


---------39:55----------
used to check a lot of those boxes and I


---------39:58----------
know that like before I even showed up


---------39:59----------
on stream I've worked with hundreds of


---------40:01----------
gamers who checked a lot of those boxes


---------40:03----------
in reckful suicide was a tragedy but I


---------40:07----------
don't think you guys get this we as a


---------40:10----------
community or literally killing ourselves


---------40:11----------
that's not a metaphor it's not a


---------40:13----------
hyperbole it's not an exaggeration the


---------40:17----------
second leading cause of death for people


---------40:19----------
between the age of 10 and 34 is suicide


---------40:24----------
after random-ass accidents that no one


---------40:26----------
can do anything about it's us that are


---------40:28----------
killing ourselves and this is the thing


---------40:30----------
people don't realize this because look


---------40:32----------
at chat right now look at how many


---------40:34----------
people are here and if one of them kills


---------40:36----------
themselves tomorrow who's gonna know not


---------40:39----------
a single [ __ ] person it's happening


---------40:42----------
just because we see it doesn't mean it's


---------40:44----------
happening and it's not going to be the


---------40:47----------
last so we've got to do more


---------40:54----------
so what can you do the first thing is


---------40:57----------
let someone else help you


---------40:59----------
second thing is help yourself third


---------41:03----------
thing is help someone else in terms of


---------41:07----------
helping yourself if you guys have any


---------41:09----------
medical professional in your life tell


---------41:12----------
them if you're struggling with


---------41:13----------
depression does it [ __ ] matter it


---------41:14----------
could be a physical therapist doesn't


---------41:16----------
matter if you have a doctor tell them


---------41:19----------
that you're struggling there are


---------41:21----------
resources I think we have a


---------41:23----------
exclamation-point support kind of thing


---------41:26----------
talk to your doctor you can also call


---------41:29----------
your insurance company if you have


---------41:30----------
insurance and say hey I wanna you know


---------41:34----------
who's a how can I see a therapist and


---------41:36----------
they'll walk you through the process you


---------41:37----------
can go to a website like Psychology


---------41:40----------
Today or better help or talk space and


---------41:42----------
sign up for stop and just like browse


---------41:44----------
profiles and like call people you can


---------41:47----------
there's weird it's good you guys may not


---------41:50----------
be very familiar with this but there's


---------41:52----------
um there's a website called google GOOG


---------41:56----------
le and it's cool you can just type in


---------42:00----------
anything in there and it'll give you


---------42:02----------
information about it so you can even


---------42:04----------
like it's it's actually like a pretty


---------42:05----------
sophisticated website it looks simple


---------42:07----------
but they just have this box and if you


---------42:10----------
type in therapists and then your


---------42:11----------
location it'll give you like a list of


---------42:15----------
therapists in your location it's pretty


---------42:16----------
cool


---------42:16----------
it's kind of like a personal assistant


---------42:18----------
sort of website so you guys can try


---------42:22----------
using that too


---------42:26----------
the other thing that you can do if you


---------42:28----------
guys are struggling is you don't have to


---------42:29----------
talk to a mental health professional


---------42:30----------
talk to a friend say hey I think I mean


---------42:32----------
I should maybe see a therapist but I


---------42:33----------
don't know how and this is the funny


---------42:37----------
thing right so look at what your mind


---------42:38----------
does if you think about how do I see a


---------42:40----------
therapist you don't know how to figure


---------42:41----------
it out if a friend comes to you and says


---------42:43----------
how do I see a therapist you're on that


---------42:45----------
ship you'll figure not for them you can


---------42:48----------
use that 10 to 20 percent gaming IQ buff


---------42:50----------
to solve a problem for them if you can't


---------42:54----------
afford it this is why organizations like


---------42:57----------
rise above the disorder exist there are


---------42:59----------
also some free clinics that offer mental


---------43:01----------
health care so at Google you can even


---------43:03----------
try to type like free mental health care


---------43:05----------
in your city or call someone


---------43:08----------
right so like a lot of providers will


---------43:11----------
see people for free who can't afford it


---------43:13----------
you just have to ask half of the


---------43:15----------
patients in my practice I see for free


---------43:24----------
so just ask okay so next thing healthy


---------43:31----------
gamer so mental health for gamers by


---------43:35----------
gamers that's what we're about at


---------43:37----------
healthy gamer and so what are we are we


---------43:41----------
treatment absolutely not


---------43:43----------
so what are we how can we do mental


---------43:46----------
health for gamers if we're not treatment


---------43:47----------
aren't we telling people oh like are we


---------43:50----------
pretending to be therapists and we're


---------43:52----------
not therapists absolutely not so the


---------43:55----------
reason that the final boss grew up in


---------43:57----------
the first place is because somewhere


---------43:59----------
along the way we put all of the burden


---------44:02----------
on mental health on providers and as a


---------44:04----------
society we gave up on mental health and


---------44:07----------
we said for all mental problems go see a


---------44:10----------
psychiatrist and that's the only


---------44:11----------
solution that we have and I want you


---------44:13----------
guys to think about how idiotic this is


---------44:15----------
people are like oh like dr. K like does


---------44:19----------
therapy on so you don't do therapy on


---------44:20----------
stream it's not therapy what I do is I


---------44:23----------
have human conversations with people


---------44:25----------
about what's going on in their life that


---------44:28----------
doesn't make me a therapist that makes


---------44:30----------
me a decent human being in the fact that


---------44:33----------
what you guys think I do is therapy


---------44:36----------
speaks to the problem that like what I


---------44:39----------
do should be [ __ ] normal that's


---------44:42----------
what's wrong


---------44:45----------
and just think about this for a second


---------44:47----------
is all physical health medicine


---------44:53----------
you


---------44:54----------
is all mental health psychiatry


---------45:00----------
daran lies the problem now we know how


---------45:02----------
the raid boss got so big because there's


---------45:07----------
like exercise and diet we acknowledge


---------45:10----------
that there are nutritionists and


---------45:11----------
personal trainers that can help you be


---------45:14----------
physically healthy is it medical


---------45:16----------
treatment absolutely not


---------45:18----------
does it prevent or treat heart disease


---------45:21----------
absolutely so what's missing in our


---------45:25----------
society and this is why I like life


---------45:27----------
coaching and executive coaching and all


---------45:29----------
this kind of crap has popped up because


---------45:32----------
there are things involving your mental


---------45:33----------
health that don't have to be therapy or


---------45:36----------
treatment that people I know this is


---------45:39----------
shocking there's a depression which is a


---------45:41----------
clinical illness and then there is


---------45:43----------
unhappiness which is not and what's our


---------45:46----------
antidote to unhappiness we don't have


---------45:51----------
one well why the [ __ ] not right so in


---------45:55----------
Western medicine


---------45:57----------
we're not health care we're sick care


---------46:01----------
like if you think about exercise


---------46:02----------
exercise sure helps you if you're


---------46:04----------
unhealthy but once you hit like the


---------46:06----------
neutral point exercise can elevate you


---------46:09----------
to be super healthy and what's missing


---------46:12----------
in our society is that elevation and


---------46:14----------
that's what we do in healthy gamer what


---------46:17----------
people I don't think people really get


---------46:18----------
this but most of what I draw on and


---------46:20----------
healthy gamer is not psychiatry it's


---------46:23----------
yoga it's meditation it's wood duh what


---------46:27----------
we talk about is finding purpose finding


---------46:29----------
hope finding meaning learning under to


---------46:32----------
understand how your mind works what I


---------46:34----------
teach is not psychiatry it's engineering


---------46:37----------
of the mind that's what we do


---------46:41----------
yoga chitta vritti nirodh aha' Yoga is


---------46:46----------
the cessation of fluctuations of the


---------46:48----------
mind and that is what I try to teach


---------46:51----------
first and foremost what does that mean


---------46:55----------
fluctuations of the mind suicidality


---------46:57----------
comes and goes the mine has fluctuations


---------47:01----------
happiness joy sadness disappointment


---------47:04----------
excitement all fluctuations peace comes


---------47:09----------
from cessation of fluctuations of the


---------47:11----------
mind that is first and foremost what I


---------47:14----------
try to teach the rest of it is just


---------47:16----------
supportive whether it be psychology


---------47:18----------
psychiatry neuroscience medicine


---------47:21----------
physiology spirituality my end goal if


---------47:26----------
you want to be a healthy gamer yoga


---------47:28----------
chitta vritti nirodh aha' sees the


---------47:32----------
fluctuations of your mind and you will


---------47:34----------
be at peace when someone is depressed


---------47:36----------
and suicidal their mind is very deviated


---------47:38----------
from the north


---------47:41----------
that's what we do at a healthy gamer


---------47:48----------
we want to teach you how you work we


---------47:51----------
want to teach you how to understand


---------47:52----------
yourself y'all are playing a game with


---------47:55----------
the monitor turned off


---------47:57----------
you don't know what's going on you're


---------47:59----------
just [ __ ] mashing buttons without any


---------48:01----------
idea how anything works that's why


---------48:04----------
you're losing


---------48:06----------
we're here to teach you how to turn the


---------48:08----------
monitor on and do we talk about emotions


---------48:11----------
absolutely does that make it therapy I


---------48:13----------
don't think so


---------48:16----------
because like emotions are not the


---------48:19----------
province of medicine like I don't know


---------48:20----------
if you guys get this but long human


---------48:21----------
beings have emotions so does anything


---------48:26----------
involving emotions make it medical


---------48:28----------
treatment no like that's the problem is


---------48:30----------
that we think that like you can't like


---------48:33----------
you can process your emotions with a


---------48:35----------
therapist absolutely you can also do a


---------48:37----------
lot of other things for your mental


---------48:39----------
health that do not involve treatment and


---------48:41----------
that's what's missing in our society in


---------48:44----------
addition to stigma and all that stuff so


---------48:46----------
think about how you take care of your


---------48:49----------
mind how do you take care of you


---------48:54----------
do you lean on other people for support


---------48:56----------
do you do things that are good for you


---------48:59----------
do you help yourself out are you just


---------49:03----------
[ __ ] afk when it comes to yourself


---------49:06----------
because the answer is yes you are and


---------49:08----------
that needs to change


---------49:14----------
so when it comes to healthy gamer this


---------49:18----------
discussion is incomplete without reckful


---------49:22----------
so reckful put us on the map 99% of you


---------49:26----------
are here today because of reckful our


---------49:29----------
average viewer count priori reckful was


---------49:32----------
100 after rectal it was 2000


---------49:39----------
he's the guy gave us the term AoE


---------49:41----------
healing and he gave people hope but why


---------49:46----------
didn't healthy gamer blow up it's


---------49:49----------
because reckful came on and he was like


---------49:52----------
honest and authentic and like he let


---------49:55----------
people see him and like this is he was


---------50:00----------
the start of the silver bullet against


---------50:04----------
the disease of connection disconnection


---------50:06----------
because what what happened with reckful


---------50:08----------
is people connected to him they said


---------50:10----------
that's not him that's me and we're so


---------50:15----------
separate and what we need is to be


---------50:18----------
together and I don't mean that in like a


---------50:21----------
[ __ ] inspirational calendar kind of


---------50:24----------
way I mean like very practically like we


---------50:27----------
need to connect to each other and it is


---------50:29----------
amazing that he was able to do that and


---------50:33----------
people thanked me and like sure so I'll


---------50:36----------
take some things but what I really want


---------50:38----------
you guys to understand this healthy


---------50:40----------
gamer is not about me it's about you I


---------50:42----------
just ask questions the information and


---------50:46----------
what the learning comes from the person


---------50:49----------
that I'm talking to and he absolutely


---------50:54----------
gave people hope and people were like


---------50:55----------
man I'm gonna see a therapist like if


---------50:57----------
reckful can get help like I can get help


---------50:59----------
he gave us hope right but it wasn't


---------51:04----------
enough he had everything he had money he


---------51:11----------
had fame he had adoration he even had


---------51:14----------
six streams with dr. King and it wasn't


---------51:19----------
enough and so he gave you hope and he


---------51:23----------
killed himself does that mean that you


---------51:26----------
shouldn't lose hope makes sense right


---------51:30----------
because reckful had it all


---------51:35----------
should you lose help


---------51:39----------
makes sense he's gone he's what got us


---------51:42----------
started


---------51:45----------
but I don't think you should what's up


---------51:47----------
and once again not because of a positive


---------51:50----------
calendar kind of way but I want you to


---------51:52----------
think about this because if he can lose


---------51:56----------
the battle


---------51:57----------
you can and what do I mean by that


---------52:00----------
reckful had money he had fame he had


---------52:02----------
adoration and access to dr. kay


---------52:07----------
and what I want you guys to understand


---------52:09----------
is if that month if money doesn't buy


---------52:11----------
happiness then being broke doesn't cause


---------52:16----------
you to lose happiness right these are


---------52:20----------
independent variables are they a factor


---------52:23----------
with each other absolutely but if he can


---------52:27----------
lose you can win right now you guys look


---------52:30----------
at your life and you say if only this


---------52:32----------
was different then I would be happy but


---------52:36----------
what I want you guys to really


---------52:37----------
understand about byron is all of those


---------52:39----------
things were different about him and he


---------52:42----------
still wasn't it wasn't enough but the


---------52:45----------
cool thing is that like that's


---------52:46----------
devastating in some way but I want you


---------52:47----------
guys to really understand that means


---------52:49----------
that the struggle against depression and


---------52:52----------
suicide and fighting that war means that


---------52:55----------
you at the end of the day it's about you


---------52:57----------
it's a personal struggle and money like


---------53:00----------
sure money helps because you're gonna


---------53:01----------
have access to resources and things like


---------53:02----------
that but for someone to be so loved and


---------53:05----------
also so and to still lose means that you


---------53:10----------
actually have hope


---------53:15----------
so if money doesn't buy happiness then


---------53:18----------
being broke doesn't buy sadness and at


---------53:23----------
the end of the day there is nothing you


---------53:25----------
can do to afk at this game


---------53:30----------
you've got to fight it like it doesn't


---------53:32----------
matter whether you have advantages or


---------53:34----------
disadvantages whether you've got a suite


---------53:36----------
like epic sword or you've got some like


---------53:38----------
half broken piece of trash like you've


---------53:41----------
got to fight the battle it doesn't


---------53:42----------
matter and no amount of anything that


---------53:45----------
anyone can give you ultimately makes it


---------53:48----------
so that you do not have to pick up and


---------53:50----------
fight you've got to fight that bad


---------53:55----------
and it is a personal battle but you guys


---------54:00----------
don't have to fight it alone


---------54:03----------
and I think that despite all of reckful


---------54:08----------
'he's out of everything that he gave to


---------54:11----------
us i think at the end of it


---------54:13----------
and unfortunately he was fighting it


---------54:16----------
alone and he lost but just because he


---------54:19----------
lost doesn't mean that you have to so


---------54:24----------
what happens when a champion Falls he


---------54:29----------
gave us so much like I remember you know


---------54:32----------
being like a 20 year old kid playing Wow


---------54:34----------
and like watching his videos and I was


---------54:35----------
like damn that guy's awesome like I wish


---------54:37----------
I could be like that good Wow


---------54:38----------
I was a fan he was a friend of mine and


---------54:41----------
what do we do in a champion false so we


---------54:45----------
stop talking it's a personal battle and


---------54:50----------
all of us have to fight it but you have


---------54:53----------
to fight it but you don't have to fight


---------54:54----------
it alone you absolutely don't have to


---------54:58----------
fight it alone and I don't want you to


---------55:01----------
fight it alone and I'm not going to let


---------55:02----------
you fight alone


---------55:06----------
I'm gonna fight with but I can't I can't


---------55:10----------
I can't do it alone


---------55:15----------
so I've got a pretty big HP pool I've


---------55:21----------
got 100 hit points I lost 80 of them


---------55:23----------
yesterday


---------55:29----------
I lost most of my HP bar and I'm you


---------55:37----------
know it's kind of like if it came when


---------55:39----------
so my HP bars flashing and my UI is like


---------55:43----------
red at the corners so I can't take much


---------55:46----------
more of this and every time I work with


---------55:51----------
someone I I give a piece of myself to


---------55:54----------
them and yesterday the piece that I had


---------55:58----------
given to rectal died with him and what


---------56:06----------
causes me to lose life is when y'all


---------56:10----------
lose life so spirit like link [ __ ] and


---------56:14----------
what causes me the game life is when


---------56:16----------
y'all came and I can do a lot guys I


---------56:21----------
really can and I tried with reckful I


---------56:23----------
really did but I can't do this alone


---------56:27----------
because at the end of the day I'm not


---------56:29----------
superhuman I'm just me I have two hands


---------56:34----------
I have one heart I have one voice I have


---------56:37----------
two ears I'm human I want to be more


---------56:43----------
than human I try to be superhuman but


---------56:47----------
I'm not and we think about reckful is


---------56:56----------
superhuman but he wasn't either so this


---------57:01----------
is the thing guys I can't do this alone


---------57:03----------
and I can't take much more of it and so


---------57:08----------
what I need you guys to do first and


---------57:09----------
foremost is live cuz every time y'all


---------57:14----------
died piece of me diced that's what


---------57:18----------
happens a piece of us died yesterday


---------57:24----------
and I need your help I need to do it and


---------57:28----------
I need everything that we do here to be


---------57:30----------
worth it Mitchell we get better because


---------57:33----------
I could do this look each I did you look


---------57:44----------
like a boat making it your life that's


---------57:46----------
what keeps me oh I can't take much more


---------57:50----------
sad because I'm a human I gave a piece


---------57:57----------
of myself to each and every one of you


---------58:00----------
and I give it willingly but I don't have


---------58:05----------
that much left to give


---------58:06----------
I just can't guys I'm sorry it reckful


---------58:15----------
gave us the best part of him I don't


---------58:16----------
know if you guys realize that he worked


---------58:20----------
hard and he struggled with this for


---------58:22----------
decades ever since his brother killed


---------58:26----------
himself and with Everland he tried to


---------58:29----------
create what he needed as a child what


---------58:32----------
was ever land it was a place of


---------58:34----------
connection and he gave the best part of


---------58:39----------
himself for us


---------58:41----------
streaming connecting building Everland


---------58:45----------
giving us enjoyment


---------58:48----------
he didn't leave enough for himself


---------58:58----------
so really what you guys need to do is be


---------59:01----------
better take care of yourselves the last


---------59:08----------
thing that he's giving us with his death


---------59:11----------
is a call touch what are you doing the


---------59:16----------
champion balls you thought you'd pick up


---------59:18----------
you fight you eat you don't give up and


---------59:28----------
if we fight before you do better reach


---------59:31----------
you with this war but you don't [ __ ]


---------59:35----------
stop


---------59:36----------
and just because he did doesn't mean


---------59:39----------
that we have to and there's a part of me


---------59:44----------
that says that you know you shouldn't


---------59:46----------
blame yourself for is that than you


---------59:47----------
really shouldn't because it's really not


---------59:49----------
anyone's fault but that doesn't mean


---------59:52----------
that you aren't responsible it doesn't
