---------00:00----------
and all you have to do is avoid going


---------00:02----------
into youtube by tolerating boredom


---------00:04----------
and if you can avoid opening up


---------00:06----------
something on your computer loading up a


---------00:07----------
game like loading up whatever reddit


---------00:09----------
like whatever


---------00:10----------
right i use those because that's what i


---------00:12----------
get distracted with if you can just


---------00:14----------
learn to sit


---------00:15----------
with that boredom your mind will


---------00:17----------
naturally coalesce back into study


---------00:20----------
so there's a particular skill which if


---------00:22----------
you can


---------00:24----------
learn then you will be far far more


---------00:27----------
productive


---------00:28----------
and that skill is the ability to


---------00:29----------
tolerate boredom i know it sounds kind


---------00:31----------
of weird


---------00:32----------
but i want you guys to think a little


---------00:34----------
bit about the process of how you get


---------00:36----------
distracted


---------00:37----------
and where your days go okay so


---------00:40----------
this is where um so i want you guys to


---------00:43----------
think about


---------00:44----------
what's going on when you try to work


---------00:45----------
okay so like here's you


---------00:49----------
and then like here's the book oh god i


---------00:51----------
can't write a book


---------00:52----------
i can't draw a book this is a book okay


---------00:55----------
you're so you're trying to read a book


---------00:57----------
so you're looking at the book all right


---------01:00----------
and so generally speaking what happens


---------01:01----------
is your mind tends to be like


---------01:04----------
one pointed right so this is going to be


---------01:06----------
like a one pointed mind


---------01:07----------
and you're looking at the book for a few


---------01:08----------
seconds like let's say a minute or two


---------01:10----------
you're like reading the book


---------01:11----------
and then something interesting happens


---------01:12----------
your mind goes from this to like a


---------01:14----------
scatter


---------01:16----------
okay so this is one point in mind


---------01:21----------
and this is a scattered mind all right


---------01:26----------
so like you guys know what i mean like


---------01:27----------
you're


---------01:27----------
because you're like i'm reading the book


---------01:28----------
and then your mind is like oh


---------01:31----------
like let's think about random crap and


---------01:34----------
so then when your mind becomes scattered


---------01:36----------
then then what it


---------01:37----------
starts to do is it starts to go in like


---------01:38----------
all these different directions right


---------01:40----------
so it's going over here it's going over


---------01:41----------
here it's going over here and and then


---------01:43----------
what used to happen


---------01:45----------
is that over time you'd like your mind


---------01:47----------
would wander like five minutes would


---------01:48----------
pass you'd be sitting at a library


---------01:50----------
and then the mind eventually like


---------01:51----------
coalesces back into a one-pointed mind


---------01:54----------
and then you're focused on the book


---------01:55----------
again


---------01:58----------
and if we think about the process of


---------02:00----------
studying what it is is like it's like


---------02:01----------
focus mind and then it scatters again


---------02:05----------
and then it goes back to focused and


---------02:08----------
then it scatters again


---------02:09----------
and on good days you know your focused


---------02:13----------
mind is


---------02:14----------
is longer and then the scattering is


---------02:17----------
shorter


---------02:21----------
right so like generally speaking as you


---------02:22----------
study this is the pattern of mind


---------02:24----------
does that make sense so your mind kind


---------02:26----------
of coalesces and then it's like one


---------02:28----------
pointed again


---------02:30----------
and then you know there are some things


---------02:31----------
that can help this like you know


---------02:33----------
caffeine helps this process


---------02:35----------
usually unless you have too much you


---------02:37----------
know so like stimulant medication from


---------02:39----------
adhd helps this process


---------02:42----------
um and so there


---------02:46----------
are all kinds of things that can kind of


---------02:48----------
cause you to coalesce your mind


---------02:50----------
so we also taught um so another uh


---------02:52----------
important


---------02:53----------
part of this process is something called


---------02:55----------
dharana


---------02:56----------
and pratyahara so we've talked a little


---------02:59----------
bit about these


---------03:01----------
but that's not going to be our focus


---------03:02----------
today these we can sort of explore a


---------03:04----------
little bit later okay so dharuna's focus


---------03:07----------
so these are like meditation techniques


---------03:08----------
that train your mind to become one


---------03:10----------
pointed


---------03:11----------
pratyahara is sensory withdrawal so


---------03:14----------
these are practices


---------03:16----------
that um essentially cause you to


---------03:20----------
restrain the senses


---------03:21----------
so let's like think about this for a


---------03:22----------
second what are the things that shatter


---------03:25----------
um a one-pointed mind so like let's say


---------03:28----------
i'm studying the library


---------03:29----------
and then someone brings in like a plate


---------03:31----------
of barbecue


---------03:32----------
right so then like i smell the barbecue


---------03:34----------
and then my mind shatters


---------03:37----------
okay let's say that


---------03:40----------
i'm uh studying and um


---------03:45----------
you know like i hear a ping on my phone


---------03:47----------
someone just texted me


---------03:48----------
so bbq you know sound from phone


---------03:52----------
notification right so


---------03:56----------
and then what this does is shatters my


---------03:57----------
focus so the reason is because


---------04:00----------
my focus gets shattered by the indriyas


---------04:02----------
or the sense organs


---------04:03----------
so pratyahara is the practice of


---------04:06----------
restraining your sense organs so like


---------04:07----------
keeping your eyes focused on


---------04:10----------
what they should be focused on getting


---------04:12----------
your nose under control getting your


---------04:14----------
ears under control like basically


---------04:15----------
restraining your attention where you


---------04:17----------
want it


---------04:18----------
okay that's not the focus today so all


---------04:21----------
of these


---------04:21----------
are about moving from here


---------04:25----------
to here okay but what i'm gonna what


---------04:29----------
we're gonna focus on today is not moving


---------04:30----------
from here to here we're gonna focus on


---------04:32----------
this


---------04:32----------
phase right here because this is where a


---------04:34----------
lot of people kind of mess up


---------04:37----------
so let's think about what happens when


---------04:39----------
your mind is scattered


---------04:41----------
okay so the mind enjoys being focused


---------04:43----------
and the mind enjoys being entertained


---------04:46----------
so mind enjoys focus


---------04:51----------
right and if we think about mind


---------04:53----------
enjoying entertainment what is


---------04:56----------
entertainment


---------04:59----------
entertainment is simply a sensory


---------05:02----------
experience that


---------05:03----------
sort of makes it very easy for your mind


---------05:06----------
to be focused


---------05:07----------
so if i play a video game like like the


---------05:09----------
whole point of like playing dota is that


---------05:11----------
dota cos


---------05:12----------
causes my mind to coalesce into this


---------05:15----------
right video games do this so if we


---------05:19----------
really think about it what we see is


---------05:20----------
that our mind actually really enjoys


---------05:22----------
being focused like the common element


---------05:24----------
is that the mind appreciates focus and


---------05:26----------
then even when we


---------05:27----------
when we think about studying like i


---------05:28----------
don't know if you guys have had this


---------05:29----------
experience but like sometimes studying


---------05:30----------
can be fun like you're kind of in a


---------05:31----------
groove and you're like learning stuff


---------05:33----------
you know in your mind is kind of focused


---------05:35----------
it really enjoys that


---------05:36----------
so where does the problem rise like why


---------05:38----------
is studying so hard


---------05:40----------
studying is so hard because our mind


---------05:42----------
gets distracted right


---------05:44----------
and so it shatters into this again


---------05:48----------
and in this moment we're bored


---------05:52----------
because you like like i don't want to


---------05:53----------
study like your mind is like oh let's


---------05:55----------
look at the book let's look at the book


---------05:57----------
and then you're


---------05:58----------
like there's another part of your mind


---------05:59----------
that's like no i don't want to do that


---------06:01----------
and this is where i think that studying


---------06:03----------
has gotten so much harder for people


---------06:04----------
like we hear this so much more now


---------06:06----------
that you know video games are addictive


---------06:08----------
i'm addicted to youtube like i spend


---------06:10----------
hours watching youtube i have no


---------06:11----------
motivation etc


---------06:13----------
because now actually something existed


---------06:15----------
that didn't exist 30 years ago which is


---------06:17----------
algorithmic entertainment


---------06:22----------
so what used to be so like let's think


---------06:24----------
about like you know


---------06:25----------
like in the 1950s if i'm at the library


---------06:29----------
and i get distracted


---------06:30----------
what would my mind do i pull out my


---------06:32----------
comic book


---------06:35----------
and i read my comic book for like 10


---------06:37----------
minutes okay


---------06:39----------
and then eventually my mind kind of


---------06:42----------
scatters again and then i focus back on


---------06:43----------
studying


---------06:44----------
but now we have something that's like


---------06:46----------
way more devastating which is that when


---------06:48----------
we enter these board states


---------06:50----------
we log on to youtube we get on reddit


---------06:53----------
you know like we get on these things we


---------06:55----------
get on like let's say


---------06:57----------
you know instagram whatever twitter


---------07:02----------
and the problem is that these things are


---------07:04----------
not gonna


---------07:05----------
like occupy your attention so the comic


---------07:07----------
book occupies your attention let's say


---------07:09----------
for


---------07:10----------
20 minutes the problem is that the


---------07:13----------
second you open these up you're gone for


---------07:15----------
three hours


---------07:17----------
right because with algorithmic


---------07:18----------
entertainment what happens is like


---------07:20----------
youtube is going to suggest things to


---------07:22----------
you that will keep your mind like


---------07:25----------
focused in that direction


---------07:27----------
reddit is like this is the crazy thing i


---------07:29----------
know this sounds weird but


---------07:30----------
i want you guys to really think about


---------07:31----------
this for a second you are tailoring


---------07:34----------
these websites to pull your attention


---------07:36----------
towards them right


---------07:37----------
you're giving them like a cheat code to


---------07:39----------
keep your attention occupied


---------07:41----------
so when you log on to reddit and like i


---------07:43----------
have all of my favorite subreddits that


---------07:45----------
i'm subscribed to


---------07:46----------
over time i'm making the website more


---------07:49----------
addictive to me


---------07:51----------
youtube this isn't just youtube's fault


---------07:54----------
it is like


---------07:54----------
also like your fault because as you


---------07:56----------
subscribe to more content


---------07:58----------
it's going to be like more entertaining


---------07:59----------
right as you watch youtube videos like


---------08:01----------
youtube's job is to make you


---------08:03----------
like enjoy like have a good experience


---------08:06----------
on youtube like you're not going to


---------08:07----------
like if you open up youtube and like


---------08:09----------
it's a bunch of nanny vlogs


---------08:11----------
and you're not interested in that it's


---------08:13----------
like that's a failure of a website right


---------08:15----------
so that's they're doing what they're


---------08:16----------
supposed to do


---------08:17----------
and it just has this really bizarre


---------08:18----------
consequence which is that you're


---------08:20----------
training youtube


---------08:22----------
to be more predatory towards your


---------08:24----------
attention


---------08:25----------
you're making it more addictive by


---------08:27----------
subscribing to [ __ ]


---------08:28----------
and if you subscribe to a bunch of


---------08:30----------
subreddits that you don't like or watch


---------08:31----------
a bunch of youtube videos and they get


---------08:32----------
all this crap that you don't care about


---------08:34----------
posted on your youtube then you're not


---------08:36----------
going to use the website right


---------08:38----------
so this is like the really tricky thing


---------08:40----------
is that when we become bored for a


---------08:41----------
second this is the real loss


---------08:43----------
and we get distracted and there's


---------08:44----------
algorithmic entertainment


---------08:46----------
boredom plus algorithmic entertainment


---------08:48----------
means three hours of your life gone and


---------08:49----------
no productivity


---------08:52----------
gg go next right


---------08:56----------
get rekt so the question then becomes


---------09:01----------
without oh wrong one oh


---------09:06----------
um


---------09:09----------
the question then becomes like what do


---------09:10----------
we do about this right so like once we


---------09:12----------
slip down this road


---------09:14----------
we're gone the three hours is the price


---------09:15----------
that you pay


---------09:17----------
because reddit is designed youtube is


---------09:19----------
designed to restrain your attention so


---------09:21----------
what they're gonna do is


---------09:22----------
they're gonna take your attention away


---------09:23----------
from studying


---------09:25----------
okay because that's what they're gonna


---------09:27----------
do so then the question becomes


---------09:29----------
like and then people ask like you know


---------09:31----------
oh how do i stop watching youtube


---------09:34----------
like you can't it's going to be really


---------09:35----------
hard like once your attention is over


---------09:37----------
here


---------09:37----------
to like pull your attention back towards


---------09:39----------
studying


---------09:40----------
this is going to require a lot of effort


---------09:43----------
and so then what happens is we look at


---------09:45----------
people and we say oh my god this person


---------09:46----------
is so disciplined


---------09:47----------
because some people can watch youtube


---------09:49----------
for like 10 minutes and then they go


---------09:51----------
back to


---------09:52----------
studying okay so this is study


---------09:56----------
and so then we say this person is


---------09:58----------
disciplined


---------10:00----------
good night what's and then we say i'm


---------10:04----------
not disciplined


---------10:05----------
i'm lazy so this is where the lazy


---------10:08----------
person goes


---------10:09----------
so question is okay what do you do so


---------10:11----------
last week we talked about


---------10:12----------
building conscientiousness okay so how


---------10:15----------
to become


---------10:16----------
how to move from lazy to being


---------10:18----------
disciplined but there's a real


---------10:19----------
real important secret here which is


---------10:22----------
right here


---------10:24----------
because if you can avoid this step


---------10:28----------
right here then you don't need to be


---------10:30----------
disciplined


---------10:32----------
you guys get this and so then the


---------10:34----------
question


---------10:35----------
if you can avoid opening up youtube


---------10:38----------
because once you go


---------10:39----------
once youtube is open it's designed they


---------10:41----------
pay like people millions of dollars


---------10:43----------
like reddit whatever all of these


---------10:46----------
companies right


---------10:47----------
um they pay these like they pay millions


---------10:50----------
of dollars to different engineers to


---------10:52----------
like make the website more usable by the


---------10:54----------
users


---------10:55----------
like creating a good user experience i


---------10:56----------
don't think that they're like being


---------10:58----------
you know evil about it that's just like


---------11:00----------
they're like hey we want to make a


---------11:01----------
website better


---------11:03----------
and so the key thing is that once you go


---------11:06----------
over here you're


---------11:07----------
you're screwed finished so how do you


---------11:10----------
avoid this step


---------11:11----------
and then the answer is to learn to


---------11:13----------
tolerate boredom


---------11:19----------
okay so what you guys need is patience


---------11:24----------
if you're lazy if you're good at sitting


---------11:27----------
around and not doing anything


---------11:28----------
that's totally fine we're just gonna


---------11:30----------
double down on that and let's see what


---------11:32----------
happens when you do that okay


---------11:34----------
so i'm studying


---------11:38----------
then my mind fractures


---------11:41----------
okay so what happens if i just sit with


---------11:45----------
it


---------11:46----------
right you're gonna have all these


---------11:47----------
thoughts and impulses you're gonna be


---------11:49----------
thinking about


---------11:51----------
barbecue then you're gonna be thinking


---------11:54----------
about gaming


---------11:56----------
you're going to be thinking about


---------12:00----------
laundry you're going to be thinking


---------12:02----------
about how this guy


---------12:04----------
is such a noob and your mind is kind of


---------12:07----------
wandering


---------12:07----------
and then eventually your mind will sort


---------12:10----------
of start to coalesce


---------12:12----------
okay it's going to go into this and then


---------12:15----------
eventually


---------12:16----------
it's going to go into this and then


---------12:19----------
eventually


---------12:19----------
it'll go right back here to study


---------12:24----------
so this is what you guys need to do you


---------12:27----------
have to understand that your mind


---------12:29----------
is like a burden flight right so it like


---------12:31----------
jumps up starts flying all over the


---------12:33----------
place


---------12:34----------
and all you have to do is avoid going


---------12:36----------
into youtube by tolerating boredom


---------12:38----------
and if you can avoid opening up


---------12:40----------
something on your computer loading up a


---------12:41----------
game like loading up whatever reddit


---------12:43----------
like whatever


---------12:44----------
right i i use those because that's what


---------12:46----------
i get distracted with if you can just


---------12:48----------
learn to sit


---------12:49----------
with that boredom your mind will


---------12:51----------
naturally coalesce back into study


---------12:54----------
it'll happen like sort of effortlessly


---------12:56----------
all you have to do is learn how to


---------12:58----------
tolerate that boredom in the middle


---------13:00----------
and if you think about what's happened


---------13:02----------
in our society okay so this is kind of


---------13:04----------
interesting


---------13:04----------
if you think about what's happened to


---------13:06----------
our brains how has technology affected


---------13:08----------
our brains


---------13:08----------
what technology has done is make us


---------13:12----------
like weak at tolerating boredom


---------13:15----------
okay so what it's almost like we're


---------13:17----------
running around with like electric


---------13:19----------
wheelchairs for our


---------13:20----------
mind and then like if you run if you


---------13:21----------
stop walking and you start using an


---------13:23----------
electric wheelchair you're going to


---------13:24----------
decondition


---------13:25----------
your body to with for physical activity


---------13:28----------
and walking right


---------13:29----------
so what have we done our our technology


---------13:31----------
has deconditioned our mind


---------13:33----------
to tolerate boredom and just think about


---------13:36----------
this for a second right like so when


---------13:37----------
you're in the car it's like podcast time


---------13:39----------
baby


---------13:40----------
when i'm cooking it's podcast time i'm


---------13:42----------
gonna be i'm gonna be productive


---------13:44----------
this is the danger right so you'll see


---------13:46----------
these websites where people will talk


---------13:48----------
about yeah i read a bunch of books


---------13:49----------
and i like listen to a bunch of audio


---------13:51----------
books and podcasts and stuff like that


---------13:53----------
i have entertainment time and then like


---------13:55----------
you know we're always doing something


---------13:57----------
our attention is


---------13:58----------
always on something and we get bored


---------14:02----------
very very easily and so like you know


---------14:04----------
having everything at your fingertips on


---------14:06----------
your phone is like terrible


---------14:08----------
for your ability to tolerate boredom


---------14:11----------
and so what's happened is we've become


---------14:13----------
unable to handle boredom


---------14:14----------
and as our mind gets weak at handling


---------14:17----------
boredom we like lose productivity


---------14:19----------
because then we get lost in these like


---------14:20----------
apps and stuff


---------14:22----------
and so everyone who's talking about


---------14:23----------
productivity you guys got to understand


---------14:24----------
that


---------14:25----------
productivity starts with the ability to


---------14:27----------
tolerate boredom


---------14:28----------
just that just learn how to be bored


---------14:32----------
if you can learn how to be bored then


---------14:34----------
your productivity will go through the


---------14:36----------
roof


---------14:36----------
because then in those key moments where


---------14:39----------
you are


---------14:39----------
bored and you reach for that thing that


---------14:42----------
it used to be a five-minute distraction


---------14:44----------
it used to be a 15-minute distraction it


---------14:46----------
used to be a 20-minute distraction


---------14:48----------
now it's a three-hour time commitment


---------14:51----------
and once you like step into the ring


---------14:52----------
with like you know


---------14:54----------
this this algorithm that's designed to


---------14:56----------
restrain your attention for three or


---------14:57----------
four


---------14:58----------
hours you are like way outmatched it's


---------15:00----------
just your little brain


---------15:02----------
against hundreds of millions of dollars


---------15:04----------
worth of like


---------15:05----------
engineering that is designed to prey on


---------15:08----------
your neuroscience


---------15:10----------
you guys are outmatched you can't win


---------15:11----------
then so the key


---------15:13----------
is to not step into the ring the way


---------15:15----------
that you not you don't step into the


---------15:16----------
ring


---------15:17----------
is to tolerate border right so like


---------15:20----------
what does that mean how do i learn


---------15:23----------
to tolerate boredom so we had a great


---------15:26----------
exercise that one of our coaching


---------15:27----------
clients came up and came up with


---------15:29----------
fantastic and very difficult is to sit


---------15:32----------
and stare at a wall


---------15:34----------
for an hour with no distractions


---------15:38----------
and it is devastatingly difficult but


---------15:41----------
really cool stuff will happen


---------15:43----------
very very cool stuff will happen if you


---------15:45----------
guys just sit at a wall


---------15:47----------
for an hour i know everyone's like


---------15:50----------
oh my god one hour of


---------15:54----------
not doing anything oh my god an entire


---------15:57----------
hour of doing nothing how am i gonna


---------15:59----------
tolerate that


---------16:02----------
right so don't even meditate uh-uh


---------16:05----------
meditation is doing something


---------16:07----------
not allowed to meditate just sit in an


---------16:09----------
hour and sit with yourself


---------16:12----------
and then your mind is going to do all


---------16:13----------
kinds of stuff it's going to be like


---------16:14----------
absolutely crazy for about 20 or 25


---------16:16----------
minutes


---------16:17----------
and then it's going to be like really


---------16:19----------
awesome like the second half if you guys


---------16:21----------
can make it


---------16:23----------
like is gonna be amazing because your


---------16:24----------
mind is gonna like come up with stuff


---------16:26----------
and it's gonna be like weird and


---------16:27----------
entertaining


---------16:29----------
sometimes what'll happen is like


---------16:33----------
a lot of negativity will come up you'll


---------16:34----------
start to like realize how bad of a


---------16:36----------
person you are and like how much of a


---------16:38----------
failure you are and stuff like that and


---------16:40----------
everyone's like how do i learn


---------16:41----------
acceptance like how do i learn to sit


---------16:42----------
with it that's the way that you learn


---------16:43----------
how to sit with it


---------16:46----------
right just sit and look at a wall


---------16:50----------
for an hour just do nothing and then if


---------16:53----------
you guys want to you guys can do easy


---------16:54----------
mode


---------16:57----------
in easy mode of sitting at the wall is


---------17:00----------
going for a walk


---------17:02----------
for also one hour


---------17:05----------
right so get up and go outside it'll


---------17:07----------
it'll like feel great like you'll still


---------17:08----------
be bored


---------17:09----------
you're going to want to put your


---------17:10----------
headphones in i want to listen to an


---------17:11----------
audiobook i want to listen to a podcast


---------17:13----------
i want to listen to this


---------17:14----------
i want to do this and like just think


---------17:15----------
about how much you know there was a time


---------17:18----------
where like okay so i wake up in the


---------17:19----------
morning i'd do yoga i'd study


---------17:21----------
i'd turn on the audio book while i was


---------17:23----------
showering i'd list be listening while i


---------17:25----------
was eating


---------17:26----------
i would you know as soon as i turn it


---------17:28----------
off like on the computer i pop in my


---------17:30----------
headphones walking to the subway


---------17:32----------
on the subway pull out the kindle put


---------17:35----------
away the kindle back to the audiobook to


---------17:37----------
the lecture hall listening to the


---------17:38----------
lecture


---------17:39----------
trying to listen to the lecture because


---------17:40----------
it's boring which is really hard because


---------17:42----------
i've


---------17:43----------
i've really not trained my attention


---------17:45----------
well


---------17:47----------
and then it's like back to the audiobook


---------17:48----------
a little bit of stuff on the computer


---------17:50----------
screen phone you know it's like


---------17:53----------
our our minds are constantly


---------17:57----------
externalized towards something we rely


---------18:00----------
on external technological crush


---------18:02----------
crutches to keep our minds focused on


---------18:05----------
one thing


---------18:05----------
and in doing so we have lost the


---------18:07----------
capacity


---------18:08----------
to focus our mind where we want it to we


---------18:11----------
become


---------18:12----------
victims to the screen right because like


---------18:14----------
if my the only way i can keep my


---------18:16----------
attention on something is if it is


---------18:17----------
entertaining enough


---------18:19----------
and then what we do is we call ourselves


---------18:20----------
lazy because we can't get anything done


---------18:24----------
so where does like where's the lynch pin


---------18:26----------
to all of this stuff


---------18:29----------
it is learning to tolerate por


---------18:32----------
so if you can tolerate boredom


---------18:36----------
then your mind will listen to you


---------18:38----------
because what boredom


---------18:39----------
is is the biggest rebellion of mind


---------18:43----------
you guys realize like how much you


---------18:45----------
detest how hard it is to like


---------18:47----------
be bored it's like imagine so i have a


---------18:50----------
great idea for you guys okay so just


---------18:52----------
think about this for a second


---------18:54----------
so i know people aren't flying right now


---------18:55----------
because of covet but think about going


---------18:57----------
on an


---------18:57----------
international flight with nothing to do


---------19:00----------
no books


---------19:01----------
no electronic devices torture


---------19:05----------
absolute door george eight hours on a


---------19:07----------
plane with nothing to do


---------19:11----------
gg think about how much you'd


---------19:14----------
test that and what is it that you face


---------19:17----------
when you're on a flight with yourself


---------19:19----------
with nothing to do what


---------19:22----------
like what's so bad about that


---------19:26----------
literally what is so bad about that it


---------19:28----------
is that your mind has no attention


---------19:31----------
no nothing to focus its attention


---------19:34----------
it's just you you're just with yourself


---------19:37----------
and you're bored with your mind


---------19:39----------
so if you want to go the marathon route


---------19:41----------
like take an international flight i mean


---------19:42----------
don't do it now because of covet


---------19:44----------
obviously but like


---------19:45----------
you know think about that for a second


---------19:46----------
like think about how


---------19:48----------
how much of a victim you are and how


---------19:51----------
poorly you


---------19:52----------
are at tolerating your own company with


---------19:54----------
just you hanging out by yourself


---------19:57----------
it's so terrifying terrifying


---------20:00----------
absolutely terrifying so this is the


---------20:03----------
cool thing


---------20:04----------
is that all this stuff can be fixed


---------20:08----------
right all you have to do is learn to


---------20:10----------
tolerate boredom


---------20:12----------
so just kind of going back to that


---------20:18----------
okay so like oh can't scroll so it all


---------20:21----------
comes


---------20:21----------
back to this right here


---------20:26----------
and if you can learn how to sit still


---------20:29----------
with this then your mind will naturally


---------20:31----------
return to focus


---------20:33----------
right because eventually what will


---------20:34----------
happen is and if you guys are wondering


---------20:36----------
about how is that so natural


---------20:38----------
because your mind hates form right so at


---------20:40----------
some point your mind is eventually gonna


---------20:42----------
say


---------20:43----------
anything i've been sitting on this


---------20:45----------
flight for six hours with nothing to do


---------20:47----------
give me a chemistry textbook please


---------20:50----------
anything to stop having nothing


---------20:55----------
chemistry physics whatever i'll take


---------20:57----------
anything anything master please


---------21:00----------
don't don't make me do this anymore


---------21:04----------
i give up i'll do whatever you want i'll


---------21:06----------
even study for my test


---------21:10----------
please right


---------21:14----------
because normally you are the slave


---------21:18----------
and the mind is the master and the goal


---------21:20----------
of what we do here


---------21:22----------
is training you to be in charge of the


---------21:24----------
mind


---------21:26----------
so i'll leave you guys with one analogy


---------21:29----------
so in the bhagavad-gita which is sort of


---------21:31----------
a text on hinduism but


---------21:33----------
or i mean it's people kind of in hindu


---------21:36----------
religion


---------21:37----------
sort of say it's a religious text


---------21:38----------
whatever there's a lot of good stuff


---------21:40----------
in in religious texts and especially in


---------21:43----------
gita


---------21:44----------
and there's this guy arjun and his


---------21:47----------
charioteer is this guy named krishna and


---------21:49----------
krishna says that


---------21:50----------
arjuna your mind is like a chariot with


---------21:53----------
like


---------21:53----------
five horses being like pulling it


---------21:57----------
your life is going to be successful if


---------22:00----------
you are in control of the horses


---------22:02----------
and if the horses are like doing


---------22:04----------
whatever they want to your life is going


---------22:06----------
to be a mess


---------22:07----------
and the horses are essentially your mind


---------22:08----------
really they're your injuries or your


---------22:10----------
sense organs


---------22:11----------
but it's like who's controlling like are


---------22:13----------
the horses is your mind controlling you


---------22:15----------
are you controlling your mind


---------22:17----------
and what you guys really need to do like


---------22:19----------
if you want to like be productive and


---------22:20----------
you want to be successful in all that


---------22:22----------
good stuff


---------22:23----------
is to have your mind do what you tell it


---------22:25----------
to do like if you wake up in the morning


---------22:27----------
and you're like


---------22:28----------
[ __ ] we're gonna study today and your


---------22:29----------
mind is like okay


---------22:32----------
whatever you say but otherwise it's the


---------22:34----------
other way around it's like your mind is


---------22:36----------
like one of these


---------22:36----------
kids who's like a complete spoiled brat


---------22:39----------
and the kid is like ah


---------22:41----------
we were gonna do this today yeah i don't


---------22:43----------
want to study [ __ ] you


---------22:45----------
i'm gonna play lol all day what are you


---------22:46----------
gonna do about it mom [ __ ] you


---------22:52----------
gg


---------22:54----------
right so learn to be bored and then you


---------22:57----------
will be successful
