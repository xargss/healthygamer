---------00:00----------
and then what happens when you go


---------00:01----------
looking for a big solution


---------00:03----------
you never find it right there you are


---------00:05----------
looking for the magic bullet that's


---------00:07----------
going to transform your


---------00:08----------
your mind and then you'll be a


---------00:10----------
disciplined person and you will be like


---------00:11----------
one of those people


---------00:12----------
it'll be a personality transformation so


---------00:15----------
this is why people stay stuck


---------00:17----------
so you have to experiment not all big


---------00:20----------
problems require big solutions


---------00:22----------
i've noticed that there are a lot of


---------00:23----------
people in this community who have sort


---------00:24----------
of these cycles


---------00:26----------
of like boom and bust when it comes to


---------00:28----------
motivation


---------00:29----------
so there's a lot of people myself


---------00:30----------
included who like you know you'll wake


---------00:32----------
up one day and something weird will


---------00:33----------
happen and you'll be like highly


---------00:35----------
motivated


---------00:36----------
and then you try to you know you work


---------00:38----------
really hard and then there's like this


---------00:39----------
thought in the back of your mind like oh


---------00:40----------
my god like when is this gonna end i


---------00:42----------
know it's gonna end and then you're like


---------00:44----------
motivated for a week and then like


---------00:46----------
it falls apart and then you're kind of


---------00:48----------
like you let things kind of


---------00:50----------
fail and you don't follow up with stuff


---------00:52----------
and things like that


---------00:53----------
and then you're kind of like you got a


---------00:54----------
week or two of like you're in a gray


---------00:56----------
zone where you're like you know not


---------00:57----------
really


---------00:58----------
feeling it and then you feel ashamed of


---------01:00----------
yourself and all this kind of stuff and


---------01:01----------
then eventually like you wake up and


---------01:02----------
your motivation comes back


---------01:04----------
and then like you know then you you kind


---------01:06----------
of go back to it so there's almost this


---------01:08----------
cycle


---------01:09----------
of success in failure and if we want to


---------01:11----------
understand the cycle of success and


---------01:13----------
failure we have to take a slightly


---------01:15----------
different perspective on emotion


---------01:16----------
on motivation that i think actually


---------01:18----------
western science


---------01:20----------
is sort of missing out a little bit on


---------01:23----------
and not to say that it you know misses


---------01:24----------
out on it entirely but if we kind of


---------01:26----------
look at western perspectives on


---------01:28----------
motivation


---------01:28----------
right so for example we have a very


---------01:30----------
strongly supported model of personality


---------01:33----------
called the five factor model and the


---------01:35----------
five factor model has


---------01:36----------
this attribute called conscientiousness


---------01:39----------
and what conscientiousness is


---------01:40----------
essentially like your ability to like


---------01:42----------
complete tasks over a period of time


---------01:45----------
so if you look at median income and


---------01:47----------
worldly success


---------01:48----------
it's correlated with high


---------01:49----------
conscientiousness so the people who have


---------01:52----------
a personality trait


---------01:54----------
of high conscientiousness or people that


---------01:56----------
we call


---------01:57----------
like disciplined right and those are the


---------01:59----------
people that like are lucky


---------02:00----------
because their personality is more


---------02:03----------
oriented towards being conscientious and


---------02:06----------
disciplined and organized


---------02:07----------
and they're the ones who can wake up at


---------02:09----------
7 00 am every day and exercise before


---------02:11----------
they go to work and


---------02:12----------
they apply to promotions on time and


---------02:14----------
they like you know


---------02:15----------
keep their resumes up to date like


---------02:17----------
they're very consistent and


---------02:18----------
conscientious focused


---------02:20----------
and so so in the west we sort of think


---------02:22----------
about and we can even see it in our


---------02:24----------
language


---------02:25----------
so the way that our science is sort of


---------02:27----------
structured is to sort of look at


---------02:30----------
motivation or discipline or


---------02:33----------
conscientiousness is a trait


---------02:35----------
right it's an aspect of who you are it's


---------02:37----------
part of your personality


---------02:39----------
and while personality can certainly


---------02:40----------
change over time it's not like a


---------02:42----------
temporary thing


---------02:43----------
so the word trait refers to something


---------02:45----------
that is like kind of a permanent part of


---------02:47----------
you


---------02:48----------
and then they're also states so a state


---------02:51----------
is something that is inherently


---------02:53----------
fluctuating so for example states of


---------02:56----------
consciousness


---------02:57----------
there's like being conscious there's


---------02:58----------
being asleep there's


---------03:00----------
an uh like fever is another example of a


---------03:02----------
state right being sick


---------03:04----------
is a state it's not a trait it's not a


---------03:06----------
part of who you are


---------03:07----------
it's something that fluctuates within


---------03:09----------
you and when i


---------03:10----------
hear people talk about motivation


---------03:13----------
people i've sort of noticed that there's


---------03:15----------
a bias of talking about it like a trait


---------03:18----------
right so there's


---------03:20----------
two types of people there's lazy people


---------03:23----------
and they're disciplined people there are


---------03:25----------
unmotivated people


---------03:26----------
and they're motivated people so this is


---------03:28----------
sort of like trait like dialogue


---------03:30----------
and our science sort of supports this


---------03:33----------
kind of hypothesis or bias right where


---------03:35----------
we sort of like have five factor


---------03:38----------
analysis and we sort of like look at


---------03:39----------
that and we say okay like there is


---------03:40----------
actually like a conscientiousness trait


---------03:43----------
to your personality and it's kind of


---------03:44----------
inborn and it's relatively constant so


---------03:46----------
it sort of makes sense it's scientific


---------03:48----------
that you know people are disciplined and


---------03:49----------
people are lazy


---------03:51----------
but if you really look at it right if


---------03:52----------
you look at it very carefully what you


---------03:54----------
really discover in your own life is that


---------03:56----------
motivation is actually a temporary thing


---------03:59----------
by nature your motivation fluctuates


---------04:02----------
over time right so like just like we


---------04:04----------
said i mean the whole problem is that


---------04:05----------
our motivation fluctuates over time


---------04:08----------
and then we kind of get into a a problem


---------04:10----------
because you know if we acknowledge that


---------04:12----------
our motivation fluctuates over time


---------04:14----------
like that it's essentially a state right


---------04:15----------
so i'm highly motivated today


---------04:17----------
i'm not motivated tomorrow then


---------04:21----------
you know it's kind of tricky because


---------04:22----------
like if our if our solutions


---------04:24----------
are sort of trait based if they're


---------04:27----------
personality based and people sort of


---------04:29----------
try to figure out how can i become a


---------04:31----------
disciplined person


---------04:32----------
that's where our target is what we


---------04:34----------
really try to do is become


---------04:36----------
something that we're not so we want to


---------04:37----------
like flip a switch


---------04:39----------
that turns on our motivation like almost


---------04:41----------
permanently right i want to become a


---------04:43----------
motivated person


---------04:45----------
and that's what i sort of gear towards


---------04:47----------
that's what like


---------04:48----------
success gurus will sort of talk about


---------04:50----------
right like this is how you become a


---------04:51----------
motivated person


---------04:52----------
but it's all very trait-based thinking


---------04:54----------
it's kind of interesting because


---------04:56----------
you know in the east they sort of think


---------04:57----------
about motivation a little bit more like


---------04:59----------
a state


---------05:00----------
so this is also you know generalization


---------05:02----------
but if you look at yogi's for example


---------05:04----------
what they'll say is like you know the


---------05:05----------
nature of the mind


---------05:06----------
is that it fluctuates and that like


---------05:09----------
motivation will naturally fluctuate over


---------05:11----------
time


---------05:12----------
in fact the definition of yoga so


---------05:14----------
there's a sanskrit


---------05:15----------
you know line yoga cheetah


---------05:18----------
which means that yoga is the cessation


---------05:21----------
of fluctuations of the mind


---------05:23----------
that is literally the definition of yoga


---------05:26----------
and so what does that kind of mean like


---------05:27----------
so how how is it that yoga and


---------05:29----------
meditation and yogis are like they're


---------05:30----------
like pretty hardcore right like they


---------05:31----------
wake up at like


---------05:32----------
4 a.m every day and they like meditate


---------05:34----------
and do yoga and they're very careful


---------05:36----------
about their diet and things like that


---------05:38----------
and so it's kind of interesting because


---------05:39----------
like how does that you know


---------05:42----------
what they kind of focus on is not


---------05:44----------
becoming disciplined


---------05:45----------
what they focus on is controlling the


---------05:47----------
state of their mind


---------05:49----------
and acknowledge that by definition it's


---------05:51----------
actually


---------05:52----------
fluctuating okay so i want you all to


---------05:55----------
think about something


---------05:57----------
so let's kind of so what i'd like to


---------05:58----------
share with you all today is an


---------06:00----------
understanding of motivation


---------06:01----------
as a state instead of a trait so i want


---------06:04----------
you to think about something so if i


---------06:05----------
play video games every day let's say i


---------06:06----------
wake up every day and i spend all my all


---------06:08----------
my time watching twitch and video games


---------06:10----------
and youtube and netflix and whatnot okay


---------06:12----------
so when i look at that when i look at


---------06:14----------
myself i say to myself


---------06:16----------
i am unmotivated and that is why


---------06:20----------
i spend all my time playing video games


---------06:23----------
and netflix and whatever right


---------06:25----------
so i want you all to think about this


---------06:27----------
for a second is it because you are


---------06:28----------
unmotivated that you spend all your time


---------06:31----------
we waste your time right they say oh if


---------06:32----------
i was more motivated i wouldn't


---------06:35----------
like if i was motivated i would go out


---------06:37----------
and like get a job or exercise or


---------06:38----------
whatever if i was motivated


---------06:40----------
so you know if i was motivated then i


---------06:42----------
would spend all my time doing this stuff


---------06:44----------
but i want you guys to think what's the


---------06:46----------
chicken and what's the egg is the lack


---------06:48----------
of motivation what causes you to play


---------06:49----------
video games all day


---------06:51----------
or is it playing video video games all


---------06:54----------
day that causes the lack of motivation


---------06:57----------
and so there's a really simple


---------06:58----------
experiment for this right so like you


---------06:59----------
think about you know your motivational


---------07:01----------
level


---------07:03----------
let's say like you want to work on your


---------07:04----------
resume when you wake up first thing in


---------07:06----------
the morning on a scale of one to ten how


---------07:08----------
much do you


---------07:08----------
want to work on your resume let's call


---------07:10----------
it a four okay let's say like you're not


---------07:12----------
even work on it


---------07:12----------
but if you measure your motivational


---------07:14----------
level it's like a four out of ten


---------07:16----------
and then like after you play like an


---------07:19----------
hour of a game


---------07:20----------
what happens to your motivation are you


---------07:22----------
like more motivated or less motivated


---------07:24----------
to work on your resume and then like


---------07:27----------
after six hours of the game


---------07:28----------
and eight hours of a game like if you


---------07:31----------
pla been playing league for 10 hours


---------07:34----------
how motivated are you to


---------07:37----------
work on things right and so it's


---------07:40----------
interesting because


---------07:41----------
most people are saying less some people


---------07:42----------
are saying more so we'll get to that in


---------07:44----------
a second some people are saying the same


---------07:46----------
but i'm not saying that you know even


---------07:48----------
without doing the behavior


---------07:49----------
your motivation towards the behavior


---------07:51----------
will fluctuate i know it's kind of


---------07:52----------
interesting right but if you really pay


---------07:53----------
attention to yourself


---------07:55----------
we're not saying that if you say the


---------07:56----------
same because you're not doing it that's


---------07:58----------
not actually correct


---------07:59----------
your motivation actually fluctuates


---------08:00----------
which is a really fascinating discovery


---------08:02----------
because


---------08:03----------
then what we sort of realize is that


---------08:04----------
like playing video games


---------08:06----------
induces low motivation which is a really


---------08:10----------
shocking discovery because


---------08:11----------
that doesn't mean that you're lazy or


---------08:13----------
disciplined right it's not a trait


---------08:15----------
it's that the things that you do will


---------08:17----------
actively contribute or not contribute to


---------08:20----------
your motivation


---------08:22----------
so essentially what the yogis sort of


---------08:23----------
discovered is a system where


---------08:25----------
i would kind of think about it this way


---------08:27----------
there's certain actions so i want you to


---------08:28----------
think about motivation not as like a


---------08:30----------
personality characteristic


---------08:32----------
or like a stat on your character sheet


---------08:34----------
it's not like they're disciplined people


---------08:35----------
and undisciplined people


---------08:36----------
i want you to think about motivation as


---------08:38----------
a bank balance and there's some actions


---------08:41----------
that you take


---------08:42----------
which will contribute to the balance and


---------08:44----------
then when you want to do something


---------08:46----------
you will actually like pull from the


---------08:48----------
balance right i'm going to make deposits


---------08:50----------
and i'm going to make withdrawals


---------08:52----------
so if i i know it sounds kind of weird


---------08:54----------
going to the gym


---------08:55----------
requires a withdrawal right


---------08:59----------
but being at the gym actually makes a


---------09:02----------
deposit


---------09:03----------
which is interesting so now we begin to


---------09:04----------
see like how disciplined people are


---------09:07----------
able to do it because every time they go


---------09:09----------
to the gym they make a withdrawal but


---------09:11----------
they also make a deposit


---------09:13----------
and y'all you know it's kind of like


---------09:14----------
really fascinating because if you


---------09:16----------
notice yourselves and you know the cycle


---------09:18----------
of motivation what essentially happens


---------09:20----------
is like


---------09:21----------
you do something right and then you feel


---------09:23----------
motivated and like okay i clean my room


---------09:24----------
good


---------09:25----------
now i'm gonna do this and now i'm gonna


---------09:26----------
do this and now i'm gonna do this and


---------09:28----------
now i'm gonna do this


---------09:30----------
and if we spend all of our time playing


---------09:31----------
video games like what's happening to our


---------09:33----------
motivation like we're making withdrawals


---------09:35----------
from it right like if i'm


---------09:36----------
i'm decreasing my motivational capital


---------09:39----------
when i


---------09:39----------
waste my days and so it's kind of


---------09:42----------
interesting because then if we look at


---------09:43----------
the cycle of motivation inevitably what


---------09:45----------
we find


---------09:46----------
is as people become more motivated and


---------09:48----------
they start doing more stuff


---------09:50----------
they start engaging in actions which


---------09:52----------
require withdrawals but they're not


---------09:54----------
making the appropriate deposits i know


---------09:55----------
it sounds kind of weird


---------09:57----------
but if i start like you know if i clean


---------09:58----------
my room that requires an energy


---------10:00----------
investment and gives me a burst of


---------10:01----------
energy


---------10:02----------
and then eventually what i'll end up


---------10:03----------
doing is i'll take on like bigger tasks


---------10:05----------
more difficult tasks like more


---------10:07----------
challenging tasks


---------10:08----------
that actually withdraw more of my


---------10:11----------
motivational energy than i'm able to


---------10:13----------
deposit


---------10:13----------
so a good example of this is like


---------10:15----------
tackling finding a job


---------10:17----------
right because like that task is so big


---------10:20----------
that you don't really get the reward


---------10:22----------
until the end but there are all of these


---------10:25----------
steps involved which


---------10:26----------
you may actually be making motivational


---------10:28----------
withdrawals for


---------10:29----------
and then you kind of like run out of


---------10:31----------
motivation and i know it sounds like


---------10:32----------
really really weird but


---------10:33----------
if you look at people who who go into


---------10:35----------
cycles of success and failure


---------10:37----------
what they essentially do is like they


---------10:38----------
start off lighting the candle


---------10:40----------
and then they like light a firecracker


---------10:43----------
and then like they light like you know


---------10:46----------
they just like burn all their motivation


---------10:47----------
away and then it's like


---------10:48----------
a set of fireworks and then they feel


---------10:50----------
completely spent afterward


---------10:52----------
and what what i really find is that if


---------10:55----------
you really want to sustain your


---------10:56----------
motivation


---------10:58----------
you have to continually make deposits so


---------11:00----------
we see this in addictions too okay so


---------11:01----------
addictions is a


---------11:02----------
fantastic example of this where you know


---------11:05----------
someone is like


---------11:06----------
yeah like i'm i'm one week sober hell


---------11:08----------
yeah like how did you get one weeks over


---------11:10----------
i went to three meetings a week


---------11:12----------
and then they're like i'm sober it's


---------11:13----------
great i feel awesome i'm gonna start


---------11:14----------
doing this i'm gonna start doing this


---------11:16----------
because i'm sober now i'm sober now


---------11:18----------
and eventually what happens is like oh


---------11:20----------
like what about going to meetings


---------11:21----------
i don't need to go to meetings anymore


---------11:22----------
like i'm sober i don't need meetings


---------11:25----------
i've done it i'm three months sober so


---------11:27----------
they stopped going to meetings


---------11:29----------
right and at first they were like super


---------11:30----------
careful and they like went to their


---------11:32----------
first barbecue where people were


---------11:33----------
drinking and they were going to meetings


---------11:34----------
at the time they're like oh i can handle


---------11:36----------
this now.


---------11:37----------
so they stop going to meetings and they


---------11:38----------
continue going to barbecues


---------11:40----------
and then eventually what happens they


---------11:41----------
continue going to barbecues and then


---------11:42----------
they relapse


---------11:44----------
it's like how did that relapse happen i


---------11:46----------
thought you had it under control like i


---------11:47----------
thought


---------11:47----------
you had solved it and they're like yeah


---------11:49----------
now i am


---------11:51----------
sober it becomes a trait in their mind


---------11:54----------
instead of a state


---------11:55----------
it's no longer something that i have to


---------11:58----------
work towards i have it on luck


---------11:59----------
i am sober now i am disciplined i don't


---------12:01----------
need to worry about maintaining


---------12:03----------
discipline


---------12:03----------
because i am disciplined and so


---------12:06----------
essentially what we discover


---------12:08----------
is that there are contributing factors


---------12:10----------
to our motivation


---------12:12----------
which is it's a state right so you've


---------12:14----------
got these motivational bucks


---------12:16----------
and it's going to fluctuate over time


---------12:17----------
and instead of chasing


---------12:19----------
after becoming a disciplined person all


---------12:22----------
you really need to do is like keep on


---------12:23----------
making motivational deposits


---------12:25----------
in the case of sobriety what it means is


---------12:27----------
like you go to meetings


---------12:29----------
even if you're sober you keep going to


---------12:30----------
meetings


---------12:32----------
because i see this all the time you know


---------12:34----------
in mental health treatment especially


---------12:36----------
is that people love abandoning the


---------12:38----------
treatment that works


---------12:40----------
like if i put someone on an


---------12:41----------
antidepressant medication and six months


---------12:43----------
later they're no longer depressed


---------12:45----------
they come into my office and they're


---------12:46----------
like yeah i want to stop the medication


---------12:47----------
why because i'm not depressed anymore


---------12:50----------
it's a reasonable like request right but


---------12:52----------
like


---------12:53----------
let's understand how you got


---------12:56----------
there and so if you're experiencing


---------12:59----------
cycles


---------13:00----------
of success and failure what i really


---------13:02----------
want y'all to pay attention to


---------13:04----------
is what are what is like the state of


---------13:06----------
motivation


---------13:07----------
that what led to your state of


---------13:09----------
motivation


---------13:10----------
so like really think a little bit about


---------13:12----------
you know when people say like okay like


---------13:14----------
i shouldn't play video games i need to


---------13:15----------
stop playing video games entirely


---------13:17----------
whereas recognize that each hour of the


---------13:19----------
day that you play video games it


---------13:21----------
actually makes like a motivational


---------13:22----------
withdrawal


---------13:23----------
so and this is really dangerous thinking


---------13:25----------
because if i play like


---------13:26----------
let's say valorent for 10 hours a day or


---------13:28----------
dota for 10 hours a day


---------13:30----------
and i think to myself if i play for


---------13:33----------
eight hours a day


---------13:34----------
what difference does it make eight or


---------13:36----------
ten what's the difference i'm not gonna


---------13:38----------
you know i'm not gonna put together my


---------13:39----------
life if i'm playing dodo for eight hours


---------13:41----------
a day


---------13:41----------
who the hell cares about ten hours a day


---------13:43----------
like eight or ten what difference does


---------13:45----------
it have to degenerate either either way


---------13:47----------
and those are the people that don't


---------13:48----------
acknowledge that playing dota for two


---------13:50----------
less hours a day


---------13:51----------
is actually going to boost your


---------13:52----------
motivation by a small amount


---------13:55----------
so i want y'all to really focus on the


---------13:56----------
state of motivation


---------13:59----------
and you can also kind of understand this


---------14:01----------
with with


---------14:02----------
food as well right so like you can think


---------14:04----------
about


---------14:05----------
when you eat like how much do you feel


---------14:08----------
like studying how much do you feel like


---------14:09----------
working and like depending on what food


---------14:11----------
you put into your body


---------14:12----------
how does that affect your motivation if


---------14:14----------
i'm like you know if it noon rolls


---------14:16----------
around and i eat like six slices of


---------14:18----------
pepperoni pizza like what's gonna happen


---------14:19----------
to my motivation afterward


---------14:21----------
what happens to my motivation when i


---------14:23----------
drink coffee what happens to my


---------14:24----------
motivation when i take adderall


---------14:26----------
so we begin to see that once again and


---------14:28----------
this is why yogis have a very specific


---------14:30----------
diet because they sort of discovered


---------14:31----------
something called the satwik diet


---------14:33----------
you know what the satwik diet


---------14:34----------
essentially does is like enhances the


---------14:37----------
state of your mind


---------14:38----------
so that you're like highly motivated and


---------14:41----------
so it's kind of tricky because like


---------14:43----------
you know we think about discipline and


---------14:44----------
laziness but what we really don't think


---------14:46----------
about is like what is the cost of eating


---------14:48----------
six slices of pizza


---------14:49----------
it's not just calories and you're like


---------14:51----------
i'm a degenerate i don't care about


---------14:52----------
calories like whatever


---------14:53----------
like i'm overweight whatever or you're


---------14:55----------
not overweight maybe you've got avata


---------14:56----------
metabolism and you're totally fine


---------14:59----------
but what we don't really think about is


---------15:00----------
each action that you take


---------15:02----------
is going to be making a motivational


---------15:03----------
deposit or a motivational withdrawal


---------15:06----------
and what i encourage you all to do is to


---------15:07----------
really think about the state of


---------15:08----------
motivation


---------15:10----------
and think about how does my motivation


---------15:11----------
get altered and how do i need to


---------15:13----------
nurture it because it's not a trait


---------15:16----------
right it's not like a house that i build


---------15:18----------
and then stays up there


---------15:19----------
motivation needs to be cultivated like a


---------15:21----------
garden now i can water it every day and


---------15:24----------
it'll grow


---------15:24----------
and it'll be great but if i stop


---------15:26----------
watering it the garden's gonna die


---------15:29----------
so most people that i work with who have


---------15:31----------
cycles of success or failure


---------15:32----------
essentially once they start harvesting


---------15:35----------
fruit or vegetables or herbs or whatever


---------15:37----------
from the garden


---------15:38----------
they stop taking care of it which


---------15:39----------
inevitably leads to the failure


---------15:42----------
so start to think a little bit more


---------15:43----------
about motivation as a state and start to


---------15:45----------
think a little bit about how your diet


---------15:47----------
how your actions how your the company


---------15:49----------
that you keep how your environment


---------15:51----------
sort of gives you motivational deposits


---------15:54----------
and be really careful if you start to


---------15:56----------
withdraw a ton without


---------15:58----------
continuing to maintain whatever brought


---------16:00----------
you the motivation in the first place


---------16:02----------
how do i get enough protein with a


---------16:04----------
scotic diet it's tough but remember that


---------16:06----------
the saatvik diet you can eat tofu


---------16:08----------
and you can eat lentils right so those


---------16:11----------
are the two major sources of protein


---------16:13----------
but if you're going to be a bodybuilder


---------16:14----------
and you're trying to eat one


---------16:16----------
you know one gram of protein per kg i


---------16:19----------
think is what it is


---------16:20----------
you know that's really hard to do on the


---------16:22----------
scottish diet remember that scottish


---------16:24----------
people are not bodybuilders


---------16:29----------
what about discipline so here's what i'd


---------16:30----------
say about discipline


---------16:32----------
discipline is what a high state of


---------16:36----------
motivation


---------16:37----------
looks like from the outside so if you if


---------16:40----------
you actually look on


---------16:41----------
inside the mind of a disciplined person


---------16:44----------
they're not


---------16:44----------
disciplined like it's not very different


---------16:47----------
from your mind it's just i i know it


---------16:50----------
sounds kind of weird but


---------16:51----------
discipline is like what we see from the


---------16:53----------
outside it's an emergent property it's


---------16:54----------
not actually a thing


---------16:56----------
yeah so can you provide some practical


---------16:57----------
examples of depositing and withdrawing


---------16:59----------
stuff from your motivational bank


---------17:01----------
absolutely so like i've done i have


---------17:03----------
right so like playing a video game what


---------17:04----------
does that do to your motivational bank


---------17:06----------
decreases it or you're not making a


---------17:08----------
deposit right


---------17:09----------
so like if you think about doing a small


---------17:11----------
task like cleaning cleaning is going to


---------17:13----------
be a motivational deposit


---------17:15----------
and a motivational cost but generally


---------17:17----------
speaking it's going to be an


---------17:18----------
upswing so if we think about cleaning


---------17:20----------
this is the way i'd think about cleaning


---------17:22----------
so cleaning requires


---------17:26----------
withdraws five motivational points but


---------17:29----------
gives you a plus two


---------17:31----------
for the next week every single day


---------17:34----------
right so what we tend to see is that


---------17:36----------
people who are highly disciplined like


---------17:37----------
will do multiple things


---------17:39----------
going to the gym is a minus 10 but is a


---------17:41----------
plus four


---------17:43----------
for the next week eating a healthy meal


---------17:47----------
maybe like a minus two but will be a


---------17:51----------
plus one


---------17:52----------
for the like a plus three for the next


---------17:55----------
three days


---------17:57----------
right so this is how i want you guys to


---------17:59----------
think about your motivational bank


---------18:01----------
he's like what is the small task every


---------18:03----------
time i play a video game like if i play


---------18:05----------
one day of dota


---------18:07----------
that's a minus two for the next 72 hours


---------18:10----------
right and then eventually we get to like


---------18:11----------
dopamine detox realm where if you play


---------18:14----------
that


---------18:14----------
so much then it's like a pretty bad like


---------18:16----------
minus


---------18:17----------
30 or minus 50 percent to all


---------18:20----------
motivational deposits


---------18:22----------
it's a 50 tax on every deposit that you


---------18:25----------
make


---------18:27----------
so this is why if you look at people who


---------18:29----------
like you know put their lives together


---------18:31----------
they do so


---------18:32----------
not by transforming themselves


---------18:35----------
right and even like this is the problem


---------18:37----------
is if you look at like people who become


---------18:38----------
successful and i fall into this


---------18:40----------
camp right i say oh i went to india and


---------18:42----------
i found myself and then i became


---------18:44----------
successful


---------18:45----------
and it seems like a magical like


---------18:47----------
overnight thing


---------18:48----------
but i went to india at the age of 21 and


---------18:50----------
i started medical school at the age of


---------18:51----------
28.


---------18:52----------
there's seven years in there of like


---------18:55----------
little


---------18:56----------
successes and little failures that sort


---------18:58----------
of build up over time


---------19:00----------
so it took me seven years to get on the


---------19:02----------
path to success


---------19:04----------
let alone another like eight


---------19:07----------
to actually like become qualified to be


---------19:10----------
a decent human being


---------19:11----------
is a scottish diet gonna be vegan no so


---------19:13----------
sativic diets will include dairy


---------19:16----------
actually unless you take do you unless


---------19:18----------
you do like the east asian version of a


---------19:19----------
sophic diet


---------19:20----------
which may be dairy free those will


---------19:22----------
probably be vegan like if you eat at you


---------19:25----------
know a monastery in korea like that'll


---------19:27----------
probably be vegan


---------19:28----------
how does one overcome more difficult


---------19:30----------
obstacles to gain motivation


---------19:32----------
is it just do it no so this is my whole


---------19:34----------
point


---------19:35----------
so the way that you become overcome a


---------19:36----------
difficult obstacle is by making


---------19:38----------
tiny tiny deposits that are going to


---------19:40----------
build up your motivational bank


---------19:43----------
right so how do you overcome depression


---------19:45----------
like i've seen a bunch of these posts


---------19:46----------
recently where people like i cleaned my


---------19:48----------
kitchen today


---------19:49----------
does that overcome depression no is it a


---------19:52----------
step forward


---------19:53----------
absolutely so you clean your kitchen one


---------19:55----------
day you do your laundry day two


---------19:58----------
you like clean the living room day three


---------20:00----------
and you go through your mail


---------20:02----------
day four


---------20:05----------
you look at your syllabus day five and


---------20:07----------
each of those days


---------20:08----------
is going to give you like a motivation


---------20:10----------
buff that's like stacking


---------20:13----------
and then what happens is people stack it


---------20:14----------
stack and stack it and then they get to


---------20:16----------
the point they're like


---------20:17----------
oh look at all this motivation i have


---------20:19----------
now comes the cycle of success and


---------20:20----------
failure


---------20:21----------
because you've you've stacked up a buff


---------20:23----------
of plus 28 motivation


---------20:24----------
per day that starts decaying over time


---------20:27----------
and then you stop doing the things to


---------20:28----------
take care of yourself


---------20:29----------
and then it all disappears right so i


---------20:32----------
want you all to stop thinking about


---------20:33----------
discipline


---------20:34----------
or saying like oh i took a five-factor


---------20:36----------
personality test and


---------20:37----------
my conscientiousness is low i'm screwed


---------20:41----------
like that's scientifically that's true


---------20:45----------
and you can still overcome it right by


---------20:48----------
using motivation


---------20:49----------
buffs which is the eastern style so


---------20:52----------
if people want one really really simple


---------20:55----------
concrete


---------20:55----------
thing to do to make a motivational


---------20:57----------
deposit


---------20:59----------
one day a week okay like if you have


---------21:01----------
medical concerns or something like that


---------21:03----------
like make sure you talk to your doctor


---------21:04----------
but i'd say one day a week


---------21:06----------
do a fast that includes fruits nuts and


---------21:08----------
dairy and that's it


---------21:10----------
one day a week and water obviously so


---------21:13----------
like drink as much water as you want to


---------21:14----------
but


---------21:15----------
you know you can still get a decent


---------21:16----------
number of calories so we're not saying


---------21:17----------
like starve yourself but like reduce


---------21:19----------
what kind of macronutrients you take in


---------21:21----------
fruits nuts and dairy that's it yeah so


---------21:23----------
if you've got like diabetes and stuff


---------21:25----------
you know don't do this kind of thing but


---------21:27----------
how does this help it's going to give


---------21:29----------
you a motivational buff of like plus


---------21:30----------
three for the next few days


---------21:32----------
that's how it's gonna help no veggies


---------21:35----------
just give it a shot so i'm not saying


---------21:36----------
you should do it for a prolonged period


---------21:38----------
of time you try it for a day and see if


---------21:39----------
you like it


---------21:41----------
so a lot of people i encourage all of


---------21:43----------
you all to experiment with your diet


---------21:45----------
right try to figure out okay what are


---------21:46----------
the foods that make me feel more


---------21:48----------
motivated


---------21:48----------
what are the foods that make me feel


---------21:50----------
less motivated start to make adjustments


---------21:52----------
i think a good place to start is like


---------21:54----------
you know you'll get


---------21:55----------
some amount of protein some amount of


---------21:57----------
fat and some amount of carbohydrate


---------21:58----------
it's a relatively safe thing to do and


---------22:01----------
if it feels really bad or you start to


---------22:02----------
get concerned or whatever like if you


---------22:04----------
start to feel super weird like


---------22:05----------
just eat normally and you should be fine


---------22:07----------
or go see a doctor


---------22:09----------
maybe ask your doctor before you do it's


---------22:10----------
probably good advice and so i want y'all


---------22:13----------
to all pay attention to what's happening


---------22:14----------
right now


---------22:15----------
so in your life motivation is a big


---------22:18----------
problem


---------22:19----------
therefore it requires a big solution so


---------22:22----------
the other problem with cycles of


---------22:23----------
motivation and failure is that like


---------22:25----------
think see how your mind resists the


---------22:27----------
solution it's like oh that can't be


---------22:29----------
enough


---------22:30----------
because the problem feels so big to me


---------22:32----------
that it must have a big solution


---------22:35----------
and then what happens when you go


---------22:36----------
looking for a big solution


---------22:38----------
you never find it right there you are


---------22:40----------
looking for the magic bullet that's


---------22:41----------
going to transform your


---------22:43----------
your mind and then you'll be a


---------22:44----------
disciplined person and you will be like


---------22:46----------
one of those people


---------22:47----------
it'll be a personality transformation


---------22:50----------
this is why people stay stuck


---------22:51----------
so you have to experiment not all big


---------22:54----------
problems require big solutions like


---------22:56----------
someone has been addicted to alcohol for


---------22:58----------
15 years


---------23:01----------
how do i get sober it's such a huge


---------23:03----------
problem you go to meetings


---------23:04----------
you go see a therapist that's it it's


---------23:07----------
like four hours a week


---------23:10----------
three hours a week two hours a week


---------23:11----------
maybe even one hour a week


---------23:14----------
it's really interesting so be careful


---------23:16----------
when your mind


---------23:17----------
tells you that a solution is too simple


---------23:19----------
or too easy


---------23:21----------
for your hard and complex problem


---------23:24----------
and what you really listen i i encourage


---------23:26----------
you to think about it in your own life


---------23:28----------
right like when you've


---------23:29----------
realized something you're like oh crap


---------23:30----------
it's so simple i just didn't realize it


---------23:35----------
right so big solutions don't necessarily


---------23:37----------
require big problems


---------23:38----------
i mean uh big problems don't necessarily


---------23:41----------
require big solutions


---------23:42----------
is vitamin d deficiency messing with


---------23:44----------
motivation too absolutely


---------23:46----------
so there's uh you know one of the tests


---------23:48----------
that i always run


---------23:49----------
not always but usually run for patients


---------23:51----------
of mine who are depressed is vitamin d


---------23:54----------
so vitamin d deficiency contribute is


---------23:56----------
one of the


---------23:57----------
causes for depression and so we also


---------23:59----------
know that


---------24:00----------
you know supplementing vitamin d or


---------24:01----------
getting someone's vitamin d level back


---------24:03----------
to normal can be a treatment for


---------24:04----------
depression


---------24:05----------
so this is where in the east they sort


---------24:07----------
of say that there's seven


---------24:09----------
things that result in health and one of


---------24:12----------
them is sunlight


---------24:13----------
and that sunlight is like important to


---------24:15----------
be healthy


---------24:16----------
what are the others okay so let me see


---------24:18----------
if i can remember


---------24:19----------
sunlight food water air sleep


---------24:23----------
exercise and meditation


---------24:26----------
these are the seven things that you


---------24:27----------
should do to take care of yourself


---------24:39----------
you
