---------00:06----------
the third thing this is probably the


---------00:07----------
most important one which


---------00:08----------
i had said is that like you're gonna


---------00:10----------
notice when people are quiet


---------00:18----------
um so what do we what uh what do you go


---------00:20----------
by by the way do am i calling you hafu


---------00:22----------
or should i


---------00:23----------
go oh my god is great okay


---------00:26----------
and um what do you want to talk about


---------00:28----------
today


---------00:30----------
whatever i'm down to talk about whatever


---------00:32----------
okay that's pretty vague


---------00:34----------
how are you feeling


---------00:37----------
i am feeling okay today i'm feeling good


---------00:40----------
today is a good day some days i don't


---------00:43----------
feel as good


---------00:44----------
and it probably has to do with viewer


---------00:47----------
numbers


---------00:48----------
if i'm being candid okay and um


---------00:52----------
it feels like maybe i should be able to


---------00:54----------
do more


---------00:55----------
or maybe i should have been able to put


---------00:56----------
up better content or something


---------00:59----------
um and if i don't win any games i'm in a


---------01:01----------
really bad mood


---------01:04----------
so you and the rest of the internet


---------01:07----------
yeah so today you're feeling good and


---------01:09----------
you said in the past sometimes you feel


---------01:11----------
less


---------01:12----------
good um


---------01:16----------
so let me just ask you because i'm kind


---------01:18----------
of feeling a little bit different today


---------01:20----------
so um do you want to talk about like how


---------01:23----------
stuff works


---------01:24----------
or do you want to talk a little bit more


---------01:26----------
about like your emotions and your


---------01:28----------
experience of things


---------01:32----------
i think either i feel like i have a


---------01:34----------
pretty i mean i think everyone


---------01:36----------
can use therapy i'm not saying that i'm


---------01:38----------
too smart for therapy or anything like


---------01:40----------
that


---------01:40----------
but i feel like when i was younger i was


---------01:42----------
very unhappy i was definitely depressed


---------01:45----------
and it was kind of cool because


---------01:48----------
i was so like depressed and insecure


---------01:51----------
i put all my time and energy into wow as


---------01:53----------
an escape


---------01:55----------
and i actually become a pro wow player


---------01:57----------
and that gave me a lot of confidence


---------01:59----------
because it was


---------02:00----------
i got it yeah that's my fiance


---------02:03----------
he's also the streamer um but it gave me


---------02:06----------
a lot of confidence


---------02:08----------
and um i kind of used like game theory


---------02:11----------
to psychoanalyze myself and basically in


---------02:14----------
games


---------02:15----------
i would be like why am i losing i don't


---------02:17----------
know


---------02:18----------
uh that's not a good thing why don't i


---------02:20----------
know why i'm losing because i don't have


---------02:21----------
enough information about the game


---------02:23----------
i would like try to pinpoint the you


---------02:26----------
know exactly what i had to do against


---------02:27----------
every class


---------02:28----------
and um kind of learn from there


---------02:32----------
and so i kind of saw myself like what


---------02:34----------
what do i not like about myself


---------02:37----------
i didn't like anything about myself when


---------02:38----------
i was 17. let me tell you


---------02:40----------
and i was like very passive-aggressive


---------02:43----------
i'd kind of like lie all the time


---------02:45----------
um to just try to like make myself feel


---------02:47----------
better


---------02:48----------
i would talk poorly about others all the


---------02:50----------
time i didn't like how i looked


---------02:52----------
like everything and then i kind of went


---------02:54----------
down the line of


---------02:56----------
you know what can i fix and what do i


---------02:58----------
have to just kind of live with


---------03:00----------
and yeah now i'm i feel like now i'm 29


---------03:04----------
and um i kind of fix a lot of those


---------03:06----------
things


---------03:07----------
i think i over fix the passive


---------03:10----------
aggressive thing i'm too blunt


---------03:11----------
now i'm a little too blunt so that's


---------03:14----------
something i'm working on


---------03:16----------
um is to not be brutally honest and i


---------03:18----------
can phrase things in a better way


---------03:20----------
but other than that i feel like i'm


---------03:22----------
happy with who i am


---------03:25----------
okay so that was not what i was


---------03:28----------
expecting


---------03:29----------
oh um no i mean i


---------03:32----------
i find myself being incredibly curious


---------03:34----------
about


---------03:35----------
everything that you just summarized oh


---------03:38----------
like how so here's what i'm hearing this


---------03:42----------
is a 17 year old hafu


---------03:44----------
who lies a lot is passive aggressive


---------03:47----------
hates everything about herself


---------03:49----------
goes on this like journey of


---------03:50----------
introspection and then


---------03:52----------
is now largely happy with who she is as


---------03:54----------
a person


---------03:56----------
yeah which sounds like maybe we should


---------03:58----------
learn about that journey because maybe


---------04:00----------
there's something really really


---------04:01----------
important there


---------04:03----------
sure um and then also if there are


---------04:05----------
particular things that you still want to


---------04:07----------
kind of talk about or try to understand


---------04:10----------
uh you know we can talk about


---------04:11----------
29 year old hafu yeah then


---------04:13----------
congratulations on being engaged


---------04:16----------
thank you i still definitely have a chip


---------04:19----------
on my shoulder


---------04:20----------
um one thing that uh


---------04:24----------
my entire gaming career i've always had


---------04:26----------
people tell me i don't deserve it


---------04:28----------
and i'm trying to like kind of like tear


---------04:30----------
down my successes


---------04:32----------
um for example in world of warcraft they


---------04:34----------
said i played with the two best players


---------04:36----------
and i was just kind of like


---------04:37----------
carried to winning a bunch of


---------04:39----------
tournaments um


---------04:41----------
and then i won i went pro in a second


---------04:43----------
game called bloodline champions where i


---------04:44----------
won dreamhack


---------04:46----------
they told me that i played with the two


---------04:47----------
best players i know deserve it


---------04:50----------
um pretty much like in every single


---------04:51----------
achievement that i've done in gaming


---------04:53----------
people try to take it away from me but


---------04:55----------
now at this point it's a bit ridiculous


---------04:58----------
like


---------04:58----------
i don't think anyone tried to take away


---------05:00----------
my pogchamps 2 victory


---------05:02----------
um i don't know it's gotten better over


---------05:05----------
the years


---------05:06----------
a game oh it was a chess tournament you


---------05:09----------
know um


---------05:10----------
that streamers get invited too okay uh


---------05:13----------
so they invited all these streamers


---------05:14----------
and um i won


---------05:18----------
yeah it was uh like they it's like


---------05:20----------
hikaru and like


---------05:21----------
the bow test sisters they they coach all


---------05:24----------
like


---------05:24----------
they coach streamers and then the


---------05:26----------
streamers face off


---------05:28----------
um but yeah lately lately as i've had


---------05:30----------
more and more achievements


---------05:32----------
people have kind of just backed off a


---------05:34----------
bit but they're still


---------05:35----------
you know on the thread there's always


---------05:36----------
that one [ __ ] who just still tries to


---------05:39----------
say that i don't deserve it and stuff


---------05:42----------
it's annoying it's


---------05:43----------
deep down it does annoy me and i always


---------05:45----------
feel like i have something to prove


---------05:47----------
um and that's something i'm working on


---------05:49----------
because whenever i see someone else like


---------05:51----------
botes try to defend herself


---------05:53----------
um to haters telling her like oh you're


---------05:55----------
only successful because you're a pretty


---------05:56----------
girl and some


---------05:57----------
like i'm like oh don't defend yourself


---------05:59----------
you don't need to explain yourself


---------06:00----------
because i feel the same way like you're


---------06:03----------
very energetic


---------06:05----------
oh i've had a lot of coffee


---------06:08----------
but um yeah i feel like i still


---------06:12----------
that's something i want to work on is i


---------06:14----------
don't feel like i


---------06:15----------
should feel the need to prove myself


---------06:17----------
over and over because some people are


---------06:19----------
just going to


---------06:21----------
tear down my achievements no matter what


---------06:23----------
i do or what i accomplish or how many


---------06:25----------
things i've done you know


---------06:26----------
and um but i can't help it


---------06:30----------
i always feel like i need to prove


---------06:32----------
myself


---------06:34----------
yeah where does that come from um like i


---------06:37----------
said just


---------06:38----------
when i was younger it's just all i heard


---------06:41----------
i


---------06:41----------
i've always felt like each one of my


---------06:45----------
achievements is like an echo chamber of


---------06:46----------
like


---------06:47----------
people being like you don't actually


---------06:48----------
deserve it and you just got lucky or


---------06:50----------
like


---------06:51----------
you only have viewers because you're


---------06:52----------
female or you know


---------06:54----------
there's always some excuse and um


---------06:58----------
you're not actually that good blah blah


---------07:00----------
here are some stats um


---------07:04----------
and i oh god i got into it with my


---------07:07----------
fiance because he's


---------07:08----------
he's really really good at games and he


---------07:11----------
doesn't understand


---------07:13----------
my struggle okay so one of our biggest


---------07:14----------
fights was like


---------07:16----------
he doesn't understand the kind of


---------07:18----------
comments that i get


---------07:19----------
as an asian female versus him being a


---------07:22----------
white male


---------07:23----------
and like i don't know like no one really


---------07:26----------
tries to tear his achievements down


---------07:28----------
and i would try to explain that to him


---------07:30----------
and he didn't understand it at first but


---------07:32----------
now he


---------07:33----------
like kind of can see more from my point


---------07:36----------
of view


---------07:37----------
that just um yes i don't know


---------07:40----------
maybe it's not stupid but it feels like


---------07:42----------
girls have a lot more to prove


---------07:45----------
in the gaming space sure what does he


---------07:48----------
understand now that he didn't understand


---------07:50----------
before


---------07:52----------
that there's inherent biases in that


---------07:55----------
like no one


---------07:56----------
questions his achievements the way that


---------07:57----------
they try to pick apart mine


---------08:00----------
for the validity of mine whenever he


---------08:02----------
wins something he doesn't have people be


---------08:03----------
like okay but he's not that good like he


---------08:05----------
doesn't get those kinds of comments


---------08:06----------
sure and he did yeah it's just like


---------08:09----------
because he doesn't get it


---------08:11----------
he thinks that it's fine when i get mine


---------08:14----------
i don't know he can't relate to it at


---------08:15----------
all because it doesn't happen to him


---------08:17----------
and for the um sorry


---------08:20----------
oh i mean the example i always use that


---------08:23----------
helped him realize


---------08:24----------
was i was on his stream and someone


---------08:26----------
called me a corona [ __ ]


---------08:28----------
and i was like they're tagging in one


---------08:31----------
little phrase


---------08:32----------
they're attacking my gender and my race


---------08:34----------
right things that i'm are out of my


---------08:35----------
control


---------08:37----------
and for him he was complaining that


---------08:38----------
people said his voice was boring


---------08:40----------
and i was like you don't see how these


---------08:43----------
are different


---------08:44----------
these are like they come from a


---------08:47----------
different place


---------08:48----------
i don't know so what i'm hearing is that


---------08:50----------
sort of early on


---------08:52----------
he wasn't appreciating the significance


---------08:55----------
yeah of course we have struggles right


---------08:59----------
yeah but i mean he it sounds like maybe


---------09:01----------
he was equating some of his struggles to


---------09:03----------
some of your struggles and you felt like


---------09:05----------
that was an unfair comparison


---------09:07----------
yes yeah that every he says like


---------09:11----------
everyone gets bad comments


---------09:12----------
yeah and i was like yeah excited but


---------09:14----------
it's not the same


---------09:16----------
it's not the same thing yeah it would


---------09:18----------
always annoy me


---------09:19----------
what's different about it well


---------09:24----------
one is completely out of my control


---------09:25----------
they're attacking things that i'm born


---------09:27----------
with


---------09:28----------
and have nothing to do with even the


---------09:30----------
game


---------09:31----------
right they're just like basically um


---------09:35----------
just attacking me as a human being


---------09:38----------
instead of like an aspect about me i


---------09:40----------
guess


---------09:41----------
so they're not calling you a shitty


---------09:43----------
player which oh they did that too


---------09:45----------
but you know they do that with the other


---------09:48----------
stuff


---------09:48----------
and um i don't know i just always felt


---------09:52----------
like i had to


---------09:55----------
defend myself for why i got viewers or


---------09:57----------
um


---------09:59----------
i don't know dumb stuff


---------10:05----------
can i think for a second yeah


---------10:20----------
my child wants to tell me to say no when


---------10:25----------
you can say no can i think for a second


---------10:27----------
everyone's like say no


---------10:29----------
say no yeah


---------10:33----------
i just think it's funny that is it a


---------10:35----------
meme from your stream


---------10:37----------
yep sorry okay it has trickled over


---------10:40----------
so i do something pretty unusual which i


---------10:43----------
i guess you know has become


---------10:46----------
specific to me which is that sometimes


---------10:48----------
in conversation i actually pause to


---------10:49----------
think


---------10:50----------
and i don't just keep talking yeah


---------10:52----------
that's fair


---------10:53----------
um i think it's good too but


---------10:56----------
you know by all means say no to satisfy


---------10:58----------
your chat and let's see what happens


---------11:00----------
because no one's ever said no


---------11:01----------
no no no someone's gonna do it one day


---------11:04----------
yeah so okay hafu let's


---------11:07----------
let's talk about so um


---------11:11----------
all right so you feel like you've got


---------11:12----------
something to prove


---------11:15----------
yes yeah and i know that i shouldn't


---------11:17----------
feel that way


---------11:18----------
but i can't help but feel that way why


---------11:21----------
shouldn't you feel that way


---------11:25----------
because you can't ever please everyone


---------11:27----------
and there's some people who are just


---------11:29----------
i don't know they just live to tear


---------11:30----------
other people down so i'm gonna


---------11:33----------
thank god i'm gonna just point something


---------11:36----------
out so i shouldn't feel that way


---------11:41----------
i think that that doesn't help you solve


---------11:43----------
the problem


---------11:45----------
well feeling up getting upset about it


---------11:49----------
doesn't fix the problem


---------11:52----------
yes agreed so getting getting upset


---------11:54----------
about a problem doesn't fix a problem


---------11:56----------
but when you get upset about your a


---------11:58----------
problem and then you beat yourself


---------12:00----------
up for it anyway by telling yourself i


---------12:03----------
shouldn't feel this way


---------12:04----------
you're actually like joining the enemy


---------12:08----------
right because what you're doing is yes


---------12:11----------
so this is weird so i i want you to just


---------12:12----------
think about this


---------12:13----------
let's say that like you know i feel


---------12:15----------
insecure about


---------12:19----------
my face okay okay and then then if i


---------12:22----------
feel insecure about my face like what's


---------12:24----------
you know that like telling myself that i


---------12:26----------
shouldn't feel insecure


---------12:28----------
is actually like invalidating the way


---------12:29----------
that i feel right so imagine for a


---------12:31----------
second that you you told your boyfriend


---------12:33----------
you know when i get called a corona [ __ ]


---------12:35----------
on stream it's different from people


---------12:37----------
commenting on your voice


---------12:38----------
and then he says you shouldn't feel that


---------12:40----------
way


---------12:42----------
how would you respond to him i slapped


---------12:45----------
the [ __ ] out of him


---------12:46----------
absolutely right


---------12:50----------
but when you feel insecure about


---------12:52----------
yourself and then you tell yourself


---------12:54----------
the same thing what do you do to


---------12:57----------
yourself


---------12:58----------
i don't think i'm a corona [ __ ]


---------13:02----------
yeah but my point is that like you tell


---------13:04----------
yourself you shouldn't feel that way and


---------13:06----------
that's totally cool


---------13:08----------
but if he tells you you shouldn't feel


---------13:09----------
that way it's the same message


---------13:11----------
but if it's coming from your mind or his


---------13:13----------
mouth the response is completely


---------13:15----------
different do you see that


---------13:16----------
yeah it's a bad message but we tell


---------13:19----------
ourselves that for like


---------13:21----------
i don't we'll get into that but i just


---------13:22----------
want to point that out to you that like


---------13:24----------
actually if you stop and think about it


---------13:25----------
it's absurd and all we have to do is


---------13:28----------
transmit your thoughts to his mouth and


---------13:30----------
then you quickly see that like it's like


---------13:32----------
not


---------13:32----------
actually okay to not feel that way


---------13:35----------
but don't you think that i should


---------13:40----------
if i pay too much attention to all the


---------13:42----------
negative things don't you think


---------13:43----------
streamers would just collapse


---------13:47----------
i think let me let me rephrase i think


---------13:49----------
or


---------13:50----------
reframe the question if they pay


---------13:52----------
attention to too many negative things


---------13:53----------
would they collapse


---------13:54----------
probably but i feel like yeah yeah go


---------13:57----------
ahead


---------13:58----------
oh just you know i i mean you're a


---------14:00----------
streamer so i'm sure you can relate to


---------14:02----------
this but like


---------14:03----------
stream i mean for streamers and anyone


---------14:06----------
in the public eye you get like


---------14:08----------
thousands and thousands of affirmations


---------14:10----------
right and then


---------14:12----------
for the one for the few people who are


---------14:14----------
loud and


---------14:16----------
rude you still those stick out more


---------14:19----------
than the thousands of affirmations right


---------14:22----------
is that not


---------14:23----------
that's pretty normal no that's pretty


---------14:24----------
normal for streamers


---------14:26----------
yes that's what i'm saying so like i


---------14:30----------
i know that if i like focus on


---------14:33----------
only the negatives it will overrule me


---------14:35----------
so what i try to do is just to ignore


---------14:37----------
them


---------14:39----------
yep yeah i understand so so cool so this


---------14:42----------
is why i was thinking because this is


---------14:43----------
going to be tricky to navigate but it's


---------14:45----------
going to be awesome


---------14:46----------
so you have developed an adaptive system


---------14:49----------
right so like let's just


---------14:50----------
think off i'm going to pull out an ipad


---------14:52----------
in a second okay


---------14:54----------
so should i do it now let me think about


---------14:57----------
that


---------14:59----------
no i'm not allowed to think okay okay so


---------15:02----------
we're gonna do this if you can't fault


---------15:03----------
if it's easier or it's hard to follow me


---------15:05----------
because i'm about to get


---------15:07----------
abstract okay i'm gonna pay attention to


---------15:09----------
my chat


---------15:10----------
you pay attention to your chat and then


---------15:12----------
you let me know if i should bust it out


---------15:13----------
okay


---------15:14----------
so here's the thing you have this idea


---------15:17----------
which is


---------15:18----------
okay i can't afford to focus on the


---------15:20----------
negative


---------15:21----------
therefore when i feel negative i'm gonna


---------15:24----------
fight against that negativity so telling


---------15:26----------
yourself i should


---------15:28----------
i shouldn't feel that way is a fighting


---------15:29----------
against the negativity


---------15:31----------
and essentially an antidote to focusing


---------15:34----------
on the negative from other people


---------15:38----------
no i didn't follow okay i've had time


---------15:45----------
okay so this is this is what i'm saying


---------15:46----------
okay so like you've got


---------15:48----------
there's positive stuff on the internet


---------15:51----------
and there's negative stuff right yes and


---------15:54----------
so the negative stuff


---------15:56----------
from this is from the internet


---------15:59----------
enters your mind so here's your mind


---------16:03----------
okay so then you've got negativity in


---------16:06----------
your mind


---------16:08----------
okay okay so they say for example


---------16:12----------
you don't deserve it


---------16:17----------
okay you uh


---------16:22----------
you don't deserve it


---------16:26----------
so then what happened so like let's just


---------16:28----------
think about this when when you encounter


---------16:30----------
something with your sense organs


---------16:33----------
it enters your mind and then this


---------16:35----------
thought is present in your mind


---------16:40----------
okay so then what happens is in order to


---------16:43----------
block this thought


---------16:45----------
you have another thought you


---------16:49----------
shouldn't care


---------16:52----------
feel that way sure care is better


---------16:55----------
shorter


---------16:57----------
okay now we can't see the ipad that's


---------16:59----------
not my fault hold on hold on


---------17:10----------
good point thanks okay yeah i don't know


---------17:12----------
what you're saying i mean i don't know


---------17:13----------
what you're writing


---------17:15----------
yep thanks a lot


---------17:18----------
missed okay so we gotta i forgot one


---------17:21----------
step


---------17:22----------
oh oh there we go okay ah


---------17:26----------
oh okay i was like okay you're just


---------17:28----------
writing stuff okay okay i'm gonna


---------17:29----------
okay zoom in on that one so so let me


---------17:31----------
walk you through this again okay


---------17:34----------
no no it's not okay i'm a boomer because


---------17:37----------
i'm


---------17:37----------
okay so this is the positive and


---------17:39----------
negative stuff


---------17:40----------
is over here okay this is from the


---------17:42----------
outside this is your mind and so it


---------17:44----------
enters your mind and then this


---------17:46----------
thought gets transmitted from the


---------17:48----------
outside into your mind


---------17:49----------
okay you with me and then what you do so


---------17:52----------
this is the


---------17:53----------
you know in terms of like biochemistry


---------17:54----------
and neuroscience and stuff we use this


---------17:56----------
symbol to imply


---------17:57----------
inhibition okay okay


---------18:01----------
so and then so this is the thought that


---------18:02----------
you tell yourself to


---------18:04----------
[Music]


---------18:05----------
fight against this idea that you don't


---------18:07----------
deserve it you with me


---------18:09----------
yes okay but now now as we pointed out


---------18:13----------
this thought is actually invalidating


---------18:18----------
right you remember like why so so so


---------18:22----------
because like like we said with your


---------18:23----------
boyfriend like if you feel


---------18:25----------
bad in a particular way and your


---------18:27----------
boyfriend says


---------18:28----------
you sure sorry fiance says you shouldn't


---------18:31----------
care you'd slap him across the face


---------18:34----------
yeah right and and so what that means is


---------18:37----------
that like oddly enough


---------18:39----------
when we feel bad about something instead


---------18:42----------
of invalid like like telling ourselves


---------18:46----------
um


---------18:50----------
because when you say you shouldn't care


---------18:52----------
it's sort of like saying like you're


---------18:53----------
stupid for caring


---------18:56----------
uh yeah it's more like


---------19:00----------
yeah go ahead you shouldn't care because


---------19:03----------
if you care every time then


---------19:05----------
like you can't do anything about people


---------19:07----------
like that


---------19:09----------
if you waste energy being upset then you


---------19:11----------
will be upset most of the time


---------19:13----------
i agree so remember this is an


---------19:16----------
adaptive response yeah it's like the


---------19:19----------
best


---------19:21----------
it's not a perfect thing but it's more


---------19:23----------
like the best


---------19:25----------
way to handle it because your brain


---------19:27----------
can't ignore


---------19:28----------
all of the negativity yep but if you


---------19:31----------
focus on the negativity and you allow


---------19:32----------
yourself to get upset over every time


---------19:34----------
and try to defend yourself


---------19:36----------
from it every time then it becomes more


---------19:38----------
and more toxic


---------19:39----------
completely agree completely i think


---------19:43----------
you shouldn't care is the best response


---------19:45----------
that i have


---------19:47----------
i completely agree which is why so so


---------19:50----------
here's the thing


---------19:51----------
when you tell yourself you don't care


---------19:54----------
what happens to this thought


---------20:00----------
that it doesn't matter so what's the


---------20:04----------
chip on your shoulder


---------20:09----------
that there's still people saying that


---------20:10----------
[ __ ] is annoying


---------20:12----------
right so what this means okay so so what


---------20:14----------
this means is like this is still an


---------20:16----------
open wound


---------20:20----------
right like the reason that this is the


---------20:22----------
chip on your shoulder


---------20:23----------
is because this is the feeling that you


---------20:26----------
invalidate for yourself


---------20:28----------
so essentially what your adaptive


---------20:30----------
response does


---------20:31----------
is takes that emotional hurt and makes


---------20:34----------
it


---------20:35----------
dormant right so you suppress it by


---------20:37----------
telling yourself you shouldn't care


---------20:39----------
but the problem is that it continues to


---------20:42----------
live there and you never really get free


---------20:44----------
of it


---------20:45----------
but there's no solution other than like


---------20:49----------
there's no


---------20:52----------
better way to deal with it like i


---------20:54----------
understand what you're saying what i'm


---------20:55----------
doing is sweeping it under the rug


---------20:56----------
right yep very good yes i understand


---------20:59----------
but there's nothing i can do i can't do


---------21:02----------
anything about it i can't


---------21:04----------
i can't yeah i feel like that's the best


---------21:08----------
way to handle it


---------21:09----------
do you suggest another way to handle it


---------21:10----------
absolutely i'm going to teach you


---------21:12----------
another way


---------21:12----------
oh okay right so so it


---------21:15----------
totally okay so let's talk for a second


---------21:18----------
all right so hold on


---------21:19----------
no [ __ ]


---------21:23----------
oh this will be interesting yeah because


---------21:26----------
whenever i've thought about this it was


---------21:28----------
like


---------21:28----------
there's nothing i can do to control


---------21:30----------
other people so the best way


---------21:32----------
i can oh [ __ ] hung up on her


---------21:35----------
sorry hello yeah sorry i just was i


---------21:38----------
tried to stop screen sharing with you


---------21:39----------
and hung up on you instead because


---------21:41----------
oh you're all good you're all good okay


---------21:45----------
yeah i mean from my perspective it's the


---------21:47----------
best way because


---------21:49----------
there is no other solution i i


---------21:51----------
understand where you're coming from and


---------21:53----------
i think that's what gets us into these


---------21:54----------
problems is that


---------21:55----------
we've lost the understanding of like how


---------21:58----------
this stuff works


---------21:59----------
so i i think that that it's very good


---------22:03----------
that you have developed this adaptive


---------22:05----------
response


---------22:07----------
but i think that in general if we want


---------22:09----------
to grow as people what happens is that


---------22:11----------
our minds and our brains


---------22:13----------
come up with the best answer that they


---------22:15----------
know how and when did you start


---------22:18----------
telling yourself that you shouldn't feel


---------22:20----------
that way


---------22:22----------
um i'm gonna cry


---------22:25----------
but i used to just get a lot of


---------22:27----------
harassment


---------22:28----------
on twitch and


---------22:33----------
oh i'm gonna cry i knew it's gonna cut


---------22:35----------
at some point but just


---------22:36----------
it used to be really bad for me and


---------22:40----------
twitch didn't have any systems to


---------22:42----------
protect streamers


---------22:46----------
and i had to make the choice between


---------22:48----------
like streaming


---------22:50----------
or quitting right like i either had to


---------22:53----------
just live


---------22:54----------
with it in order to quit and i almost


---------22:57----------
did quit


---------22:59----------
i almost did quit um


---------23:02----------
it's gotten so much better over the


---------23:04----------
years and


---------23:06----------
i don't face any of that now so it's in


---------23:09----------
the past


---------23:10----------
but is it a lot of it is it's like


---------23:14----------
i can't even express how bad it was


---------23:18----------
i can't even express how bad it was it


---------23:20----------
was so [ __ ] bad back then


---------23:24----------
but you know it was my career and i


---------23:26----------
always felt like


---------23:28----------
you know streaming is my job i dropped


---------23:30----------
out of college where it's something i


---------23:31----------
love doing


---------23:33----------
and just felt like i had to uh


---------23:38----------
i had to suck it up or i had to quit


---------23:41----------
and so i really tried to suck it up for


---------23:42----------
a long long long time and i got to a


---------23:44----------
breaking point and i almost did quit


---------23:46----------
and i don't even remember why i didn't


---------23:49----------
but um


---------23:53----------
yeah i mean i i have no complaints


---------23:56----------
anymore


---------23:57----------
i have a really nice community and


---------23:59----------
everyone's nice and everyone else's


---------24:00----------
communities too whenever i collab with


---------24:02----------
people


---------24:03----------
and it's been so much better um


---------24:06----------
but i felt like if i didn't have the


---------24:08----------
attitude that i would just break


---------24:09----------
you know like i couldn't do anything


---------24:12----------
else about it


---------24:13----------
it was so bad that i would bottle it up


---------24:18----------
and then just like break down once every


---------24:20----------
month


---------24:22----------
it'd be like when i'm pmsing or


---------24:23----------
something and i i like couldn't handle


---------24:25----------
it


---------24:26----------
i'd take a day off and i would just cry


---------24:28----------
every month


---------24:31----------
i haven't cried in so long to be honest


---------24:34----------
but i remember it was so so


---------24:40----------
so hard but i mean what else could i do


---------24:44----------
like i don't know it felt like it was


---------24:46----------
the only thing i knew how to do was


---------24:47----------
stream


---------24:49----------
so i just felt like i should just suck


---------24:50----------
it up


---------24:52----------
it sounds like you felt really trapped


---------24:55----------
yeah


---------24:55----------
really really trapped


---------25:00----------
but yeah like i said it's gotten so much


---------25:02----------
better now and


---------25:03----------
times are changing and like i don't know


---------25:06----------
harassment used to be like cool


---------25:08----------
like 10 years ago it really was


---------25:11----------
and i feel like that has changed and i


---------25:13----------
can't emphasize how grateful i am for


---------25:15----------
like twitch


---------25:17----------
you know like there's auto mod there's


---------25:19----------
like i don't know


---------25:21----------
a lot of there's just a lot more tools


---------25:23----------
to help streamers


---------25:26----------
and uh yeah i haven't i haven't even


---------25:29----------
thought about it in so long


---------25:30----------
i've just been so grateful the last few


---------25:32----------
years i've been very happy and


---------25:35----------
i yeah i don't have that to complain


---------25:38----------
about anymore


---------25:39----------
for sure sorry i'm crying a lot


---------25:44----------
but yeah it was definitely something i


---------25:46----------
had to teach myself was just to care


---------25:48----------
less


---------25:49----------
because i i remember talking to destiny


---------25:51----------
about this


---------25:52----------
uh you know destiny the stream right


---------25:54----------
he's a good friend of mine


---------25:57----------
and he's like the only thing you can do


---------25:58----------
is let it not affect you because


---------26:00----------
there's nothing you can do to control


---------26:02----------
other people


---------26:03----------
because it's not gonna stop and i was


---------26:06----------
like yeah that's right


---------26:07----------
i have to change how i think about it


---------26:09----------
because it's like the only thing i can


---------26:10----------
do


---------26:12----------
and um so yeah that's how i handled it


---------26:14----------
for years and years


---------26:17----------
so halfway i'm gonna do something a


---------26:20----------
little bit unorthodox


---------26:21----------
so a lot of times when people come on


---------26:23----------
stream and they share


---------26:24----------
powerful feelings i try to explore those


---------26:27----------
feelings with them


---------26:28----------
to sort of help them work through it not


---------26:31----------
gonna do that right now


---------26:32----------
we can do it in a little bit okay how do


---------26:36----------
you


---------26:36----------
understand you used to cry a lot


---------26:39----------
right and what i said is that when you


---------26:42----------
tell yourself


---------26:45----------
let me just walk you through


---------26:48----------
what my opinion is okay just so we can


---------26:50----------
kind of get to this point


---------26:53----------
so you get hate from the internet it


---------26:54----------
hurts


---------26:56----------
you this whole emotion that you're


---------26:59----------
feeling started with the question


---------27:01----------
when did you start or when did you learn


---------27:03----------
to tell yourself


---------27:05----------
not to care and when i was explaining i


---------27:09----------
said that


---------27:09----------
when you when you invalidate your own


---------27:11----------
feelings what you cause them to do


---------27:13----------
is to go dormant so it's a symptomatic


---------27:16----------
relief


---------27:17----------
okay it's sort of like saying um


---------27:21----------
you know i can let me just think of a


---------27:24----------
good example so if i've got like


---------27:25----------
you know if i'm sick and i take like


---------27:28----------
ibuprofen or tylenol or acetaminophen


---------27:31----------
it'll make the fever go away but as soon


---------27:33----------
as i


---------27:34----------
as soon as the tylenol wears off the


---------27:36----------
fever comes back


---------27:37----------
yeah right and so what we see is you're


---------27:40----------
constantly telling yourself you


---------27:42----------
shouldn't feel this way you shouldn't


---------27:43----------
feel this way you shouldn't feel this


---------27:44----------
way you're also saying that this is the


---------27:45----------
only thing i knew how to do which is


---------27:47----------
completely


---------27:47----------
understandable because it tends to be


---------27:49----------
how our mind reacts to things


---------27:52----------
so good for you for finding that inner


---------27:54----------
strength to


---------27:55----------
invalidate yourself for years and years


---------27:57----------
and years


---------27:58----------
and then you say that it's in the past


---------28:01----------
and this is my whole point is that like


---------28:04----------
it hasn't solved anything because we can


---------28:07----------
ask you one question


---------28:08----------
and all of those feelings that you've


---------28:10----------
buried and swept under the rug


---------28:12----------
are like right underneath the surface


---------28:14----------
yeah they are they are


---------28:16----------
definitely there but it doesn't i don't


---------28:19----------
have to deal with it anymore


---------28:20----------
so it feels like it's done you know yep


---------28:23----------
yeah it certainly feels that way


---------28:24----------
because you're taking tylenol every day


---------28:26----------
because you're telling yourself you


---------28:28----------
shouldn't care


---------28:29----------
but the reason that you're not at peace


---------28:33----------
is because it's still there and it's


---------28:35----------
like


---------28:36----------
trickling up these thoughts of doubt


---------28:38----------
right because in your mind


---------28:41----------
somewhere along the way


---------28:44----------
so if you tell yourself i shouldn't


---------28:46----------
think this way


---------28:48----------
what that also means is that there is a


---------28:50----------
part of you that does think that way


---------28:53----------
yeah does that make sense so there's


---------28:56----------
actually a part of you that does


---------28:58----------
believe that you don't deserve it


---------29:02----------
which in turn means that since you have


---------29:04----------
that insecurity


---------29:06----------
that's why the things that they say hurt


---------29:08----------
so much


---------29:10----------
because if we look at the nature of


---------29:11----------
insecurity


---------29:13----------
you know people can say a thousand bad


---------29:15----------
things about people


---------29:17----------
but what my mind is going to do is to


---------29:19----------
latch on the one thing


---------29:20----------
that hits where it hurts that's the


---------29:23----------
[ __ ] in my armor


---------29:25----------
yeah that makes sense right and so like


---------29:28----------
you're continuing they're continually


---------29:29----------
like


---------29:30----------
getting through the [ __ ] in your armor


---------29:31----------
and you're continually like healing


---------29:33----------
yourself up by telling yourself you


---------29:34----------
shouldn't have to


---------29:35----------
you know feel this way and so the other


---------29:39----------
solution


---------29:40----------
which is you can't figure this [ __ ] out


---------29:42----------
on your on your own so i think your


---------29:43----------
solution was a good one


---------29:44----------
it's the one that most streamers come up


---------29:46----------
with but the more permanent solution is


---------29:47----------
to


---------29:48----------
fix the [ __ ] in the armor to get to the


---------29:50----------
root of that insecurity


---------29:52----------
because if you get to the root of the


---------29:54----------
insecurity if like someone says


---------29:56----------
if someone starts hating on you for your


---------30:00----------
love of mayonnaise like you're not going


---------30:03----------
to give a [ __ ] about that because


---------30:05----------
you're not insecure about your love of


---------30:06----------
mayonnaise right like it just bounces


---------30:09----------
their their hate will just bounce right


---------30:11----------
off of you


---------30:11----------
and i'm sure you've faced a lot of hate


---------30:13----------
in your life but like


---------30:16----------
a lot of it bounces right off right even


---------30:18----------
at the beginning you said that there's a


---------30:19----------
small portion that like cracks through


---------30:22----------
people can say 99 good things and they


---------30:24----------
can even say 10 bad things and then like


---------30:26----------
the one that really like you're worried


---------30:28----------
about is the one that's gonna get


---------30:29----------
through


---------30:31----------
yeah thoughts about this questions


---------30:36----------
um i'm trying to think


---------30:43----------
i don't fully agree because


---------30:46----------
i'm being very honest good i know that


---------30:50----------
i'm [ __ ] good at games


---------30:51----------
and i know that i deserve all of my


---------30:54----------
achievements


---------30:55----------
but it's annoying to have to read on


---------30:57----------
every thread that i do well on


---------30:59----------
people trying to literally


---------31:02----------
you know like leaf through all of my


---------31:05----------
accomplishments to try to belittle them


---------31:07----------
but i genuinely think that i deserve my


---------31:10----------
achievements


---------31:11----------
i would i completely agree so so i don't


---------31:13----------
so this is where what's really confusing


---------31:15----------
for a lot of people is that


---------31:17----------
our mind doesn't think one way


---------31:20----------
right there's a part of your mind i'd


---------31:22----------
say 95


---------31:23----------
of your mind if i just had to give you


---------31:25----------
odds 95


---------31:26----------
of your mind is confident in your


---------31:28----------
achievements and you know that their


---------31:29----------
haters are going to hate


---------31:31----------
yeah the problem is that five percent of


---------31:34----------
you


---------31:34----------
actually believes it which is why you


---------31:36----------
have to tell yourself


---------31:38----------
that you shouldn't feel that way


---------31:42----------
so you can believe that you are


---------31:44----------
confident and you deserve


---------31:46----------
your success and at the same time you


---------31:49----------
can believe that you don't deserve it


---------31:51----------
which is mind-boggling you think you


---------31:53----------
think i really so you think


---------31:55----------
i take offense to it because i really at


---------31:57----------
the root of it


---------31:58----------
don't believe i deserve it not at the


---------32:02----------
root


---------32:02----------
that simultaneously you've got two roots


---------32:05----------
you've got a very big tree


---------32:07----------
which says i do deserve it and right


---------32:09----------
next to it


---------32:10----------
you have a smaller tree which says i


---------32:12----------
don't deserve it


---------32:17----------
but i really do think i deserve it i


---------32:19----------
know you do


---------32:21----------
i think i i think if if if the if that i


---------32:24----------
deserve it tree wasn't


---------32:25----------
as big and strong as it was you wouldn't


---------32:28----------
be able to make it as a streamer


---------32:31----------
what i'm saying is that i can ask you a


---------32:32----------
relatively benign question


---------32:35----------
which is where did you learn how to tell


---------32:37----------
yourself i shouldn't


---------32:38----------
you shouldn't like when i asked a


---------32:40----------
relatively benign question


---------32:41----------
we weren't i didn't like walk you to an


---------32:44----------
emotional


---------32:44----------
point right like yeah i didn't like i


---------32:47----------
was just like i'm drawing a [ __ ]


---------32:48----------
picture on an ipad


---------32:49----------
and then i turn it off and i ask you one


---------32:51----------
question and boom all these emotions


---------32:53----------
come off yeah yeah yeah


---------32:54----------
that tells me that there's something


---------32:57----------
dormant there there's emotional energy


---------32:59----------
that's dormant


---------33:00----------
and we like kind of like struck gold


---------33:03----------
right like just from a mental standpoint


---------33:05----------
no i mean i think being a streamer is


---------33:07----------
really taxing i think everyone


---------33:08----------
whose dreams can relate because you


---------33:12----------
you know you hear so many good things


---------33:14----------
but you also hear a lot of bad things


---------33:16----------
and like you said some of them do


---------33:18----------
get through they do hit some things that


---------33:20----------
make you know


---------33:21----------
hit points of insecurity for sure but um


---------33:26----------
yeah i mean people handle it in


---------33:29----------
different ways i i understand what


---------33:30----------
you're saying but i feel like


---------33:32----------
i can't solve can everyone solve all


---------33:34----------
their insecurities


---------33:38----------
well so the answer to that i believe is


---------33:41----------
yes


---------33:42----------
really yep and you're gonna care about


---------33:44----------
nothing


---------33:45----------
yes what


---------33:49----------
sure zero things so zero things that


---------33:52----------
people say to you


---------33:53----------
affects you yes


---------33:57----------
are you superman dude no so so they they


---------34:00----------
have


---------34:01----------
they have they have a they have a st i


---------34:03----------
mean that's been well described right


---------34:05----------
so like there's this religion called


---------34:07----------
buddhism


---------34:08----------
in this religion called hinduism but the


---------34:11----------
buddhism


---------34:12----------
buddhism okay yeah right and so in


---------34:15----------
buddhism


---------34:16----------
they have a system of training to attain


---------34:18----------
a state of moksha


---------34:20----------
or enlightenment which is a state of


---------34:22----------
eternal bliss


---------34:24----------
which is what you're talking about


---------34:27----------
and the cool thing is that like if we


---------34:28----------
think about it in your case you're


---------34:30----------
saying


---------34:30----------
can you solve all insecurities you don't


---------34:32----------
need to solve all insecurities hafu


---------34:34----------
you need to solve one insecurity


---------34:39----------
[ __ ] the rest of them i mean whatever


---------34:41----------
okay okay right so like later in life


---------34:43----------
you may be if you


---------34:44----------
you know choose or lucky or unlucky


---------34:46----------
enough


---------34:47----------
to have kids however whatever your value


---------34:50----------
system is


---------34:51----------
then i'm sure you're going to get a


---------34:52----------
whole new crop of insecurities about


---------34:53----------
being a sufficient mother


---------34:56----------
so you'll continue to have them but what


---------34:57----------
i'm saying is it seems like there's one


---------34:59----------
insecurity


---------35:00----------
that affects you


---------35:04----------
effect isn't the right word that demands


---------35:06----------
a lot of your cognitive energy


---------35:09----------
on a relatively regular basis that keeps


---------35:12----------
you from being at peace


---------35:13----------
you have to work at it which i don't


---------35:16----------
want for you


---------35:18----------
i want you to just be chill right like i


---------35:21----------
want you to be like


---------35:22----------
free of that and be like have a mind


---------35:24----------
that's like tranquil that doesn't have


---------35:25----------
to fight against that


---------35:27----------
i understand but it's like fighting


---------35:29----------
against systematic like


---------35:31----------
i i hate talking about but like there's


---------35:33----------
sexism right there's like


---------35:35----------
definitely misogyny on twitch just in


---------35:37----------
gaming in general because it's so male


---------35:39----------
dominated


---------35:39----------
sure and so i feel like i'm fighting


---------35:42----------
against that which is so ridiculous like


---------35:44----------
instead of fighting against it just to


---------35:47----------
be at peace with it


---------35:48----------
does that make sense i know i'm not


---------35:50----------
fully at peace but that's what it feels


---------35:51----------
like i'm trying to fight


---------35:52----------
it's like that's not a war i wanna wage


---------35:55----------
i don't wanna like


---------35:56----------
but you fight the battle already yeah


---------36:02----------
but it's just some people you just i


---------36:05----------
don't know


---------36:07----------
because it affects me that then yeah


---------36:08----------
yeah i'm not talking about dealing with


---------36:10----------
toxicity or masculinity or


---------36:13----------
male dominated whatever you say twitch


---------36:14----------
has gotten a lot better what i'm talking


---------36:16----------
about


---------36:17----------
what i'm talking about is that despite


---------36:19----------
the fact that twitch has gotten a lot


---------36:20----------
better you carry this thing with you


---------36:22----------
it's a chip on your shoulder


---------36:24----------
and what i am hypothesizing to you is


---------36:27----------
that there is a


---------36:28----------
method to get the chip off your shoulder


---------36:31----------
and it has nothing to do with fixing the


---------36:33----------
internet


---------36:39----------
go ahead question i think it's a chip


---------36:43----------
that every girl has to


---------36:44----------
kind of wear on that's sad


---------36:48----------
and if i had my way it is sad but it's


---------36:51----------
the truth and i mean the world isn't


---------36:52----------
perfect but it's getting better


---------36:54----------
and that's fine and like i mean


---------36:57----------
it's a world that i it's a world that i


---------36:59----------
choose to live in right like i'm


---------37:00----------
choosing to be a streamer and i


---------37:02----------
i mean my demographic on twitch was 97


---------37:06----------
male until this year and then i have


---------37:08----------
like a 20


---------37:09----------
female fan base now like it's it's


---------37:11----------
because of the numbers right like


---------37:13----------
you can't help it when i don't i don't


---------37:15----------
agree


---------37:16----------
so here's here's what it is yeah sure


---------37:20----------
yeah so so so let me let me let me share


---------37:23----------
my


---------37:23----------
perspective the world is gonna be what


---------37:26----------
it is


---------37:26----------
we can't control the world i completely


---------37:28----------
agree if you're a female streamer


---------37:30----------
are you gonna have to deal with toxicity


---------37:32----------
and hatred due to your


---------37:34----------
race the various fetishes of your


---------37:37----------
audience


---------37:38----------
and your gender absolutely i completely


---------37:40----------
agree with you that you


---------37:42----------
cannot fix that i also agree with you


---------37:44----------
that if you are a female streamer


---------37:46----------
on twitch you are going to have to deal


---------37:48----------
with that yes


---------37:50----------
i completely agree can you change that


---------37:53----------
actually i'm not going to say you can't


---------37:54----------
change that because


---------37:55----------
with concerted effort as a community we


---------37:57----------
can change that


---------37:58----------
but what i'm saying is that all of that


---------38:00----------
is outside of you okay and the outside


---------38:05----------
world


---------38:06----------
sends things it's like i want you to


---------38:08----------
think about the barrier of your house


---------38:10----------
right and there's a lot of stuff going


---------38:12----------
on outside and some things from outside


---------38:15----------
of your house


---------38:16----------
enter into your house yes they cross the


---------38:19----------
plain


---------38:19----------
of the outside world and into your mind


---------38:23----------
and what i'm saying is that a chip you


---------38:24----------
can have so


---------38:26----------
i'm trying to help the


---------38:29----------
internet with their mental health it is


---------38:31----------
a huge problem


---------38:33----------
but it is not a chip on my shoulder it


---------38:36----------
is not something that causes me pain


---------38:38----------
it is not something that i struggle with


---------38:40----------
every day in fact it does the exact


---------38:42----------
opposite it's a buff the weight of the


---------38:46----------
problem that i'm trying to solve


---------38:49----------
allows me because of the way i mean now


---------38:51----------
i'm gonna sound kind of


---------38:52----------
you know like i'm awesome which okay


---------38:56----------
but because of the way that i've been


---------38:58----------
taught


---------38:59----------
to train my mind the weight of the


---------39:01----------
challenges against me


---------39:03----------
gives me fuel yeah yeah yeah


---------39:06----------
right and i know everyone understands


---------39:08----------
that like i know you've been in that


---------39:09----------
situation where


---------39:10----------
you have dealt with really painful


---------39:13----------
challenging


---------39:14----------
in unsolvable circumstances and that's


---------39:16----------
when you go super saiyan


---------39:19----------
and what i'm telling you is that it is


---------39:21----------
my belief and has been my experience


---------39:24----------
that despite the world being the way


---------39:26----------
that it is when it crosses into your


---------39:28----------
mind


---------39:29----------
based on the way that you your mind has


---------39:32----------
evolved to deal with that


---------39:34----------
has left has allowed you to survive but


---------39:36----------
has cost you peace


---------39:39----------
and what i'm saying is that there's a


---------39:40----------
possibility that there's a different way


---------39:44----------
and that you resist that is wonderful


---------39:50----------
i'll i'm gonna try to convince you but


---------39:53----------
is great


---------39:55----------
well it's like


---------39:59----------
okay i i yeah i think i'm understanding


---------40:01----------
what you're saying


---------40:04----------
but i don't agree that


---------40:11----------
you're saying that you can control what


---------40:12----------
comes into your barrier right


---------40:14----------
is that what you're saying yes what you


---------40:17----------
bring in


---------40:18----------
and i'm saying that i don't think that's


---------40:19----------
possible of course


---------40:22----------
of course you i feel like if you try to


---------40:24----------
control that too much


---------40:28----------
i just that's that's a big battle dude


---------40:31----------
you're damn right it is


---------40:32----------
i'm not willing to fight that war


---------40:35----------
okay okay so so so that's fair so i


---------40:38----------
think you're right


---------40:39----------
actually so you say it may be impossible


---------40:42----------
but what i'm really hearing you saying


---------40:44----------
is that sounds


---------40:45----------
[ __ ] exhausting and it is very it's


---------40:48----------
exhausting


---------40:49----------
it's very difficult and it's not


---------40:55----------
say it yeah finish your thoughts not


---------40:57----------
worth it


---------40:59----------
because like


---------41:02----------
okay the base example is like let's say


---------41:04----------
a girl and a guy are playing a


---------41:06----------
competitive game


---------41:07----------
they both have 20 000 viewers


---------41:10----------
which streamer do which one of them do


---------41:13----------
you think is better at the game


---------41:18----------
i think people always think the guy is


---------41:19----------
better i i have no idea


---------41:22----------
okay i'm just saying this is like the


---------41:24----------
it's like it's like an instant


---------41:25----------
assumption


---------41:26----------
that the guy is [ __ ] good at the game


---------41:29----------
and that's


---------41:30----------
what that's like an instant bias and


---------41:33----------
it's not like a


---------41:34----------
very harmful bias but it also is at the


---------41:36----------
same time


---------41:37----------
and that's the kind of thing that i feel


---------41:39----------
like it's not worth fighting against


---------41:40----------
because


---------41:41----------
it's you know biases happen for a reason


---------41:43----------
it's not rights but it's just how it is


---------41:45----------
i assume that the guy is better and


---------41:48----------
that's [ __ ] up


---------41:50----------
i'm just saying there's like a lot of


---------41:52----------
things that are just ingrained


---------41:54----------
that it's just uh you can't change the


---------41:57----------
world


---------41:57----------
inst you know like you can't change the


---------41:58----------
twitch world instantly it's because what


---------42:01----------
am i talking about changing


---------42:03----------
what's your understanding of what i'm


---------42:05----------
talking about changing where is the


---------42:06----------
effort that we're putting in


---------42:07----------
what direction is it pointed is it


---------42:10----------
pointed outside of the house or inside


---------42:11----------
the house


---------42:12----------
yeah but i would my stream be inside my


---------42:15----------
house


---------42:15----------
would my chat be inside my house very


---------42:17----------
good question


---------42:19----------
what do you think because if it is


---------42:21----------
because i would say you would consider


---------42:22----------
it is because that's the stuff you're


---------42:24----------
allowing


---------42:25----------
to enter your mind right okay so


---------42:28----------
so so yeah so this is exactly so


---------42:31----------
yeah okay cool so let me start with this


---------42:34----------
you said this sounds really hard and it


---------42:35----------
sounds like it's not worth it and i


---------42:37----------
completely agree with you so there's a


---------42:39----------
reason why very few people


---------42:40----------
attain enlightenment and the whole


---------42:43----------
reason the


---------42:44----------
little tidbit from my bio the whole


---------42:46----------
reason i became a doctor is because my


---------42:48----------
spiritual teachers told me that


---------42:50----------
unless you be can become incredibly


---------42:52----------
successful in the material world


---------42:54----------
that's like the prologue for like


---------42:57----------
playing the spiritual game


---------42:58----------
because enlightenment is way harder than


---------43:00----------
anything you can achieve and at that


---------43:02----------
point


---------43:02----------
i almost failed out of college was had a


---------43:04----------
2.2 less than a 2.0 gpa


---------43:07----------
and they were like if you can't make it


---------43:09----------
in the real world you're not going to


---------43:10----------
make it over here


---------43:11----------
and then they told me at the age of 21


---------43:13----------
go back to school


---------43:14----------
become as accomplished as you can


---------43:16----------
possibly be become as successful as you


---------43:18----------
can possibly be in the real world


---------43:20----------
and come back when you're 30. and if you


---------43:22----------
haven't made it in the material world


---------43:23----------
we're not interested


---------43:26----------
so you're right sorry this is for


---------43:29----------
religion yep i tried to become they can


---------43:32----------
do that


---------43:32----------
they can do this that


---------43:35----------
i thought religion was all accepting


---------43:40----------
no oh right so so you're right


---------43:45----------
you're okay sorry i know nothing about


---------43:46----------
religion no yeah i don't think it's


---------43:48----------
really religion


---------43:49----------
i think hafu you're right that you say


---------43:51----------
this sounds really really hard and it


---------43:54----------
sounds like it's not worth it and i'm


---------43:55----------
telling you that your instinct is


---------43:56----------
correct


---------43:57----------
it is cognitively very very exhausting


---------44:00----------
it's a lot of work and it's very


---------44:01----------
difficult


---------44:02----------
to attain to train your mind to the


---------44:05----------
point where the outside world no longer


---------44:06----------
affects you


---------44:08----------
but it's possible


---------44:12----------
now this is where like when we get down


---------44:13----------
to it what i'm talking about halfway has


---------44:15----------
nothing to do with changing the outside


---------44:17----------
world


---------44:17----------
it has to do with putting the chip


---------44:19----------
taking the chip off of your shoulder


---------44:20----------
and what i'm saying and this is tricky


---------44:22----------
because i'm not saying that you don't


---------44:24----------
care


---------44:24----------
what i'm saying is that it's it's hard


---------44:26----------
because you just have to feel it to know


---------44:28----------
what it is


---------44:28----------
you can fight for a cause without that


---------44:31----------
cause hurting you


---------44:33----------
you can believe in doing something that


---------44:35----------
is good and right and righteous and just


---------44:37----------
without it hurting you now oftentimes


---------44:42----------
the root to that fight comes from your


---------44:44----------
own personal suffering


---------44:46----------
which is exactly what happened in my


---------44:47----------
case because i was 21 playing too many


---------44:49----------
video games and


---------44:50----------
like lost and directionless and so


---------44:54----------
i have a question sorry i'm thinking


---------44:56----------
back about what you're saying


---------44:59----------
because you were saying how let's say


---------45:01----------
someone makes fun of my love for


---------45:02----------
mayonnaise which i hate mayonnaise by


---------45:04----------
the way but yeah but but something


---------45:05----------
that's so insignificant because you


---------45:06----------
don't give a [ __ ] about it that it


---------45:08----------
wouldn't hurt you right


---------45:09----------
yep that's what you're saying yep but


---------45:11----------
let's just say like


---------45:12----------
someone comes in and calls you what's a


---------45:15----------
very tame insult


---------45:17----------
a dumb ass yeah a noob


---------45:20----------
i have no i don't it's just not very


---------45:24----------
nice


---------45:24----------
like it's it's just annoying you know


---------45:26----------
what i mean to read that


---------45:28----------
it's not like uh i'm not insecure about


---------45:30----------
anything but i wouldn't like that


---------45:32----------
does that make sense i feel like it


---------45:33----------
doesn't have to be that way just a


---------45:34----------
negative comment is a negative comment


---------45:36----------
period


---------45:37----------
even if it doesn't affect you it's still


---------45:39----------
like what the [ __ ] is wrong with you why


---------45:40----------
you come in here and like be an [ __ ]


---------45:41----------
to me


---------45:42----------
that is affecting you no but but


---------45:46----------
you're reacting to it right if it annoys


---------45:49----------
you


---------45:49----------
then it's affecting you


---------45:53----------
i'm trying to think i'm trying to think


---------45:58----------
okay i'm kind of thinking someone says


---------46:06----------
you're a poo-poo head okay someone says


---------46:09----------
everyone comes in and calls you a


---------46:11----------
poo-poo head


---------46:13----------
am i insecure about being a poopoo hood


---------46:15----------
if i just that guy is just trying to be


---------46:17----------
mean to me


---------46:19----------
is that me being insecure one guy's


---------46:23----------
you know like he's just trying to i


---------46:25----------
don't know i kind of think i'm like the


---------46:27----------
most neutral


---------46:28----------
insult that i feel like i wouldn't


---------46:29----------
actually care about but it's still like


---------46:31----------
negative it's


---------46:32----------
it's uh obviously negative and meant to


---------46:35----------
be taken in a negative way


---------46:37----------
it is someone clearly trying to insult


---------46:39----------
you trying to make you feel bad


---------46:40----------
even if it doesn't make you feel bad


---------46:42----------
it's just not nice to see


---------46:44----------
does that make sense sure so i i'm not


---------46:46----------
at so i i'm with you


---------46:48----------
i think so i think that so it's


---------46:50----------
interesting we're stumbling upon


---------46:51----------
something that's very very kind of


---------46:53----------
uh important but i think we're still


---------46:55----------
it's hard for me to jump there so i'm


---------46:57----------
going to try jumping there and i can


---------46:58----------
fill in the gap


---------46:59----------
so sometimes i'll try to teach people


---------47:01----------
that detachment


---------47:03----------
is different from apathy so what i try


---------47:06----------
to do is i'll work with like clients who


---------47:08----------
are like


---------47:09----------
working in let's say investment banking


---------47:10----------
this is my favorite most common example


---------47:12----------
because you see this all the time and


---------47:14----------
they're very ambitious and i tell them


---------47:16----------
you keep suffering because you are


---------47:18----------
ambitious


---------47:19----------
and then they say but if i'm not


---------47:20----------
ambitious how can i do a good job


---------47:24----------
and i tell them you can absolutely do an


---------47:26----------
even better job if you give up your


---------47:28----------
ambition


---------47:29----------
and that gets really really confusing


---------47:30----------
for people oh


---------47:33----------
right so and and this is where this is


---------47:34----------
like this is the this good i'm


---------47:36----------
glad you're pushing back and hopefully i


---------47:37----------
want you to push back as hard as you


---------47:39----------
possibly can


---------47:40----------
okay don't worry i will fantastic right


---------47:44----------
so so let's just think about that for a


---------47:45----------
second here i am


---------47:47----------
trying to educate you and you're pushing


---------47:49----------
back


---------47:50----------
why am i not getting upset


---------47:54----------
because you want me to challenge your


---------47:55----------
ideas so that i understand things better


---------47:58----------
yeah but like but why why do i think


---------48:01----------
that way


---------48:02----------
right i i'm not a different person could


---------48:05----------
say


---------48:05----------
oh she doesn't know what she's talking


---------48:08----------
about


---------48:09----------
i'm the harvard trained psychiatrist i


---------48:11----------
don't know what i'm talking about


---------48:12----------
i mean yeah but why doesn't that piss me


---------48:14----------
off


---------48:16----------
um because it's your prerogative to


---------48:20----------
get me to understand so it's great yeah


---------48:24----------
so


---------48:24----------
question no so my point is that like


---------48:27----------
there is an


---------48:28----------
internal way that i receive what you do


---------48:32----------
that changes my perception of like


---------48:35----------
suffering or joy given the same stimulus


---------48:39----------
but i'm not trying to be like offensive


---------48:42----------
sure but if i was a narcissistic [ __ ]


---------48:44----------
i would take offense anyway


---------48:49----------
so my my point is that if you questioned


---------48:51----------
me because i mean i've


---------48:52----------
worked with people like this i had an


---------48:54----------
interaction with someone like this a


---------48:55----------
couple days ago


---------48:56----------
who like how dare you question me yeah


---------49:00----------
you don't know what the [ __ ] you're


---------49:01----------
talking about i'm a medical doctor and


---------49:03----------
you're not


---------49:05----------
right so like like the stimulus from the


---------49:07----------
outside is the same


---------49:08----------
it's the way that you build your house


---------49:10----------
that allows you to appreciate something


---------49:13----------
that could be like a challenge or


---------49:14----------
confusion or whatever


---------49:16----------
or you could interpret as an insult does


---------49:18----------
that make sense


---------49:21----------
yes yes


---------49:26----------
and so what i'm saying is that like i i


---------49:28----------
just wanted to kind of point that out


---------49:29----------
and i'll kind of get back to like


---------49:30----------
detachment so essentially the reason


---------49:32----------
that i


---------49:32----------
am this way is because i'm not trying to


---------49:33----------
convince you of anything if i was


---------49:35----------
attached to convince you of


---------49:36----------
of convincing you were teaching you


---------49:38----------
something i would be frustrated


---------49:41----------
but instead i'm unattached from that and


---------49:42----------
i say let's have a conversation with


---------49:44----------
hafu


---------49:44----------
and let's see where it goes like this


---------49:46----------
could be fun okay she's pushing back


---------49:48----------
she's resistant to this idea


---------49:49----------
cool let's play with it and see how we


---------49:52----------
can approach it it's all about the


---------49:53----------
attitude


---------49:55----------
yes yeah your attitude yes i mean


---------49:58----------
that's kind of what i think what destiny


---------50:00----------
was trying to tell me was like i have to


---------50:01----------
change my attitude towards it


---------50:03----------
but instead of but you're saying it's


---------50:06----------
how to


---------50:07----------
change your attitude instead of just


---------50:09----------
telling yourself that you shouldn't care


---------50:11----------
right yeah because i i think extremely


---------50:14----------
hard


---------50:15----------
yeah so so here's here's i'll i'll just


---------50:17----------
be


---------50:18----------
explicit for a second so i think that


---------50:20----------
what you have is this ball of undigested


---------50:22----------
emotion


---------50:23----------
which is called a samskar and this is


---------50:25----------
what happens essentially with trauma is


---------50:27----------
like a good example


---------50:28----------
where like i use this example with my


---------50:30----------
kid where like my kid is scared of dogs


---------50:32----------
and so you know if she's walking down


---------50:33----------
the street and she gets bit by a dog one


---------50:35----------
day


---------50:36----------
the next day when she sees a dog across


---------50:38----------
the street


---------50:39----------
she freaks out she gets this upwelling


---------50:42----------
of emotion


---------50:43----------
that is inappropriate to the actual


---------50:45----------
situation


---------50:46----------
yes okay because that emotion is a


---------50:49----------
leftover


---------50:50----------
from like hurt past okay and that some


---------50:53----------
scar


---------50:54----------
is also what we call an insecurity right


---------50:56----------
so if i'm insecure about my appearance


---------50:58----------
it's because i got bullied a lot when i


---------51:00----------
was in grade school


---------51:02----------
and people called me ugly and so then i


---------51:04----------
carry that emotional hurt with me


---------51:06----------
so that when you know when i message


---------51:08----------
someone on tinder and i'm like hey do


---------51:09----------
you want to hang out sometime


---------51:11----------
and they say no my mind fills in the


---------51:13----------
reason that they're saying no


---------51:15----------
is not because i'm a narcissistic


---------51:17----------
[ __ ] it's because i'm


---------51:18----------
not a chad thundercock right yeah


---------51:22----------
like we fill it in based on our past


---------51:24----------
emotional hurts and what i'm telling you


---------51:26----------
is that it's in my experience


---------51:27----------
and i feel pretty confident about this


---------51:29----------
you can digest


---------51:31----------
that emotional energy and once that


---------51:35----------
emotional energy has been digested the


---------51:37----------
insecurity is gone


---------51:44----------
this is essentially what happens in


---------51:46----------
therapy


---------51:48----------
oh yeah i i am skeptical i feel like i


---------51:51----------
cannot


---------51:52----------
like um


---------51:58----------
i don't know yeah i i understand what


---------52:01----------
you're saying but i'm trying to imagine


---------52:04----------
be getting to the state and just like


---------52:06----------
having a hundred like a thousand people


---------52:07----------
come in my chat saying you're [ __ ]


---------52:09----------
ugly and then


---------52:09----------
not caring i'm trying to really imagine


---------52:11----------
that situation


---------52:13----------
and i don't see it happening i don't see


---------52:16----------
that happening


---------52:16----------
yeah so so of course not right so so now


---------52:19----------
now hafu i think your skepticism is very


---------52:21----------
well founded


---------52:22----------
and the simple reason is that sometimes


---------52:25----------
it's hard


---------52:25----------
when we have a wealth of experience that


---------52:29----------
points us one way


---------52:31----------
and then some [ __ ] [ __ ] comes


---------52:33----------
along on twitch and tells you that it


---------52:35----------
doesn't have to be that way


---------52:36----------
and you've been streaming on twitch for


---------52:37----------
how many years oh


---------52:39----------
okay well i'll challenge that one more


---------52:41----------
time okay


---------52:42----------
so the reason let's say like something


---------52:45----------
i'm not insecure about


---------52:47----------
okay i'm blunt right i'm really blunt so


---------52:50----------
let's say


---------52:52----------
a thousand people come to my chat and


---------52:54----------
say you're so [ __ ] passive aggressive


---------52:55----------
what is wrong with you


---------52:57----------
it would get to me because i'm like oh


---------52:59----------
what did i do that was passive


---------53:00----------
aggressive and


---------53:01----------
then i would like really question it and


---------53:03----------
you know but why do you use the term


---------53:05----------
passive aggressive


---------53:06----------
why are you using passive aggressive in


---------53:08----------
this example why do you pick that


---------53:09----------
because i'm not passive aggressive at


---------53:10----------
all i'm just aggressive


---------53:12----------
i'm just blunt so like that would be


---------53:14----------
something i'm not insecure about because


---------53:16----------
i'm no


---------53:16----------
i'm the very opposite you know so i'm


---------53:19----------
trying to


---------53:20----------
think of like something that they could


---------53:21----------
say that's negative about me that i


---------53:23----------
don't feel insecure about at all but


---------53:25----------
still i would address it because i'd be


---------53:26----------
like


---------53:27----------
wait why wouldn't you get that you can


---------53:29----------
continue to address things so this is


---------53:30----------
the where the detachment and apathy are


---------53:32----------
different it doesn't mean that you don't


---------53:33----------
act in the world


---------53:34----------
it just means that you don't suffer


---------53:37----------
because of it okay


---------53:38----------
yeah okay okay yeah i think i wouldn't


---------53:40----------
suffer for that but


---------53:42----------
i think i would suffer a thousand people


---------53:43----------
came and told me i was ugly


---------53:45----------
yup because you're probably a little bit


---------53:47----------
insecure about your appearance


---------53:48----------
like most human beings yeah i guess you


---------53:52----------
don't


---------53:52----------
fully i don't know right so so now we


---------53:55----------
can even see


---------53:56----------
we can yeah hafu i'm glad you're pushing


---------53:58----------
back because i think you're digging


---------53:59----------
yourself into a hole


---------54:01----------
no no no it's good so i know i think


---------54:04----------
it's i think it's very good so so now we


---------54:05----------
can even see


---------54:06----------
another principle of some scars which is


---------54:08----------
that depending on the size


---------54:11----------
of the some scar it's like the weakness


---------54:14----------
in your armor gets


---------54:16----------
weaker and weaker and weaker because in


---------54:19----------
terms of like


---------54:19----------
your you deserving it your some scar


---------54:22----------
there is larger


---------54:24----------
okay and it's not really that you don't


---------54:25----------
deserve to win the sumscar is actually


---------54:27----------
something else which we'll get to in


---------54:28----------
later if we ever get there but it has to


---------54:30----------
do i think more with your loneliness and


---------54:32----------
your isolation and you being put back


---------54:34----------
into a place


---------54:35----------
when you are really hurting because


---------54:36----------
that's the emotion that's the volcanic


---------54:38----------
eruption that we got for you


---------54:39----------
so there's the and the other thing about


---------54:41----------
some scars the tinier the some scar


---------54:43----------
the more comments it's going to take for


---------54:46----------
you to be


---------54:46----------
hurt there crack but for you to yeah


---------54:49----------
right so there was one comment that like


---------54:51----------
and i mean there's a reason why i picked


---------54:53----------
that right so i know which questions to


---------54:54----------
ask because i've sniffed out your some


---------54:56----------
scar


---------54:56----------
and then i have to just like lance it


---------54:57----------
with a you know with a pin


---------54:59----------
it doesn't take a whole lot and the


---------55:00----------
emotion comes rushing out and there are


---------55:02----------
other insecurities that you have


---------55:04----------
that it's gonna take like a drill


---------55:07----------
to get them okay and it just has to do


---------55:11----------
with the size of the emotional energy


---------55:13----------
and let me put it to you this way since


---------55:15----------
we know that they're big sum scars and


---------55:17----------
small sump scars


---------55:18----------
what if i told you that you could take a


---------55:20----------
big sumscar and turn it into a small


---------55:22----------
sumscar


---------55:22----------
if you could feel if you could respond


---------55:25----------
when people say oh you don't deserve it


---------55:27----------
you would respond to it the way that you


---------55:29----------
do if people tell you you're ugly


---------55:31----------
which is that it hurts a little bit but


---------55:33----------
it doesn't really hurt that much


---------55:38----------
would that be worth it


---------55:41----------
the deserving thing it's not really


---------55:44----------
deserving so


---------55:45----------
that's the thing i'm gonna be honest i


---------55:47----------
really think i deserve things


---------55:48----------
i know that's why deserving is a bad is


---------55:50----------
it is a bad it's not really deserving


---------55:52----------
it's not it's not deserving that's not


---------55:54----------
really what the some scar is if you want


---------55:56----------
to get to the sump scar


---------55:58----------
more so thinking back what well the the


---------56:01----------
point at which i cried


---------56:02----------
was thinking about how i used to be so


---------56:06----------
scared to collab with people and kind of


---------56:09----------
like have to


---------56:11----------
deal with chat every day because yeah


---------56:14----------
you know so if you want to get really


---------56:16----------
precise it's not deserving


---------56:17----------
okay yeah yeah it's not that i like that


---------56:20----------
i i know that so


---------56:21----------
here's the reason why deserving brings


---------56:24----------
it out because our brain


---------56:26----------
scans the external environment and tells


---------56:29----------
us when to bring


---------56:30----------
some scar to the surface and what's


---------56:33----------
happening is when people


---------56:35----------
so like my daughter who's been


---------56:36----------
traumatized by a dog if she walks


---------56:38----------
if she sees a cat across the street the


---------56:40----------
some scar doesn't trigger


---------56:43----------
so the only thing it's not the i know


---------56:45----------
you deserve it i've


---------56:46----------
sort of gleaned that but i think what


---------56:48----------
happens is those


---------56:49----------
discussions yeah remind your mind


---------56:53----------
of a time when you felt a particular way


---------56:56----------
so that's like the trigger


---------56:58----------
it looks like a dog and then those


---------57:00----------
emotions which really have nothing to do


---------57:01----------
with deserving because you've built up


---------57:03----------
other some stars over the last decade


---------57:05----------
but that emotional energy


---------57:06----------
is is still there definitely no i don't


---------57:09----------
know i think yeah i think you've hit the


---------57:11----------
i yeah you're right


---------57:15----------
i have internalized a lot of it because


---------57:17----------
that was the best way i knew how


---------57:18----------
to add time yeah and


---------57:22----------
um it definitely still is there


---------57:26----------
but it has gotten better to the point


---------57:28----------
where i don't


---------57:29----------
it used to be stuff i would think about


---------57:31----------
on the daily like


---------57:33----------
it would eat eat at me every day


---------57:35----------
constantly


---------57:36----------
now i don't think about it almost ever


---------57:40----------
and uh yeah like i said i used to have


---------57:42----------
monthly cries like


---------57:44----------
it was like clockwork because you know


---------57:45----------
you have to bottle up somewhere and then


---------57:47----------
at one point it's just overwhelming


---------57:49----------
and then boom cry it out and then just


---------57:50----------
like start sucking up again or sucking


---------57:53----------
yeah yeah just like um


---------57:56----------
ignoring it ignoring it up again yeah


---------57:58----------
sucking it up again


---------58:00----------
and important two letters there yeah


---------58:04----------
and now i know i don't have that like in


---------58:06----------
the last year two years


---------58:08----------
i haven't had that at all i haven't


---------58:09----------
cried


---------58:11----------
because of something like that in over


---------58:13----------
two years


---------58:15----------
so it feels better now but when i think


---------58:17----------
about that time


---------58:21----------
yeah it was just so bad and


---------58:24----------
um i don't know it feels like because it


---------58:27----------
doesn't happen anymore i don't have to


---------58:29----------
deal with it sure it's been swept under


---------58:32----------
the rug


---------58:33----------
yeah but it's like uh you know it's like


---------58:35----------
neatly packed


---------58:36----------
now yeah and dormant yep


---------58:40----------
it's a nice little volcano that has yeah


---------58:43----------
it's dormant it's just


---------58:44----------
yeah so so this is where you know hafu


---------58:47----------
you've got to make a choice


---------58:49----------
okay and so if you want to let it lie


---------58:51----------
dormant you can let it lie dormant the


---------58:53----------
rest of your life


---------58:55----------
and then depending on whether you


---------58:56----------
believe the the hindus


---------58:58----------
would this disagree about this it'll


---------59:00----------
carry with you to the next life


---------59:04----------
um and you know


---------59:08----------
it's a kind of material but in my


---------59:10----------
experience


---------59:12----------
and take this for what you will


---------59:15----------
i'm not pushing you i don't think you


---------59:17----------
need to fix this because i think you're


---------59:18----------
an incredibly strong resilient woman who


---------59:21----------
has learned how to


---------59:23----------
you know adapt to your circumstances


---------59:25----------
learned how to be successful


---------59:26----------
learned how to find happiness you're not


---------59:29----------
that girl who bottles everything up and


---------59:30----------
cries once a month anymore you've like


---------59:32----------
grown into something truly awesome with


---------59:34----------
you


---------59:36----------
and at some point you have to decide


---------59:40----------
whether you want to just let this stuff


---------59:42----------
go


---------59:43----------
completely whether you want to open up


---------59:46----------
the rug


---------59:47----------
because you're right you packaged it


---------59:48----------
very neatly


---------59:50----------
and then get rid of it and i suspect


---------59:53----------
it's going to be far


---------59:54----------
easier than you think it is because when


---------59:57----------
you open it


---------59:58----------
you think i think i know a little bag of


---------60:00----------
trauma that i just


---------60:02----------
don't want to look at yeah it's a very


---------60:05----------
traumatic time in my life yep so let me


---------60:07----------
explain to you


---------60:09----------
let me explain to you why i think it'll


---------60:10----------
be easier than you think


---------60:12----------
it is because you're when you


---------60:16----------
rate its difficulty right so you're pro


---------60:18----------
wow streamers so like


---------60:20----------
you wiped on that mob when you were 17


---------60:24----------
you're not you're not level 17 anymore


---------60:28----------
you're level 29


---------60:30----------
you're not the same person who faced


---------60:32----------
those problems you're a completely


---------60:33----------
different person


---------60:35----------
you're stronger you're more resilient


---------60:37----------
you're more confident you have the


---------60:38----------
support of a loving fiance you have the


---------60:40----------
support of a loving community


---------60:43----------
so you're like partying up and zoning


---------60:45----------
into like


---------60:46----------
what's that [ __ ] low-level instance


---------60:50----------
i quit wow 10 years ago dude i don't


---------60:52----------
anyway


---------60:53----------
i won my tournaments when i was 17. i'm


---------60:56----------
29.


---------60:57----------
yeah so so so what i'm saying is that


---------61:00----------
hafu i think the reason that it'll be


---------61:01----------
easier to deal with than you think about


---------61:03----------
is because


---------61:03----------
your your assessment of the challenge


---------61:06----------
rating of this problem


---------61:07----------
was made when you are way lower level


---------61:10----------
than you are now


---------61:14----------
yeah i don't think so


---------61:23----------
i feel like this is not something i can


---------61:25----------
tackle


---------61:26----------
i'll be honest i'm thinking about it i


---------61:27----------
don't think it's something i can get


---------61:28----------
over


---------61:31----------
yeah so i think that's reasonable


---------61:32----------
because i'm thinking something i have to


---------61:34----------
get over yeah


---------61:35----------
i agree with i understand what you're


---------61:38----------
saying


---------61:39----------
i'm not gonna push you but um i think


---------61:42----------
that


---------61:42----------
it's reasonable to think that you're not


---------61:44----------
gonna be able to go over it because you


---------61:46----------
haven't done it yet


---------61:48----------
right if you go into a raid boss and you


---------61:50----------
wipe 10 times


---------61:52----------
and then i ask you can you down the boss


---------61:54----------
you're gonna be like ah


---------61:56----------
yeah not really so i think that a lot of


---------61:59----------
your resistance is completely


---------62:00----------
understandable because i do think you're


---------62:02----------
someone who relies a lot on your own


---------62:04----------
experience


---------62:05----------
i'd say that you you tend to not have


---------62:08----------
faith in other people's opinions


---------62:10----------
no it's not that i don't have faith in


---------62:12----------
your opinion


---------62:14----------
i don't i don't consider it a bad thing


---------62:15----------
i think it's part of probably part of


---------62:17----------
what's made you successful


---------62:19----------
as successful as you are because you


---------62:20----------
rely so heavily


---------62:22----------
on your own judgment yes right you've


---------62:25----------
come to trust yourself


---------62:27----------
and because the world told you something


---------62:29----------
just think about this for a second


---------62:31----------
the world has been telling you something


---------62:32----------
and you had to learn


---------62:34----------
how to not trust what they're saying


---------62:37----------
and so of course you wouldn't trust me


---------62:39----------
because you've learned how to not


---------62:40----------
trust what other people say you're like


---------62:42----------
i need to do it until i


---------62:44----------
see it taste it and eat it for myself i


---------62:47----------
don't think so


---------62:49----------
yeah now whether that


---------62:52----------
is a part of your interpersonal conflict


---------62:55----------
we can you know


---------62:56----------
[Laughter]


---------62:57----------
no i agree but even when you were


---------63:00----------
passive aggressive you were still quite


---------63:01----------
rigid in your thinking you just didn't


---------63:03----------
let people know


---------63:04----------
this is it's part of your temperament


---------63:07----------
a lot of things


---------63:11----------
yeah i was just able to cycle analyze


---------63:13----------
myself and kind of


---------63:15----------
pick apart it's like well


---------63:18----------
for example like with my ex i would


---------63:21----------
always try to like test him to see if he


---------63:23----------
really loved me


---------63:24----------
and like kind of like pick a fight and


---------63:26----------
stuff and then i noticed i was doing


---------63:27----------
that and i


---------63:28----------
stopped and i would catch myself doing


---------63:30----------
it it's really hard to like look at


---------63:32----------
you know bad parts of yourself


---------63:37----------
but i was actually because of games i


---------63:39----------
was able to do that


---------63:40----------
and um


---------63:44----------
yeah i don't know i'm much happier with


---------63:45----------
who i am now than i was


---------63:47----------
like a decade ago and it wasn't like an


---------63:50----------
overnight thing is like addressing one


---------63:52----------
problem at a time


---------63:53----------
kind of being like why the [ __ ] am i


---------63:54----------
doing this thing like when i think about


---------63:56----------
it from a logical standpoint


---------63:58----------
like it makes no sense and then i can


---------64:01----------
address it from there


---------64:04----------
but yeah it's not like an overnight it


---------64:05----------
wasn't like an overnight realization


---------64:11----------
yeah so how i'm just confused now


---------64:13----------
because you seem to be making a really


---------64:15----------
really great argument for what i'm


---------64:17----------
saying


---------64:18----------
because that's what i'm encouraging you


---------64:20----------
to do so awareness


---------64:22----------
of a some scar is what leads to its


---------64:24----------
emotional digestion


---------64:26----------
and the change does take time it is


---------64:29----------
effortful and you end up way happier at


---------64:32----------
the end of it


---------64:33----------
and if you do that enough times and you


---------64:36----------
get really good at that process of


---------64:37----------
psychoanalyzing yourself


---------64:39----------
noticing what you do and altering it


---------64:43----------
if you do that over and over and over


---------64:44----------
and over and over again at some point


---------64:46----------
you


---------64:46----------
level up in your skill at doing that


---------64:49----------
okay but let's okay let's break down one


---------64:52----------
of them


---------64:53----------
okay example i don't think i'm ugly


---------64:57----------
but i don't think i'm like the most


---------64:58----------
attractive person ever right


---------65:00----------
so i'm not insecure about my looks but i


---------65:03----------
don't love my looks you know i don't


---------65:04----------
think i'm like


---------65:07----------
you know you know like i think at one


---------65:08----------
point you have to just accept who you


---------65:10----------
are


---------65:10----------
it's like do i want to get plastic


---------65:13----------
surgery or


---------65:14----------
am i okay with who i am right like those


---------65:16----------
are your options you can like


---------65:18----------
try to change how you look so you really


---------65:19----------
like how you look or you can accept it


---------65:22----------
right those are your options


---------65:23----------
degree yeah so i've gone with the


---------65:25----------
acceptance route where i'm okay with how


---------65:28----------
i look


---------65:30----------
but it doesn't mean that i that i feels


---------65:32----------
great about how i look right


---------65:34----------
sure so how am i supposed to not how am


---------65:37----------
i supposed to get over if


---------65:38----------
people come in and tell me i'm ugly this


---------65:39----------
is a dumb one but like how am i supposed


---------65:41----------
to just


---------65:42----------
disregard those comments forever if i


---------65:44----------
have to just settle with


---------65:46----------
i'm okay with it but i don't you know


---------65:49----------
well because because so


---------65:50----------
any sense yeah it makes a lot of sense


---------65:52----------
but like so but


---------65:54----------
i feel like yeah so that makes perfect


---------65:58----------
sense because the whole point


---------65:59----------
is that you know you have a small sum


---------66:02----------
scar there


---------66:02----------
and so then you're saying how do i learn


---------66:04----------
to be okay with the some scar because


---------66:06----------
you haven't fully accepted the way that


---------66:07----------
you look


---------66:08----------
because you're unhappy fully no i'm not


---------66:10----------
super unhappy this is like


---------66:12----------
i'm not so it's a tiny yeah but you're


---------66:15----------
not super unhappy with it which also


---------66:17----------
means that you're a little bit unhappy


---------66:19----------
with it


---------66:19----------
yes yes i'm definitely a little unhappy


---------66:21----------
with how it looked but i feel like it's


---------66:22----------
not a real insecurity


---------66:24----------
yeah because it's not a real insecurity


---------66:26----------
it's a baby insecurity


---------66:28----------
but then but then that sun scar how do i


---------66:30----------
get that sunscreen to go away


---------66:32----------
you continue working on it right so so


---------66:35----------
this is where i can show you how to work


---------66:37----------
on a sump scar


---------66:38----------
okay so for that one how would how could


---------66:39----------
we tackle what are you unhappy about


---------66:41----------
with your appearance


---------66:46----------
hate this so much


---------66:50----------
see there it is there's the subscriber


---------66:52----------
you see that right beneath the surface


---------66:54----------
right beneath the surface it's not as


---------66:56----------
small as you think it is hapu


---------66:58----------
i mean


---------67:01----------
no no i know what i don't like about


---------67:04----------
myself but i don't want to like


---------67:06----------
go through all these little things but


---------67:07----------
there are okay there it is no no no no


---------67:10----------
you don't get to get away with that


---------67:11----------
you said i know what i don't like about


---------67:13----------
myself but i don't want to not like that


---------67:15----------
there it is there's the [ __ ] you


---------67:17----------
remember the diagram where you're


---------67:18----------
invalidating the way that you feel


---------67:20----------
the invalidation i wish my pores were


---------67:23----------
smaller


---------67:23----------
i wish my boobs were a little bigger i


---------67:26----------
wish my nose was a little smaller


---------67:28----------
i wish my eyes were a little bigger i


---------67:30----------
wish i had more fuller eyebrows


---------67:32----------
naturally i wish i wish


---------67:35----------
my skin was less oily i wish


---------67:39----------
my butt was bigger i'm working on that


---------67:41----------
i'm going to the gym


---------67:43----------
how does it feel to say that it's fine


---------67:46----------
i'm okay saying all this stuff


---------67:48----------
and that's the thing it's like i'm okay


---------67:50----------
saying it's just weird


---------67:52----------
to say this stuff because i actually am


---------67:54----------
okay


---------67:56----------
stop talking for a second how do you


---------67:59----------
feel what do you notice in yourself


---------68:03----------
what are you feeling right now slightly


---------68:07----------
embarrassed that i have to


---------68:08----------
go through all the flaws yeah right so


---------68:10----------
that's the some scar


---------68:12----------
because if you were truly like if i said


---------68:14----------
i'm fine with my hair


---------68:15----------
i have big pores too i kind of wish my


---------68:18----------
dick was bigger


---------68:20----------
i'm skinny fat i have dad bod like


---------68:24----------
you know i could list the things that i


---------68:26----------
know that are not


---------68:27----------
good about my appearance and i don't


---------68:29----------
really give a [ __ ]


---------68:31----------
like i truly i mean i have a little


---------68:33----------
insecurity there too because i can feel


---------68:35----------
that embarrassment


---------68:36----------
about some of those things and not other


---------68:38----------
things


---------68:39----------
so you do have some insecurities sure


---------68:41----------
i'm not [ __ ] you


---------68:43----------
yeah but i never said i was enlightened


---------68:46----------
yes you did you just told me what are


---------68:48----------
you talking about i said you have no


---------68:50----------
insecurities here like yeah i have no


---------68:51----------
insecurities no no i didn't say


---------68:52----------
i have no clip it and ship it he [ __ ]


---------68:55----------
said it


---------68:56----------
before before i didn't say i have no


---------68:58----------
idea


---------68:59----------
is it possible no i'm not enlightened


---------69:02----------
hafu


---------69:03----------
i'm a [ __ ] twitch noob oh


---------69:06----------
i thought i swear you said you have no


---------69:08----------
one i think you're not insecure about


---------69:10----------
anything you're like yeah


---------69:11----------
nothing that chad could say could it


---------69:13----------
affect me that's what oh i thought oh


---------69:14----------
no no oh yeah yeah so so you didn't say


---------69:17----------
that


---------69:17----------
no i mean i i i say that i really don't


---------69:21----------
get affected by chat that's true


---------69:24----------
but if any but you just admitted to


---------69:27----------
having some


---------69:27----------
insecurities about how you look so if


---------69:30----------
someone in chat said


---------69:31----------
one of those things it wouldn't affect


---------69:32----------
you hasn't yet


---------69:35----------
or much really yeah


---------69:40----------
that doesn't make sense it i know it's


---------69:42----------
confusing because until you experience


---------69:44----------
it


---------69:45----------
until you experience it hafu you're not


---------69:46----------
going to understand i mean like it's


---------69:48----------
just


---------69:48----------
my experience right so part of what i do


---------69:50----------
so this is kind of weird


---------69:51----------
but you can fix an insecurity or what


---------69:54----------
you can do is accept that you're


---------69:55----------
insecure


---------69:56----------
which then keep makes it gives you


---------69:58----------
detachment from it


---------70:00----------
yes i have i feel like i've accepted


---------70:03----------
my insecurities on the way i look


---------70:06----------
because i feel like


---------70:07----------
no no no i'm talking about something


---------70:09----------
else so you can accept your in


---------70:11----------
well no maybe not hold on


---------70:14----------
because um i mean so i just settled


---------70:17----------
i'm just done with that stuff oh yeah


---------70:20----------
see there you go


---------70:20----------
that's kind of that's kind of where it


---------70:22----------
is it feels better yeah


---------70:24----------
yeah yeah yeah yeah so i i mean i don't


---------70:26----------
think i don't think and i certainly hope


---------70:28----------
i've never made this claim or people


---------70:30----------
haven't gotten this impression that i'm


---------70:31----------
enlightened i'm not


---------70:33----------
perfect i've just trained a lot and i do


---------70:35----------
tend to think that i experience


---------70:37----------
less suffering than the average person i


---------70:39----------
believe that


---------70:41----------
right so like generally speaking like


---------70:42----------
even when things don't go well for me


---------70:44----------
like sometimes i'll get upset


---------70:46----------
of course like i noticed that i was


---------70:48----------
actually way more


---------70:50----------
sort of spiritually adept until i had


---------70:52----------
kids and then i noticed all kinds of


---------70:54----------
like attachments arising for a while


---------70:56----------
i tried to fight them for a while and


---------70:58----------
then actually what i realized is that


---------70:59----------
you know what i'm just gonna be attached


---------71:01----------
to my kids


---------71:02----------
and that's okay and i sort of let go or


---------71:05----------
accepted the fact that i was going to be


---------71:08----------
attached and i would never become


---------71:09----------
enlightened so i sort of was like


---------71:11----------
okay


---------71:15----------
not going to be able to do that anymore


---------71:20----------
but anyway i apologize if i gave you the


---------71:22----------
impression that i was


---------71:23----------
perfect in in because i'm really i


---------71:26----------
really


---------71:27----------
i just remember when i asked you i was


---------71:29----------
like wait you have no insecurities and


---------71:30----------
you're like no


---------71:32----------
i'm sorry you said that i'm pretty sure


---------71:34----------
i didn't say i had no insecurities


---------71:37----------
but maybe i misspoke


---------71:40----------
i mean this is being streamed on twitch


---------71:42----------
so people can go back and yeah i know


---------71:44----------
people are saying you did say it people


---------71:47----------
said he did say it


---------71:49----------
he's gaslighting you okay so he did i


---------71:51----------
remember that you're not crazy


---------71:54----------
so uh okay i misspoke that's what no no


---------71:57----------
no you're all good


---------72:03----------
no that's consider me checkmated no no


---------72:06----------
it's all good um because i was like


---------72:08----------
basically


---------72:09----------
i think things like that like you're


---------72:12----------
right i'm not perfectly happy with how i


---------72:14----------
look but is that is that necessarily a


---------72:15----------
bad thing i feel like that's not


---------72:17----------
that's like a human thing yeah sure but


---------72:20----------
that's why you know enlightenment is not


---------72:21----------
human


---------72:24----------
okay so so is it do a lot of people


---------72:26----------
suffer with it is it


---------72:27----------
acceptable absolutely but i think that


---------72:30----------
you know i personally believe that you


---------72:33----------
should strive for as much happiness as


---------72:35----------
you can in this life


---------72:36----------
yes and that's true i have a lot of


---------72:39----------
happiness


---------72:40----------
yeah so and i'm trying to get


---------72:43----------
so let me let me just say so when you


---------72:46----------
owned your insecurities and you felt


---------72:48----------
that embarrassment that some scar


---------72:50----------
got a little bit smaller


---------72:53----------
yeah definitely i mean i was so insecure


---------72:55----------
with how i looked when i was younger


---------72:57----------
to the point where i remember vividly


---------73:00----------
like


---------73:00----------
my my high school boyfriend came over


---------73:02----------
unannounced


---------73:03----------
i didn't have makeup on and had glasses


---------73:06----------
i got lasik


---------73:07----------
um i glasses i had no makeup on and he


---------73:10----------
rung the doorbell and i opened it and i


---------73:13----------
slammed it in his face because i thought


---------73:14----------
he was gonna break up with me as soon as


---------73:16----------
he saw me


---------73:17----------
because no one could ever love me how i


---------73:19----------
was like that's i remember having that


---------73:20----------
exact thought


---------73:23----------
and then he actually helped a lot


---------73:25----------
because after he was like what you


---------73:26----------
looked fine


---------73:27----------
and i was like huh so that helped a lot


---------73:31----------
it's like a very vivid memory


---------73:34----------
um yeah it sounds like you've grown


---------73:37----------
immensely halfway


---------73:38----------
yeah i think i have i think i'm a really


---------73:40----------
logical person and i


---------73:42----------
treat my self and my own problems the


---------73:45----------
way i treat games


---------73:48----------
and like i said i [ __ ] deserve my


---------73:49----------
gaming success because i'm [ __ ] good


---------73:51----------
at them


---------73:52----------
but um um


---------73:57----------
okay i mean going back to like


---------74:01----------
when i when i was saying like the


---------74:02----------
systematic thing like


---------74:04----------
i don't know i always bring this example


---------74:07----------
up because it's a very


---------74:08----------
jarring one that i think people can


---------74:09----------
understand uh so when i was 17 i was a


---------74:12----------
pro owl player and there was a team that


---------74:14----------
qualified on the tournament realm


---------74:17----------
called gonna rape hafu at regionals


---------74:20----------
and they qualified and nothing was done


---------74:22----------
about their team name


---------74:24----------
and you know that was kind of the


---------74:26----------
attitude of the gaming culture at the


---------74:28----------
time


---------74:30----------
and so like when you look at that


---------74:34----------
how are you supposed to just


---------74:37----------
be okay with that


---------74:42----------
so let me ask you something as you share


---------74:44----------
this story


---------74:46----------
do you s so like as we've talked about


---------74:49----------
particular subjects there have been


---------74:51----------
little volcanoes or big volcanoes that


---------74:52----------
have erupted


---------74:53----------
right do you notice any eruption


---------74:58----------
as you share this story a tiny one


---------75:05----------
quiver here yeah yep so so when you say


---------75:08----------
okay so like let me ask you this if we


---------75:11----------
look at the size of the story


---------75:14----------
and the size of what you're talking


---------75:16----------
about in the outside world that is


---------75:18----------
gigantic right


---------75:21----------
it's huge that's [ __ ] insane


---------75:26----------
it's unjust it's terrible why is there


---------75:29----------
not


---------75:29----------
a volcanic eruption in you because


---------75:32----------
things have gotten better and people are


---------75:34----------
more aware of


---------75:35----------
this kind of attitude and it used to be


---------75:38----------
kind of like


---------75:39----------
the attitude back then was it's expected


---------75:41----------
of you to just suck it up


---------75:43----------
like why are you even complaining that


---------75:45----------
kind of thing it was like a very


---------75:46----------
normalized


---------75:48----------
and so that's what i did okay so so


---------75:52----------
no one ever spoke up against it and like


---------75:54----------
including myself or my teammates or


---------75:56----------
anyone at blizzard you know so what i'm


---------75:58----------
hearing what i'm hearing is that the


---------76:00----------
world has changed and that's why


---------76:02----------
this story doesn't hurt more to tell


---------76:05----------
it's


---------76:06----------
getting better it gives me hope i didn't


---------76:08----------
have hope back then


---------76:09----------
and i have hope that things will


---------76:11----------
continuously get better


---------76:12----------
okay so is hope inside the house or


---------76:14----------
outside the house


---------76:18----------
it's inside i think okay so your


---------76:21----------
question was how are you supposed to be


---------76:23----------
okay with it right


---------76:26----------
yeah yeah i think like how are you so if


---------76:28----------
someone goes through that like


---------76:30----------
how are you supposed to be like that


---------76:32----------
shouldn't affect you right no no


---------76:34----------
hold on yeah but i think we you have the


---------76:36----------
answer i don't actually have the answer


---------76:37----------
you have the answer so let's just map


---------76:39----------
this out so you're saying


---------76:40----------
how are you supposed to be okay with it


---------76:42----------
and my my answer to your question


---------76:45----------
is how are you so okay with it


---------76:48----------
because remember that's a gigantic thing


---------76:50----------
outside of your house


---------76:52----------
but you having lived through that do not


---------76:54----------
have a volcanic eruption


---------76:56----------
you are relatively speaking at peace


---------76:58----------
with it you're relatively speaking you


---------77:00----------
have


---------77:00----------
hope the inside of your house is good


---------77:04----------
despite something so god-awful


---------77:07----------
happening on the outside of the world so


---------77:10----------
how can you have such a gigantic


---------77:12----------
terrible thing as going to a pro


---------77:14----------
tournament and having


---------77:16----------
a team name that is denigr like


---------77:18----------
denigrating offensive


---------77:20----------
and threatening to you and you're just


---------77:23----------
sitting here on stream talking about it


---------77:25----------
um


---------77:26----------
because when it's ancient too like like


---------77:28----------
i said i think


---------77:30----------
um i think the gaming


---------77:34----------
community as a whole has grown a lot


---------77:36----------
since then


---------77:37----------
and just the industry has grown a lot


---------77:39----------
since then and i yeah so i think the


---------77:41----------
reason you're okay with it has


---------77:42----------
nothing to do with that really yes


---------77:47----------
you're leaving one important person out


---------77:48----------
in terms of growth and change


---------77:51----------
gaming industry that's not going to do


---------77:54----------
anything to your suffering


---------77:57----------
what are you doing i'm part of the


---------77:59----------
gaming industry and it makes


---------78:01----------
it gives me hope that you know like i


---------78:03----------
think in another 10 20 years like it's


---------78:06----------
just gradually getting better this is


---------78:07----------
from a decade more than a day so i think


---------78:09----------
hope is reasonable but i still think you


---------78:11----------
asked me the question


---------78:12----------
how are you supposed to be okay with it


---------78:14----------
and i think the same


---------78:15----------
how are you okay with it i think it's


---------78:17----------
because you've grown as a person


---------78:19----------
because you've developed hope hope is


---------78:22----------
inside the house


---------78:23----------
that's how you got to be okay with it so


---------78:25----------
my whole point here hafu is that


---------78:27----------
there's a line between the outside world


---------78:29----------
and the inside world and you're saying


---------78:31----------
how are you supposed to be okay on the


---------78:33----------
inside of your house when


---------78:34----------
the capitol building is on fire in


---------78:36----------
washington dc


---------78:37----------
and that has to do with you how the [ __ ]


---------78:40----------
are you not so traumatized


---------78:42----------
that you quit twitch entirely or quit


---------78:44----------
pro gaming


---------78:45----------
forever when there was a team that


---------78:47----------
showed up in the regional qualifiers


---------78:49----------
that's name was we're gonna rape you how


---------78:51----------
are you able to do that i don't think


---------78:53----------
twitch gets credit for that


---------78:55----------
i don't think the gaming community gets


---------78:56----------
credit for that i think you get credit


---------78:58----------
for it


---------79:01----------
i mean like i said there's no other


---------79:04----------
option


---------79:05----------
the option is to like


---------79:08----------
i still choose to be here i still choose


---------79:10----------
to be in this world


---------79:12----------
that's how you do it yeah that's the


---------79:15----------
only way


---------79:15----------
it's like you can't do anything because


---------79:17----------
these things exist


---------79:18----------
they happen and it's like


---------79:22----------
the only way is to accept like to you


---------79:24----------
know to to be okay with it


---------79:26----------
that's the only way or else i would have


---------79:29----------
had to quit


---------79:30----------
right like that what else could i do


---------79:32----------
that's what i'm saying so you're saying


---------79:34----------
that you


---------79:34----------
like like you're asking how are you


---------79:36----------
learning to be okay with it i think you


---------79:37----------
got


---------79:38----------
halfway there right like you grew as a


---------79:39----------
person like my i feel like


---------79:41----------
i don't know if it sounds to me like


---------79:43----------
you're arguing with me but i feel like


---------79:45----------
we're both saying the same damn thing


---------79:46----------
maybe like i because i everything you're


---------79:50----------
saying


---------79:51----------
doesn't feel to me like it's a point


---------79:53----------
against what i'm saying i feel like it's


---------79:54----------
a point


---------79:55----------
to support what i'm saying because if


---------79:57----------
you really look at it analytically


---------79:59----------
a huge stressor from the outside should


---------80:02----------
correlate


---------80:03----------
with a large emotional response on the


---------80:05----------
inside but if we look at you


---------80:07----------
scientifically what we see


---------80:08----------
is there are gigantic stressors on the


---------80:10----------
outside that lead to tiny little


---------80:12----------
eruptions


---------80:13----------
like a slight quiver in your throat and


---------80:15----------
they're relatively benign questions like


---------80:17----------
when did you


---------80:18----------
learn how to say you shouldn't do that


---------80:19----------
to yourself that lead to huge emotional


---------80:22----------
eruptions


---------80:23----------
ergo minor stressors lead to large


---------80:26----------
things on the inside


---------80:27----------
and big stressors lead to small things


---------80:29----------
on the inside therefore we


---------80:32----------
this is one instance right this is one


---------80:34----------
instance and i don't have to think about


---------80:36----------
it every day whereas the other thing is


---------80:37----------
something to do with like chat which i


---------80:39----------
had to deal with on a daily basis


---------80:42----------
um so that some scar like


---------80:45----------
snowballed like crazy so that's i think


---------80:47----------
that's why it's like a similar vein but


---------80:49----------
it's not like


---------80:50----------
i had that happen to me every day this


---------80:52----------
is one instance


---------80:53----------
that happened and the other one is like


---------80:56----------
on a daily every single day


---------80:58----------
i'm experiencing this well whether a mob


---------81:00----------
on stream or off stream


---------81:01----------
so what i take away what i take away


---------81:03----------
from that is the size of the stressors


---------81:05----------
i'm misnaming


---------81:07----------
right so like there's getting there's


---------81:09----------
getting bitten by a lion


---------81:11----------
once in your life and then there's get


---------81:13----------
getting bit by a dog every [ __ ] day


---------81:16----------
one yeah the dog is going to be far more


---------81:18----------
traumatized absolutely yes


---------81:19----------
so i think that's why yeah well no so so


---------81:23----------
i still think though that


---------81:25----------
i see what you're saying and so i


---------81:26----------
concede that point if we're arguing


---------81:28----------
something


---------81:29----------
but i still think that that doesn't have


---------81:31----------
to be an argument


---------81:33----------
what i still think is fundamental here


---------81:35----------
is that


---------81:37----------
there is some amount of something you


---------81:40----------
can do when something crosses the


---------81:41----------
threshold between the outside world and


---------81:43----------
your house


---------81:45----------
yes and when you ask how are you okay


---------81:48----------
with it you have to study


---------81:50----------
that thing right so like i don't get to


---------81:53----------
choose what life throws my way


---------81:55----------
but i get to choose how i react to it


---------81:58----------
yes


---------82:00----------
that's how you learn to be okay with it


---------82:02----------
right it's these issues of acceptance


---------82:04----------
because


---------82:04----------
like think about 17 year old you and how


---------82:07----------
accepting you were of your appearance


---------82:09----------
and think about 29 year old you and how


---------82:11----------
accepting you are of your appearance


---------82:12----------
i don't think the outside world and in


---------82:15----------
this case the outside world


---------82:16----------
your body has changed drastically


---------82:18----------
between 17 and 29


---------82:20----------
okay right but you your attitude


---------82:24----------
towards it you have become more okay


---------82:25----------
just imagine talking to 17 year old you


---------82:28----------
and how confused 17 year old if you told


---------82:31----------
17 year old you if you went back in time


---------82:33----------
and you told 17 17 year old you was like


---------82:35----------
i'm ugly like no one can ever see me


---------82:36----------
like this and you said


---------82:38----------
actually you're gonna be like relatively


---------82:39----------
okay with your appearance you're never


---------82:40----------
gonna look perfect


---------82:41----------
but you're gonna feel confident in the


---------82:43----------
way you look and then 17 year old you


---------82:45----------
would ask you the same


---------82:46----------
[ __ ] question you're asking me yeah


---------82:48----------
that makes sense


---------82:50----------
so you're saying i have to tackle it in


---------82:51----------
the same way so think about why is it


---------82:53----------
affecting me so much


---------82:55----------
and like um your thing is these things


---------82:59----------
i'm not


---------82:59----------
i'm not except i don't think i can get


---------83:01----------
my mind to accept those things


---------83:03----------
sure well but i think it's like a fair


---------83:05----------
thing to accept


---------83:08----------
yeah okay so so it's not only to do what


---------83:11----------
you've done so far because i think what


---------83:12----------
you've done so far is


---------83:13----------
quite amazing but there are other


---------83:15----------
methods that you just haven't learned


---------83:17----------
yet


---------83:19----------
right so you've managed to increase your


---------83:21----------
acceptance from 17 to 29 about your


---------83:23----------
appearance


---------83:24----------
so you've learned to be okay with


---------83:26----------
something that you one day thought


---------83:28----------
you would never be okay with without


---------83:30----------
something outside of your house changing


---------83:31----------
my point is that the change happens on


---------83:33----------
the inside doesn't happen on the outside


---------83:34----------
as far as i know you didn't get plastic


---------83:36----------
surgery i mean maybe you did not


---------83:38----------
have to answer it you don't like the


---------83:40----------
matter so so just just for clear


---------83:42----------
clarity like nothing has objectively


---------83:44----------
changed but you have changed


---------83:46----------
and all i'm saying to you is that even


---------83:47----------
when it comes to your insecurity about


---------83:49----------
whatever the [ __ ]


---------83:50----------
it is i i mean we can dig into it if you


---------83:52----------
want to


---------83:53----------
that too can change you can come to


---------83:55----------
accept it and you can feel


---------83:57----------
more peace like you do now about your


---------83:59----------
appearance compared to where you were 17


---------84:00----------
years ago


---------84:01----------
that's the process of growth yes


---------84:14----------
hmm


---------84:18----------
i'm trying to think and i'm still kind


---------84:20----------
of fighting just


---------84:21----------
push i know i know you're just push


---------84:24----------
just push okay


---------84:29----------
so you think that because i have


---------84:32----------
not like a vlog eruption but just


---------84:35----------
because


---------84:36----------
i get annoyed by certain comments that


---------84:40----------
those comments actually affects me


---------84:42----------
into okay so


---------84:46----------
a comment like


---------84:49----------
what annoys me i don't want to say it


---------84:51----------
because then they're gonna say it


---------84:53----------
see there's the some scar right you see


---------84:55----------
that well


---------84:57----------
yes have you seen twitch chat you tell


---------84:59----------
them not to do something what are they


---------85:01----------
gonna do they're gonna do it


---------85:03----------
chad no one spam kappa no one spam it


---------85:07----------
and now let's spam it what bothers you


---------85:10----------
hafu


---------85:10----------
if i turn out to be right what bothers


---------85:13----------
you about that why do you have trouble


---------85:15----------
it doesn't bother me i think more so


---------85:17----------
like no it doesn't bother me


---------85:20----------
it's more so like i'm trying to


---------85:23----------
okay i'm trying to think of something


---------85:29----------
um


---------85:33----------
i can't think of something but let's say


---------85:38----------
someone is just


---------85:43----------
someone is just hate watching and just


---------85:44----------
very negative actually it's really cool


---------85:47----------
on twitch you can look at someone's chat


---------85:48----------
messages right and sometimes you see


---------85:51----------
someone i


---------85:52----------
like i see something in chat and


---------85:53----------
sometimes i'm annoyed i've lost a game


---------85:55----------
right


---------85:56----------
i've lost the game i'm in a bad state of


---------85:57----------
mind because i'm salty


---------86:00----------
and i see something criticizing the way


---------86:02----------
i play


---------86:03----------
and i click his messages and i scroll


---------86:05----------
through


---------86:06----------
and every single out of the 200 messages


---------86:09----------
they've wrote


---------86:10----------
is negative in one way or another every


---------86:13----------
single message is meant to tear me down


---------86:16----------
am i justified i'm being annoyed


---------86:19----------
justified absolutely or but it's


---------86:22----------
but you're suggesting the best way to


---------86:24----------
deal with it is to be


---------86:25----------
at home you're saying it's two different


---------86:29----------
things right


---------86:30----------
bro hold on a second this is where the


---------86:33----------
money is okay


---------86:34----------
why do you click on their name well i


---------86:37----------
want to see if i'm


---------86:38----------
being why unreasonable because if


---------86:41----------
they're just a normal person


---------86:43----------
you want to see if you're being


---------86:45----------
unreasonable what's going on in your


---------86:47----------
mind at that moment


---------86:48----------
maybe i'm being a salty [ __ ] i have to


---------86:50----------
see if it's you know me being salty or


---------86:52----------
not


---------86:52----------
no it's not you being salty the reason


---------86:55----------
you look


---------86:56----------
is because maybe they're right


---------87:00----------
yeah cause you're sad i'm sorry that's


---------87:02----------
the [ __ ]


---------87:03----------
[Laughter]


---------87:09----------
so this is really important okay this is


---------87:11----------
really really important


---------87:15----------
why do we go fishing for things that


---------87:18----------
hurt us right i'll give you an example


---------87:21----------
so like let's say i get dumped by my


---------87:23----------
girlfriend i'm feeling bad about myself


---------87:25----------
you said you're feeling salty and then


---------87:27----------
what do i go


---------87:28----------
do when i'm feeling bad about myself at


---------87:30----------
two in the morning after being


---------87:32----------
dumped i got dumped a month ago i log on


---------87:35----------
to instagram or facebook or whatever


---------87:37----------
and i go look at pictures i see one


---------87:39----------
picture of my


---------87:40----------
ex with another dude and then i click on


---------87:43----------
it and i look at all the pictures


---------87:45----------
and i just torture myself i go looking


---------87:48----------
for that hurt


---------87:49----------
why the [ __ ] do we do that as human


---------87:51----------
beings


---------87:54----------
i don't know that's a good question


---------88:00----------
that's relatable absolutely because


---------88:02----------
that's what you're doing on twitch chat


---------88:06----------
well i need to feel justified when i ban


---------88:08----------
their ass you know what i'm saying


---------88:12----------
yeah you need to feel all kinds of you


---------88:14----------
need to feel


---------88:15----------
validated when you click on that you


---------88:18----------
feel


---------88:18----------
validated right and i'll tell you so for


---------88:21----------
the the dude who looks at picture of his


---------88:22----------
pictures of his girlfriend he tells


---------88:24----------
himself i'm a good person


---------88:26----------
but inside he feels unlovable and every


---------88:29----------
single picture that he looks at of


---------88:30----------
another human like


---------88:31----------
another dude with his girlfriend he's


---------88:33----------
like [ __ ]


---------88:35----------
i knew i was unlovable i knew i was


---------88:37----------
unlovable i knew i was unlovable


---------88:40----------
it's validating that's why we torture


---------88:43----------
ourselves


---------88:44----------
because it's not telling yourself


---------88:45----------
because here's the option right like so


---------88:47----------
in that moment when i see my


---------88:48----------
ex-girlfriend with another dude


---------88:50----------
i tell myself oh there are other fish in


---------88:53----------
the sea


---------88:53----------
you should let her go man it's no big


---------88:56----------
deal you're a good looking guy and


---------88:57----------
you're like [ __ ] you


---------88:59----------
that's invalidating i'm gonna go and


---------89:01----------
torture myself because it's how i feel


---------89:03----------
and i want the world to see how i feel i


---------89:06----------
don't want to be alone with those


---------89:07----------
feelings anymore


---------89:08----------
okay even if it hurts sure


---------89:13----------
so you're saying every time i get


---------89:15----------
annoyed at a comment it's my


---------89:17----------
insecurities


---------89:18----------
that they have said something that i


---------89:21----------
think


---------89:22----------
is true is that true though let's say


---------89:25----------
someone calls me


---------89:30----------
okay let's just say someone comes in and


---------89:33----------
says something racist to me


---------89:36----------
okay and i get annoyed and i


---------89:39----------
ban them is that an insecurity thing


---------89:43----------
i don't think so could be


---------89:47----------
so so there's a there's an extreme so


---------89:49----------
there's an extreme way to take this hafu


---------89:51----------
and there's a practical way to take this


---------89:53----------
yeah yeah i'm just trying to understand


---------89:54----------
because i'm trying to think i've been a


---------89:56----------
lot of people


---------89:57----------
let me let me let me let me try to share


---------89:59----------
with you a couple of things because i i


---------90:00----------
think the more philosophical and


---------90:02----------
theoretical this gets i think the less


---------90:04----------
useful it is


---------90:05----------
okay so you can play that game if you


---------90:07----------
want to but here's what i would tell you


---------90:09----------
okay i think that you are an awesome


---------90:11----------
person it's clear to me you've grown a


---------90:13----------
lot i don't really know who you were


---------90:14----------
back then but you clearly


---------90:16----------
come across as someone who is confident


---------90:19----------
in yourself and has grown immensely and


---------90:21----------
has suffered


---------90:22----------
you have the mark of past suffering on


---------90:24----------
you yes


---------90:25----------
i see that very clearly you've gotten to


---------90:28----------
where you are


---------90:29----------
you seem happy you're engaged things are


---------90:31----------
fantastic you sort of talk about being


---------90:33----------
blunt and maybe some


---------90:34----------
other people think you should change


---------90:36----------
that and you tell yourself maybe you


---------90:37----------
should change that but you're actually


---------90:38----------
completely fine with being blunt i am


---------90:40----------
trying to think i know i can tell


---------90:44----------
so like but there's that part of you


---------90:45----------
that's but like you see that too is like


---------90:47----------
where you say oh maybe i shouldn't be


---------90:48----------
that way but you're actually really


---------90:50----------
validating and accepting of yourself


---------90:51----------
there even though


---------90:52----------
that's contrary to the should but that's


---------90:54----------
another separate point i'm with you


---------90:56----------
so right so now here's what i'm


---------90:58----------
proposing to you it's something for you


---------90:59----------
to pick up and play with if you want to


---------91:01----------
okay


---------91:03----------
despite all of your growth despite all


---------91:05----------
of this stuff


---------91:06----------
you're not perfectly happy no right no


---------91:09----------
one is ever perfectly happy


---------91:11----------
unless you're enlightened yep there you


---------91:14----------
go okay


---------91:15----------
so so here's what i perceive in you


---------91:19----------
is that there is still a some scar that


---------91:21----------
is actually quite big


---------91:23----------
which doesn't get triggered very much


---------91:25----------
because you don't see many dogs on the


---------91:27----------
street anymore


---------91:28----------
okay but you're still carrying it around


---------91:32----------
yes and in my experience just like you


---------91:36----------
were carrying a lot


---------91:37----------
around a lot of insecurity when you were


---------91:39----------
17 you're not carrying that [ __ ] around


---------91:41----------
anymore


---------91:42----------
and it feels good it lets you be happy


---------91:46----------
and you say but this isn't that big of a


---------91:48----------
deal because it doesn't affect me every


---------91:50----------
day i get that


---------91:51----------
but i'm telling you hafu generally


---------91:53----------
speaking the closer you get to the top


---------91:55----------
the harder it is to rise


---------91:57----------
it's just like climbing mount everest


---------91:59----------
it's just like the wow ladder


---------92:00----------
you can take whatever it's a universal


---------92:02----------
principle of life


---------92:04----------
i agree and so what i'm offering you


---------92:07----------
by offering i mean i'm proposing a


---------92:09----------
hypothesis that i think you would be


---------92:11----------
happier


---------92:13----------
and maybe this is what you're running up


---------92:14----------
against i think you would be happier if


---------92:16----------
you let this go too


---------92:18----------
that you shouldn't walk around shouldn't


---------92:20----------
[ __ ]


---------92:21----------
that that there is a possibility to walk


---------92:23----------
around without the chip on your shoulder


---------92:27----------
yes and how would you start trying to


---------92:30----------
clear that slump scar


---------92:33----------
so i think we you feel the emotions in


---------92:35----------
the present is the short answer


---------92:37----------
right so i didn't do this with you today


---------92:39----------
because i had a feeling this would be


---------92:41----------
way more fun and i'm glad that we've had


---------92:44----------
this discussion


---------92:45----------
but like basically when you had started


---------92:47----------
crying if i'd asked you more questions


---------92:49----------
about it


---------92:50----------
what we would have done is lift up the


---------92:52----------
rug and start sweeping stuff out


---------92:54----------
right we would like we would validate


---------92:56----------
you we would get you to listen and you


---------92:57----------
would feel like


---------92:58----------
you'd start processing those emotions


---------93:00----------
you'd start digesting it


---------93:01----------
because when we sit with an emotion is


---------93:03----------
when we digest it


---------93:06----------
and this is the difference because like


---------93:07----------
when you were 17 and someone said


---------93:09----------
something hurtful about your appearance


---------93:11----------
one comment would be so overwhelming


---------93:13----------
you'd distract yourself from it you'd


---------93:15----------
sweep it under the rug whatever


---------93:16----------
and it would hurt you whereas now what


---------93:18----------
happens is someone says something dude


---------93:19----------
they're continual insults people are


---------93:21----------
attacking you all the time


---------93:22----------
but as you grow up and as your buddhi


---------93:24----------
which is a part of your mind that helps


---------93:26----------
you digest emotions


---------93:27----------
grows more robust you can process things


---------93:30----------
for yourself so that they never become


---------93:32----------
some scars


---------93:33----------
so when my five-year-old gets bit by a


---------93:34----------
dog she's like terrified of dogs and she


---------93:37----------
has a phobia of dogs when i get bit by a


---------93:39----------
dog


---------93:39----------
i'm like [ __ ] that was still really


---------93:41----------
scary the first second of the emotion is


---------93:43----------
exactly the same


---------93:44----------
but then i walk myself through it i hold


---------93:46----------
my hand and i say wow i'll look like


---------93:48----------
that was dumb


---------93:49----------
like are you okay like oh [ __ ] that was


---------93:50----------
scary maybe you should be more careful


---------93:53----------
next time but i'm like or and then that


---------93:56----------
it doesn't form a some scar but if what


---------93:57----------
i tell myself afterwards how are you so


---------93:59----------
[ __ ] stupid like what's wrong with


---------94:00----------
you you dumbass


---------94:02----------
that'll form a sum scar you see that


---------94:07----------
emotional digestion evoking the feelings


---------94:10----------
and sitting with them


---------94:12----------
when you use the term psychoanalyze i


---------94:14----------
think what you did is work


---------94:15----------
through stuff you didn't analyze it you


---------94:18----------
worked through it there's a big


---------94:19----------
difference


---------94:21----------
that's true you felt those feelings you


---------94:23----------
sat with those feelings and you were


---------94:24----------
your own therapist


---------94:28----------
so all you have to do is just evoke them


---------94:30----------
and this is where


---------94:31----------
i know we've been at this for a while


---------94:32----------
and you say i don't want to


---------94:35----------
like what i'm really getting from you is


---------94:36----------
not an illogical resistance and i


---------94:38----------
genuinely think you're open-minded and


---------94:40----------
trying to understand


---------94:41----------
what i'm getting from you is i don't


---------94:44----------
wanna


---------94:46----------
yeah that's true part of it is i really


---------94:48----------
don't want to because


---------94:49----------
yep and that's not logical right because


---------94:52----------
so you can ask me as many questions


---------94:54----------
about scenarios as you want to that


---------94:55----------
resistance is going to be there


---------94:58----------
yeah can ask whatever you want to you


---------95:01----------
can checkmate as much


---------95:02----------
me as much as you want i can checkmate


---------95:04----------
you as much as i want to


---------95:05----------
it's not going to get anywhere because


---------95:07----------
hafu you don't want to


---------95:14----------
that's cool every time


---------95:20----------
we ban emotionally because they've


---------95:23----------
triggered a sumscar


---------95:26----------
i don't you say ban emotionally


---------95:30----------
yeah yeah i'm just saying it like let's


---------95:32----------
say someone comes in and says something


---------95:34----------
that triggers your sunscreen we ban them


---------95:38----------
i don't think so so i think we ban


---------95:41----------
people


---------95:42----------
for reasons that are not emotional right


---------95:45----------
okay so like action and some scars are


---------95:49----------
different like you can act without a


---------95:50----------
some scar


---------95:51----------
being active in your mind you can ban


---------95:54----------
someone because


---------95:55----------
you can like it doesn't hurt you but


---------95:56----------
you're like this fucker's gotta get


---------95:57----------
banned


---------95:59----------
true there's a certain like chillness to


---------96:01----------
it right that is detachment that is


---------96:03----------
vairagya yeah you're right you're right


---------96:05----------
you're right if someone says something


---------96:06----------
racist


---------96:06----------
i don't personally get effect affected


---------96:09----------
by it like it doesn't


---------96:10----------
exactly feel like that's an attack feel


---------96:12----------
anything i don't feel like and yet


---------96:14----------
you're like they have your motivation to


---------96:15----------
act is still very strong


---------96:18----------
and that this is where people get


---------96:19----------
confused because they think that's true


---------96:21----------
how can you be motivated to act and


---------96:22----------
still be detached because


---------96:24----------
most of us get motivated by our [ __ ]


---------96:26----------
sub scars


---------96:28----------
and what i'm telling you is that's what


---------96:29----------
leads to a train wreck of a life


---------96:32----------
okay yeah that makes sense


---------96:35----------
so whenever i find myself getting


---------96:39----------
triggered the right word yep absolutely


---------96:42----------
okay


---------96:43----------
whenever i find myself getting triggered


---------96:45----------
i need to break down why i feel


---------96:47----------
triggered


---------96:49----------
sure everything yeah or or you can you


---------96:51----------
know get someone to help you with that


---------96:53----------
because like for example like there's a


---------96:55----------
like so let me ask you something hafu


---------96:56----------
i mean i don't think we have time to get


---------96:58----------
into this because i can't keep doing


---------96:59----------
this i'm running out mp at this point


---------97:01----------
okay


---------97:01----------
but why don't you want to


---------97:06----------
scary there it is


---------97:09----------
yeah i mean i know i know i don't want


---------97:11----------
to so we can you can ask me as many


---------97:13----------
questions you want to it's not going to


---------97:14----------
get anywhere


---------97:17----------
so it should be more like every time i


---------97:20----------
have an emotional response


---------97:23----------
then i should figure out why i'm getting


---------97:25----------
that emotional response


---------97:26----------
i so you said every time i have


---------97:28----------
emotional response i should figure out


---------97:29----------
why i'm getting that response i disagree


---------97:31----------
i'd say do it once a week


---------97:34----------
let yourself live the other six days of


---------97:36----------
the week


---------97:37----------
okay yeah


---------97:42----------
that makes sense i will keep that in


---------97:44----------
mind


---------97:45----------
that it's the thing yeah yeah so


---------97:48----------
just to give you an example if i wanted


---------97:51----------
to get you


---------97:52----------
to want to the next question i would ask


---------97:55----------
would be what are you scared of


---------97:58----------
right because there's a some scar


---------97:59----------
there's something you're afraid of


---------98:00----------
that's a fear that's


---------98:02----------
a that's something that's coming up and


---------98:03----------
then we would work through why you don't


---------98:05----------
want to


---------98:06----------
and as we emotionally digest that then


---------98:09----------
you'll be okay doing the next one


---------98:12----------
well part of it is we're doing this live


---------98:15----------
on stream


---------98:16----------
yeah a lot of the trauma is from stream


---------98:19----------
yep it's from chat so you want me to


---------98:22----------
talk through something


---------98:23----------
you want to give the ammo to the thing


---------98:25----------
that traumatized me in the first place


---------98:27----------
so that is why i'm scared of it


---------98:29----------
you know okay like sure uh i've like for


---------98:32----------
the longest time


---------98:33----------
i would stay in my own bubble on twitch


---------98:36----------
i won


---------98:36----------
a global evo many years ago i chose not


---------98:40----------
to ever cash it in


---------98:41----------
because i would be scared that if i did


---------98:43----------
do


---------98:44----------
a picture of myself then it would be


---------98:46----------
used in a negative way


---------98:47----------
like that kind of thing right i would


---------98:49----------
very much stick to my own


---------98:51----------
bubble it was only in the last two years


---------98:53----------
that i have felt comfortable collabing


---------98:55----------
with other people


---------98:56----------
and felt comfortable


---------99:00----------
are you hearing me say that i want to


---------99:03----------
get


---------99:03----------
into that with you yeah oh no


---------99:07----------
yes or no well you're saying that no i'm


---------99:10----------
saying i don't want


---------99:11----------
okay okay right because i'm explaining


---------99:13----------
why because i feel like i know why i


---------99:15----------
don't want to


---------99:16----------
do it i understand i've there's a reason


---------99:19----------
why i didn't push when the sum scar came


---------99:21----------
up right so like for whatever reason


---------99:23----------
i felt really really a lot of resistance


---------99:26----------
from you


---------99:26----------
to explore emotionally so we've just let


---------99:29----------
that [ __ ] slide like that's okay


---------99:31----------
okay i'm just sharing with you


---------99:33----------
intellectually


---------99:34----------
how that would look yes okay


---------99:38----------
right a lot of what you have said mate


---------99:39----------
has made a lot of sense and


---------99:41----------
uh it is pretty enlightening like the um


---------99:46----------
like certain comments affects me in


---------99:49----------
in a different way even if it's negative


---------99:51----------
so that's what i didn't understand but


---------99:53----------
now i do


---------99:54----------
like someone calling me a poopoo head i


---------99:56----------
might not like it but it's not gonna


---------99:57----------
like


---------99:58----------
make me i don't know good


---------100:01----------
so so now this is very cool because


---------100:03----------
you've stumbled upon another


---------100:04----------
halfway you're brilliant okay so you've


---------100:05----------
stumbled upon another really important


---------100:07----------
principle


---------100:08----------
which is pain and pleasure is outside of


---------100:10----------
the axis


---------100:11----------
of suffering and contentment


---------100:15----------
what sorry that went over my head so


---------100:20----------
you can still continue to feel pain and


---------100:22----------
pleasure if you are detached


---------100:25----------
oh okay so pain and pleasure are not on


---------100:29----------
the same axis


---------100:30----------
as attachment and detachment so you can


---------100:32----------
still


---------100:33----------
feel angry you can still get upset about


---------100:35----------
stuff but


---------100:36----------
you don't suffer it's kind of hard to


---------100:38----------
describe but like you said


---------100:40----------
there are two things that can annoy you


---------100:41----------
but the quality of the annoyance is


---------100:43----------
different yes


---------100:44----------
yes right one is deeper and one shot


---------100:46----------
like a surface level yep so so what


---------100:48----------
what the yogis realize is that there's


---------100:51----------
actually two things they're not the same


---------100:54----------
one is on the axis of pain and pleasure


---------100:56----------
which you can never get


---------100:58----------
free of that's always going to happen


---------101:01----------
and then the second


---------101:02----------
is the axis of attachment and detachment


---------101:05----------
or suffering in contentment


---------101:08----------
you know so like i'd say that if i have


---------101:09----------
to go get a covid test and someone


---------101:11----------
sticks a swab


---------101:12----------
like all the way up into my cranium


---------101:14----------
painful yes it's painful


---------101:16----------
but i'm not going to suffer it's like


---------101:18----------
yes


---------101:20----------
so i think you've stumbled upon that i


---------101:21----------
think you're very it's impressive


---------101:24----------
how nuanced you are with understanding


---------101:26----------
your own experiences


---------101:28----------
and so i think you're more i mean you're


---------101:29----------
not wrong about really anything you've


---------101:31----------
said today


---------101:32----------
i just think that there's like another


---------101:33----------
step yeah


---------101:35----------
definitely cool


---------101:39----------
questions um


---------101:42----------
[Music]


---------101:44----------
no i think i i understand your point i


---------101:47----------
think i


---------101:47----------
the thing i was resistant about that i


---------101:49----------
was challenging about


---------101:51----------
i think i understand a lot better um


---------101:56----------
just that you can you're allowed to be


---------101:58----------
annoyed and you're allowed to act on


---------101:59----------
things but it's


---------102:00----------
different than suffering and suffering


---------102:03----------
is like when you internalize it


---------102:04----------
right it's like this um


---------102:08----------
can i ask you when you became less


---------102:11----------
resistant


---------102:13----------
mean during this conversation yeah oh i


---------102:16----------
just didn't understand the concept


---------102:18----------
because before i was like


---------102:19----------
but there are people who are just out


---------102:21----------
there to be rude to you


---------102:22----------
who exist to be rude and i thought that


---------102:25----------
your argument was that it doesn't matter


---------102:29----------
like you should uh


---------102:32----------
like i now i understand that you're


---------102:34----------
saying ban their ass they're being dumb


---------102:36----------
and it's okay to ban them without


---------102:38----------
actually suffering from it


---------102:41----------
when in the course of the conversation


---------102:44----------
did you become more accepting of what i


---------102:46----------
was saying


---------102:48----------
it wasn't that i'm being accepting it's


---------102:50----------
more of like understanding what you're


---------102:51----------
saying


---------102:52----------
when did you understand what i was


---------102:54----------
saying


---------102:56----------
very recently i think was it before or


---------102:59----------
after


---------102:59----------
we talked about your resistance after


---------103:03----------
okay so i was resisting because i


---------103:06----------
genuinely didn't understand and now that


---------103:08----------
i've understood it it's


---------103:10----------
different and now i can so there's a


---------103:12----------
there's there's a differential diagnosis


---------103:14----------
there


---------103:15----------
which is that genuine understanding


---------103:18----------
became more possible


---------103:19----------
once your resistance lowered


---------103:23----------
yeah that's fine so so what i would


---------103:26----------
even i'm not sure but


---------103:30----------
i would say that there's a decent


---------103:32----------
possibility that


---------103:33----------
processing your resistance even for a


---------103:36----------
few minutes because i was bouncing off


---------103:38----------
right


---------103:38----------
i was saying the same [ __ ] for an hour


---------103:40----------
and a half and it kept bouncing off


---------103:42----------
yeah and now suddenly you're like oh


---------103:43----------
like now i understand what you're like


---------103:45----------
what the


---------103:46----------
what the eighth time was a charm


---------103:49----------
i didn't understand it i'm not gonna


---------103:51----------
just accept what you say i never i i


---------103:53----------
know i


---------103:54----------
know i know i know you're not but but


---------103:56----------
what i'm saying is that i like i think


---------103:57----------
it's a really good illustration


---------103:59----------
of how understanding and resistance are


---------104:02----------
tied


---------104:03----------
and when we address the resistance


---------104:05----------
explicitly and sort of talk about that


---------104:07----------
and notice that


---------104:08----------
then the understanding comes more easily


---------104:10----------
yes


---------104:13----------
i agree okay i'm not sure but you know


---------104:16----------
maybe


---------104:16----------
i i do agree i do agree i think it's i


---------104:19----------
was very skeptical


---------104:21----------
skeptical about what you're saying so


---------104:23----------
i'd keep challenging it instead of


---------104:24----------
trying to just


---------104:25----------
understand it and then when i started


---------104:27----------
just trying to understand it i could


---------104:29----------
understand it


---------104:30----------
okay so you're right you're right that's


---------104:33----------
not what i'm saying but i think it's no


---------104:34----------
no no i


---------104:35----------
know i know i know but i'm just saying


---------104:36----------
that you're right that like as soon as


---------104:39----------
i stopped just trying to yeah


---------104:43----------
refute your points yep so so that too is


---------104:45----------
that inside the house or outside the


---------104:46----------
house


---------104:48----------
inside the house yep


---------104:52----------
a lot of stuff is inside the house hafu


---------104:55----------
yeah


---------104:57----------
okay do you meditate


---------105:00----------
no want to learn how to meditate


---------105:03----------
isn't it about thinking about nothing


---------105:06----------
it's more like


---------105:08----------
what is it what's that what's the app


---------105:11----------
there's an app with the british guy


---------105:15----------
i don't know meditation app anyway


---------105:18----------
headspace there we go see they knew


---------105:20----------
headspace


---------105:21----------
and it's like you think you think about


---------105:23----------
your breathing and you think about like


---------105:25----------
oh it's like in yoga they do this but


---------105:27----------
you think about like


---------105:30----------
where your body is like where your foot


---------105:32----------
what your foot is experiencing and


---------105:34----------
you like focus on that stuff i can't


---------105:37----------
meditate i've tried it


---------105:39----------
i know that it's very good but the way


---------105:42----------
that i fall asleep now is i put on


---------105:43----------
audible


---------105:44----------
and then i focus on that and then that


---------105:46----------
puts me to sleep in 10 minutes


---------105:49----------
because then instead of like thinking


---------105:51----------
about my problems or


---------105:52----------
anxieties in the day i think about


---------105:54----------
something that has nothing to do with me


---------105:57----------
and then i fall asleep so it's kind of


---------105:58----------
like meditation i think


---------106:00----------
in a way okay so you shared a lot thank


---------106:03----------
you very much you didn't answer my


---------106:05----------
question


---------106:06----------
oh i didn't no i don't think i know how


---------106:08----------
to actually meditate


---------106:09----------
that's not what i asked i asked do you


---------106:11----------
want to meditate


---------106:12----------
oh sorry i said do you know how to


---------106:15----------
meditate


---------106:17----------
unless maybe maybe i said do you know


---------106:19----------
how to meditate


---------106:20----------
maybe we can go back i was maybe i


---------106:22----------
misspoke there too


---------106:23----------
oh but here's my question do you


---------106:26----------
want to meditate today now


---------106:31----------
okay i'm down


---------106:36----------
i'll ask again i think you answered at


---------106:37----------
that time but i want an honest answer do


---------106:39----------
you want to meditate


---------106:44----------
uh not particularly but i don't i know


---------106:47----------
i'm not against it


---------106:48----------
so instead of saying sure because yeah


---------106:52----------
yep okay so let's think about that okay


---------106:55----------
okay so if you don't want to


---------106:58----------
what are we gonna do we don't have to


---------107:02----------
oh i don't care i'm down for whatever


---------107:07----------
i'm trying to be as open as possible


---------107:12----------
am i open or am i hard to work with be


---------107:15----------
honest


---------107:20----------
oh


---------107:22----------
i would say you're easy to work with and


---------107:24----------
you're closed


---------107:26----------
oh okay interesting i don't think you're


---------107:29----------
very open


---------107:31----------
really no no


---------107:34----------
huh that's the first time i've heard


---------107:37----------
that


---------107:38----------
i've always seen myself as super open


---------107:41----------
but i'm rigid that's interesting


---------107:44----------
i like that that's something that i


---------107:45----------
didn't know about myself


---------107:48----------
right i thought it was super open


---------107:52----------
i think you come across as open but like


---------107:55----------
so you're open


---------107:56----------
you're open with your manner you're open


---------107:58----------
with your dialogue


---------107:59----------
but you're closed in your mind like


---------108:00----------
you're like a [ __ ]


---------108:02----------
so they're like like people aren't gonna


---------108:06----------
people aren't gonna tell you you're


---------108:08----------
wrong why not


---------108:10----------
right like you [ __ ] know what you're


---------108:12----------
talking about


---------108:14----------
i encourage people to tell me when they


---------108:16----------
think i'm wrong


---------108:17----------
yeah i know and i'm open to admitting


---------108:19----------
when i'm wrong when i think i'm actually


---------108:21----------
wrong


---------108:22----------
yep when but so this is the thing but i


---------108:24----------
do have to think i'm wrong yes


---------108:26----------
yeah there see so let's let's just look


---------108:28----------
at like relationship dynamics for a


---------108:30----------
moment right so like this is going to


---------108:31----------
cause problems because like


---------108:32----------
sometimes your partner potentially could


---------108:35----------
think that you're wrong and if you don't


---------108:36----------
agree with them


---------108:37----------
it's going to cause problems but they


---------108:39----------
have their own perspective


---------108:40----------
david and i he's the same way if he


---------108:43----------
doesn't think he's wrong he also won't


---------108:45----------
back down


---------108:46----------
so we've had that once so what i what i


---------108:48----------
really think about closeness is like


---------108:51----------
what real openness is is acknowledging


---------108:53----------
that even if you don't think you're


---------108:55----------
wrong


---------108:56----------
that you could be wrong


---------108:59----------
right because you're not gonna be right


---------109:00----------
all the time anyway that's neither here


---------109:01----------
nor there i think i'm still deciding


---------109:03----------
about so you know sniffing a fair amount


---------109:05----------
of resistance off of you about


---------109:07----------
meditation


---------109:08----------
whether it's a good idea to try to teach


---------109:10----------
you or not


---------109:11----------
oh right because i will be open to it


---------109:14----------
okay okay so then let's teach you


---------109:18----------
something


---------109:19----------
now the question is what to teach you


---------109:24----------
i'm bridgette trying to think


---------109:27----------
i don't think that necessarily because i


---------109:29----------
don't agree with something that i think


---------109:30----------
i'm


---------109:31----------
right it's just i also don't think i'm


---------109:34----------
wrong


---------109:38----------
like i i know so logically i know that


---------109:40----------
cycle


---------109:41----------
like so i think open and closed


---------109:45----------
is like too unsophisticated of language


---------109:48----------
here's what i'd say about you i'd say


---------109:49----------
from a five factor personality


---------109:51----------
assessment


---------109:52----------
i would imagine you to be a high


---------109:54----------
openness low agreeableness


---------109:58----------
okay that's fine right so i think you're


---------110:01----------
open to new experiences you're


---------110:02----------
exploratory and you're willing to hear


---------110:04----------
people out


---------110:05----------
but you're not really flexible with your


---------110:08----------
opinions


---------110:10----------
takes a lot to change your mind yeah


---------110:12----------
there's like other people that are like


---------110:14----------
oh cool like


---------110:15----------
i'll go whichever way the wind is


---------110:17----------
blowing and hoffw's like uh-uh


---------110:19----------
yeah i yes that is


---------110:22----------
that's that's good right so that's open


---------110:25----------
and closed is like unsophisticated high


---------110:26----------
openness low agreeableness


---------110:28----------
yeah i'm the same way for what it's


---------110:30----------
worth yeah it's very accurate


---------110:33----------
people think i'm really really open but


---------110:35----------
i'm really [ __ ] judgmental in here


---------110:38----------
oh that's one thing that i really liked


---------110:41----------
about myself


---------110:42----------
that i changed well i really didn't like


---------110:44----------
how judgmental i was


---------110:45----------
and my inside the voice in my head


---------110:49----------
was so judgmental and so like mean


---------110:52----------
and then i would filter those mean


---------110:54----------
thoughts like why am i thinking this way


---------110:55----------
why am i judging this way


---------110:57----------
and i would always challenge myself and


---------110:58----------
now my thoughts are very pleasant


---------111:00----------
until i'm pmsing and then i turn to the


---------111:02----------
devil


---------111:04----------
sounds about right that's the only time


---------111:06----------
where my thoughts are rude


---------111:07----------
my thoughts are very nice they're very


---------111:09----------
pleasant because i i cut out all the


---------111:11----------
mean thoughts


---------111:12----------
but then hormones are a [ __ ] like what


---------111:14----------
are you gonna do and that's not my fault


---------111:16----------
yeah that's not my fault so it's


---------111:20----------
yeah so let's think about meditation so


---------111:22----------
now i'm curious about what am i going to


---------111:24----------
teach you


---------111:38----------
ah i've got a good one okay okay so we


---------111:40----------
haven't done this in a little while but


---------111:42----------
so


---------111:47----------
so there are two kinds a lot of


---------111:49----------
different ways to slice up meditation


---------111:51----------
so what i'm going to do hafu is give you


---------111:53----------
a meditation technique


---------111:54----------
it may work for you may not work for you


---------111:56----------
no big deal but


---------111:57----------
when people say you know i'm not good at


---------111:59----------
meditating it generally means that


---------112:01----------
they just haven't been given the right


---------112:03----------
kind of technique for their mind


---------112:05----------
okay so you're someone who's like sort


---------112:07----------
of skeptical


---------112:08----------
doesn't want to be told anything you


---------112:10----------
need to figure things out for yourself


---------112:13----------
and you're also very like introspective


---------112:15----------
so i'm going to give you like


---------112:19----------
okay we're going to give you


---------112:21----------
[Music]


---------112:22----------
what i would call an investigative


---------112:24----------
technique so what we're going to do and


---------112:26----------
by the way i think listening to audible


---------112:27----------
is like a good example of meditation i


---------112:29----------
think you're actually


---------112:30----------
a born meditator you just have to be


---------112:33----------
doing it


---------112:33----------
you have to be given the right kind of


---------112:35----------
technique for your cognitive


---------112:37----------
style when you close your eyes and sit


---------112:39----------
up straight


---------112:41----------
twitch chat can do it too okay back


---------112:43----------
should be straight neck should be


---------112:45----------
straight


---------112:46----------
and i want you to take a breath through


---------112:48----------
your nose


---------112:49----------
breathe in and out


---------112:52----------
and tell me where do you feel the breath


---------112:57----------
mean like


---------112:58----------
my own breath or yep like where is it


---------113:01----------
coming from inside or outside


---------113:04----------
either i mean i can feel my breath on my


---------113:08----------
hands


---------113:09----------
okay and i can feel it going in and out


---------113:11----------
of my chest


---------113:12----------
okay so what does it feel like in your


---------113:16----------
chest


---------113:22----------
nothing okay can you feel something


---------113:26----------
there


---------113:33----------
not really other than my lungs expanding


---------113:35----------
okay so that's something


---------113:36----------
right so you can feel your lungs


---------113:38----------
expanding so you feel a sensation there


---------113:40----------
now let me ask you something do you feel


---------113:42----------
the breath do you feel


---------113:44----------
only your lungs expanding or do you also


---------113:46----------
feel the breath


---------113:50----------
i feel my bra tightening once i inhale


---------113:52----------
because right


---------113:53----------
okay so i want you to pay attention to


---------113:56----------
your nose


---------113:57----------
okay is there breath there


---------114:03----------
yeah i can feel it like through my


---------114:05----------
nostrils okay


---------114:06----------
coming out and now i want you to follow


---------114:09----------
it see where it goes as you breathe in


---------114:15----------
to my sinuses okay keep following see


---------114:19----------
where it goes


---------114:19----------
follow it investigate


---------114:26----------
and then it goes in through my nostrils


---------114:28----------
to my sinus and then it goes


---------114:30----------
through my nostrils to my hands


---------114:34----------
that's that's that right help me


---------114:37----------
understand when you say it goes through


---------114:38----------
your sinuses


---------114:40----------
into your hands well


---------114:43----------
i can feel it because my nose is here


---------114:45----------
and my hands are


---------114:46----------
in my life okay so so what i'm talking


---------114:48----------
about is feeling the sensation on the


---------114:50----------
inside


---------114:51----------
so what i'm hearing you say is the


---------114:52----------
exhalation you can feel on your hands


---------114:55----------
okay is that correct yes


---------114:59----------
but follow the inhalation


---------115:07----------
pay attention to your throat okay


---------115:13----------
can you feel the breath in your throat


---------115:16----------
my throat expands


---------115:18----------
do you feel the expansion or do you feel


---------115:20----------
the same quality that you feel in your


---------115:22----------
nose and your sinuses


---------115:25----------
what do you mean quality so so you're


---------115:28----------
describing musculature


---------115:31----------
when you say my chest is expanding my


---------115:34----------
throat is expanding


---------115:36----------
but i would imagine that the feeling


---------115:40----------
in your throat of expansion in your


---------115:42----------
physical body


---------115:43----------
is different from what you feel in your


---------115:45----------
sinuses


---------115:50----------
is it


---------115:53----------
okay so


---------115:57----------
follow head up straight okay


---------116:00----------
now follow the breath into your throat


---------116:06----------
and see if you can differentiate between


---------116:08----------
the musculature of the throat


---------116:14----------
and the sensation that you feel in your


---------116:16----------
sinuses going back into your throat


---------116:25----------
i don't understand okay


---------116:29----------
so so i think you


---------116:32----------
you're doing it fine by the way so okay


---------116:37----------
so you notice a sensation of breath you


---------116:39----------
may notice the temperature of the breath


---------116:43----------
what is the temperature of the breath


---------116:46----------
where do you feel the coldness in your


---------116:48----------
body when you breathe in


---------116:49----------
how far does it go it goes to my sinuses


---------116:53----------
it's like almost uncomfortable


---------116:57----------
okay so you don't feel coldness in your


---------117:00----------
throat


---------117:02----------
okay that's fine so


---------117:06----------
when you are doing this so i want you to


---------117:08----------
focus on your sinuses for a second you


---------117:10----------
say it feels uncomfortable right so


---------117:12----------
focus on that sensation of discomfort


---------117:18----------
it's like i ate too much wasabi okay


---------117:28----------
okay so now i'm going to give you


---------117:31----------
a separate practice i want you to catch


---------117:35----------
the moment


---------117:36----------
when inhalation becomes exhalation


---------117:54----------
what about that moment have you found it


---------117:59----------
tell me about it


---------118:02----------
it's like at the top of okay


---------118:08----------
just everything stops for a sec okay


---------118:12----------
so are you holding your breath


---------118:16----------
yes for like a split


---------118:21----------
good so normally when you breathe in and


---------118:23----------
you breathe out you don't hold your


---------118:25----------
breath right


---------118:27----------
so i want you to stop holding your


---------118:28----------
breath and find the moment in between


---------118:31----------
inhalation and exhalation


---------118:44----------
what am i looking for just find the


---------118:47----------
moment between


---------118:48----------
in inhalation and exhalation


---------118:53----------
without holding your breath


---------118:58----------
i know i found it so what am i looking


---------119:02----------
okay so if you can find it without


---------119:04----------
holding your breath i want you to sit


---------119:06----------
in that space


---------119:09----------
what


---------119:12----------
what do you mean sit in this okay


---------119:16----------
this is helpful let me think for a


---------119:19----------
second


---------119:27----------
you can open your eyes


---------119:32----------
what oh just uh


---------119:36----------
i don't know close my eyes for a while


---------119:40----------
does the world look different yeah but


---------119:43----------
that's normal


---------119:44----------
right i don't know does that usually


---------119:46----------
happen when you close your eyes


---------119:49----------
no it feels like everything's a lot more


---------119:51----------
clear


---------119:53----------
maybe you just meditated


---------119:58----------
so it's meditation is


---------120:03----------
thinking about


---------120:06----------
less right kind of like decluttering


---------120:08----------
your mind


---------120:11----------
no no so it's not thinking at all


---------120:16----------
so focus and thought are two different


---------120:18----------
things


---------120:21----------
meditation is focused to the exclusion


---------120:24----------
of thought


---------120:24----------
which is something you figured out with


---------120:26----------
audible because you focus the attention


---------120:28----------
of your mind on an audio book


---------120:31----------
and then your mind shuts down and you


---------120:34----------
fall asleep


---------120:35----------
yes so what i i actually don't think


---------120:38----------
these are the right techniques for you i


---------120:39----------
think there are other techniques that


---------120:40----------
are going to be better


---------120:41----------
but i think you did a good job and you


---------120:44----------
can continue to use these techniques


---------120:46----------
so my thought was that if i tell you to


---------120:50----------
do


---------120:50----------
i have to give your mind something


---------120:53----------
because like i don't know how to


---------120:55----------
put this but when i tell you to find the


---------120:57----------
in between space


---------120:59----------
all of your attention is zoomed in


---------121:02----------
on one thing and you're not thinking


---------121:04----------
about anything


---------121:06----------
you're like listening right so like all


---------121:09----------
of your attention is like


---------121:10----------
concentrated into a point yes it's like


---------121:14----------
focusing on the experience yep


---------121:17----------
and so there's no thought there yeah


---------121:20----------
the thought was actually interrupting


---------121:22----------
you because you were like am i doing it


---------121:24----------
right


---------121:24----------
that's yeah yeah yeah right so the more


---------121:27----------
that you got away from that


---------121:29----------
so i i would just so sometimes for


---------121:32----------
people


---------121:32----------
like you what i recommend is meditation


---------121:36----------
that is a question


---------121:37----------
instead of a practice so


---------121:40----------
i'm going to tell you for example that


---------121:42----------
your breath


---------121:44----------
travels further than your sinuses in


---------121:47----------
your nose


---------121:49----------
right and if you focus on it you can


---------121:52----------
feel it in your throat


---------121:54----------
that cool sensation that feels almost


---------121:57----------
painful


---------121:58----------
which what the [ __ ] got there different


---------122:00----------
day


---------122:01----------
but you know who knew that breathing


---------122:03----------
clearly was painful


---------122:04----------
um and and so if you follow that


---------122:07----------
coldness it'll go into your throat and


---------122:08----------
if you follow it


---------122:09----------
see where it goes because i think for


---------122:12----------
someone who's inquisitive and doesn't


---------122:14----------
take like if i tell you to


---------122:15----------
you know do something you're gonna be


---------122:16----------
like what the [ __ ] am i doing this for


---------122:18----------
yeah right so so i have to give you


---------122:21----------
something that's going to engage your


---------122:22----------
mind and keep you curious


---------122:24----------
oddly enough i think that your mind is


---------122:25----------
actually very concrete so when i ask you


---------122:28----------
abstract questions like sit in between


---------122:30----------
the space between


---------122:31----------
inhalation and exhalation i know this


---------122:33----------
sounds weird some people understand what


---------122:34----------
the [ __ ] i'm talking about but you're


---------122:36----------
like what is that


---------122:37----------
i don't know you know which is totally


---------122:40----------
fine so so


---------122:41----------
you know if i give a chance if i get a


---------122:43----------
chance to teach you a different


---------122:44----------
technique of meditation i'm going to


---------122:45----------
have to


---------122:46----------
adapt for that and and do something very


---------122:48----------
good but i didn't need to say


---------122:49----------
audible it's kind of like meditation yep


---------122:52----------
it is because what you're doing is


---------122:53----------
you're focusing your mind it's a dharma


---------122:55----------
yeah


---------122:56----------
yeah it's it's nice yep but i i


---------123:00----------
i don't know if you i don't know if


---------123:02----------
audible will give you the clarity of


---------123:03----------
vision


---------123:04----------
and the crystal clearness of the world


---------123:06----------
afterward


---------123:07----------
yeah who cares i'm asleep that's great


---------123:10----------
it's going to put you to sleep


---------123:11----------
i should be right to sleep so if you do


---------123:14----------
these kinds of techniques i would say


---------123:16----------
you know try to explore and see what the


---------123:18----------
[ __ ] i mean


---------123:19----------
when i say sit in the space between


---------123:22----------
inhalation and exhalation


---------123:23----------
without holding your breath and if you


---------123:27----------
spend a few minutes


---------123:28----------
doing that a couple times a day you can


---------123:30----------
alternate between the two because i


---------123:32----------
imagine you're going to get bored of one


---------123:34----------
quickly


---------123:35----------
why is meditation good


---------123:39----------
uh because it gives us time outside of


---------123:41----------
our mind


---------123:43----------
why do we need that because our mind is


---------123:46----------
the source of our suffering


---------123:48----------
oh okay that's fair


---------123:53----------
see sometimes ask super challenging like


---------123:56----------
oh like


---------123:57----------
what is the purpose of that it's


---------123:58----------
actually pretty simple for rigid


---------124:00----------
concrete people like us it's like that


---------124:02----------
simple


---------124:03----------
yeah if you tell them because tell me


---------124:05----------
why don't you go like watch some


---------124:06----------
youtube lecture on youtube video and the


---------124:09----------
like


---------124:10----------
and they'll you ask why should we


---------124:11----------
meditate some guy's gonna give you some


---------124:12----------
[ __ ] profound answer about


---------124:14----------
yeah inner peace and it's like that's


---------124:16----------
how they make money you need the video


---------124:18----------
to be at least 10 minutes


---------124:19----------
no yeah it's just very simple spend time


---------124:22----------
outside of your mind because the mind is


---------124:23----------
the origin of all of your suffering


---------124:29----------
cool cool


---------124:32----------
um questions or thoughts before you wrap


---------124:34----------
up


---------124:37----------
no this is good this is good i called


---------124:40----------
that i was gonna cry


---------124:41----------
i did cry but i feel good and um


---------124:45----------
thank you for challenging me thank you


---------124:48----------
for challenging me


---------124:51----------
i found that i'm rigid


---------124:54----------
that's not new to you though it is


---------124:58----------
really well frigid isn't the term i


---------125:01----------
would use for myself


---------125:02----------
but now you're right not agreeable yep


---------125:06----------
yep but i don't think it's more it's not


---------125:11----------
i don't think it's necessarily a bad


---------125:12----------
thing it's not


---------125:15----------
i don't think it's a bad thing at all


---------125:18----------
yeah


---------125:18----------
okay well thanks a lot hafu thank you


---------125:21----------
thank you so much for having me i'm glad


---------125:23----------
