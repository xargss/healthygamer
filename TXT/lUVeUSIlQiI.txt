---------00:00----------
so can we just start by doing


---------00:01----------
introductions again sounds good to me


---------00:06----------
you're gonna start off Richard yeah sure


---------00:10----------
so my name is Richard I was on the


---------00:13----------
previous stream so I was going strong


---------00:16----------
for about ten days and unfortunately


---------00:19----------
I've relapse yesterday was which I was


---------00:22----------
pretty bummed about maybe we can talk


---------00:24----------
about that today and it's it was kind of


---------00:27----------
I don't know I I was pretty visibly


---------00:29----------
upset with myself because I thought of


---------00:32----------
this great opportunity to come on stream


---------00:34----------
and you know kind of talk about porn


---------00:38----------
addiction and I thought like I tried to


---------00:40----------
kind of rearrange it in my head to where


---------00:43----------
like I changed it from like a self


---------00:46----------
devoted interest to stop watching porn


---------00:48----------
into like kind of like a group Dharma


---------00:50----------
kind of thing I kind of made it like my


---------00:53----------
responsibility to kind of step up and


---------00:55----------
quit this addiction for like everyone


---------00:58----------
watching and to show everyone that's


---------01:00----------
possible and I was I was kind of hurt


---------01:03----------
when I figured out you know I'm only


---------01:06----------
human and I just really left so I don't


---------01:10----------
know maybe we can get into that and some


---------01:13----------
of the people were able to go strong the


---------01:15----------
whole time so I'm interested to hear


---------01:18----------
their kind of techniques and how they


---------01:19----------
did that so yeah so welcome back Richard


---------01:23----------
thank you


---------01:26----------
who wants to go next


---------01:28----------
I guess I'll go next


---------01:32----------
oh my name is bear and I'm new to the


---------01:36----------
stream yeah welcome bear thank you it's


---------01:39----------
a pleasure to be here it's an honor so I


---------01:42----------
watched the first stream and I couldn't


---------01:46----------
relate because I again to little


---------01:50----------
periodic episodes where I get into


---------01:51----------
analysis paralysis okay and I ended up


---------01:55----------
turning to masturbation and gaming to


---------01:58----------
kind of like


---------02:00----------
work my way through


---------02:02----------
okay rather than it just being like


---------02:06----------
trauma yes okay so you said that you had


---------02:09----------
difficulty relating and you feel like


---------02:12----------
masturbation for you is is like tied up


---------02:15----------
to like other other sort of cognitive


---------02:20----------
things as opposed to some kind of trauma


---------02:22----------
yes


---------02:23----------
okay okay so we can definitely talk


---------02:25----------
about that thanks for coming on man also


---------02:29----------
huge props to you know your gigantic


---------02:32----------
balls for showing your face on a stream


---------02:34----------

---------02:39----------
I think I think we're all nervous who's


---------02:42----------
nervous show hands okay so who else


---------02:47----------

---------02:49----------
themselves the cat in the corner you


---------02:57----------

---------03:03----------
go I guess go for us I'm ghosts probably


---------03:07----------

---------03:09----------
glad to be back I think this will be


---------03:13----------
interesting


---------03:14----------
yeah I hope so


---------03:20----------
I'm Erin I was also on the live stream


---------03:23----------
and I guess I hope that we get to cover


---------03:29----------
some extra bits that we didn't get to


---------03:31----------
last stream absolutely anything in


---------03:34----------
particular that I think you want to talk


---------03:35----------
about today um I'd like to just like


---------03:42----------
first maybe catch up and reiterate on


---------03:46----------
briefly reiterate on so many things that


---------03:48----------
we touched on last time sure then maybe


---------03:50----------
a little bit more on like specifically


---------03:52----------
relationships okay that's great we did


---------03:56----------
gorge on relationships at all that's a


---------03:58----------
good idea yeah yeah okay a fantastic


---------04:01----------
idea great suggestions there and so I


---------04:03----------
think we have one other person in the


---------04:05----------
chat


---------04:08----------
do you want to introduce yourself


---------04:10----------
Tony X Tony Communications mic issues


---------04:18----------
okay oh all right so we'll see if if we


---------04:23----------
can get Tony to rejoin okay so um so I


---------04:26----------
think all fantastic ideas Aaron do you


---------04:29----------
want to just start by use kind of


---------04:31----------
mentioned that you wanted to reiterate a


---------04:32----------
couple of things do you want to just


---------04:33----------
take a stab at that what would you what


---------04:37----------
do you think it's important to reiterate


---------04:39----------
um I think it's just because yeah this


---------04:47----------
past week since the last dream I tried


---------04:52----------
once again to quit the yes resist the


---------04:57----------
addiction and I tried a different


---------05:00----------
approach this time where I just like


---------05:03----------
Richard said instead of focusing on


---------05:05----------
myself and the benefits that would get


---------05:06----------
to myself I thought more about the


---------05:09----------
others that uh we talked with before and


---------05:14----------
everyone that has been like sending


---------05:16----------
messages through the discord or the


---------05:18----------
twitch chat saying how much it helped


---------05:19----------
them how much they could relate to it or


---------05:21----------
maybe they had some other issue like


---------05:24----------
there and there's just more like that


---------05:28----------
companionship that sort of bond hanging


---------05:33----------
on to that almost like it was almost


---------05:36----------
like gripping on to a log while flowing


---------05:39----------
down a river and the river is like the


---------05:43----------
urge is just continually splashing on


---------05:45----------
you go as long as you have that float


---------05:47----------
you can sort of barely stay above the


---------05:50----------
surface until you get to dry land


---------05:53----------
that's actually some really scary


---------05:55----------
imagery I mean because I you know it's


---------06:01----------
not it's not like a life raft it's like


---------06:03----------
a log right it's so unstable the river


---------06:08----------
is just pounding you and it's kind of


---------06:11----------
like you're holding out and I'm not even


---------06:13----------
sure that success is guaranteed at the


---------06:15----------
end like that sounds like you know


---------06:17----------
failure is more inevitable than success


---------06:21----------
is that how it feels to you oh yeah yeah


---------06:25----------
for sure


---------06:26----------
I'm expecting relapse at some point or


---------06:30----------
another just because it's happened to me


---------06:31----------
so many times because I've tried


---------06:32----------
sometimes over the years but I'm going


---------06:36----------
to give it a very strong effort this


---------06:38----------
time and now that I have like being more


---------06:41----------
open about it and having like


---------06:42----------
companionship with it it's made it a


---------06:44----------
little bit easier but it's still of


---------06:46----------
course extremely extremely challenging


---------06:48----------
yeah so I'd like to just offer up


---------06:51----------
another topic for discussion well I mean


---------06:53----------
when I say another I mean I think


---------06:55----------
Richard sort of mentioned this already


---------06:56----------
but I think we should really talk about


---------06:59----------
this idea of relapse and quitting and


---------07:02----------
and you know what is it what is our goal


---------07:05----------
here and what does it mean to have these


---------07:09----------
expectations for yourself and now that


---------07:11----------
you're sort of putting is Richard kind


---------07:15----------
of mentioned you know there's sort of a


---------07:16----------
group Dharma here so like your success


---------07:18----------
or failure no longer just depends on you


---------07:20----------
because people are this is gonna sound


---------07:22----------
bizarre so that this dream is gonna be


---------07:24----------
full of like things that can be taken


---------07:26----------
out of context so people are watching


---------07:28----------
you not fapping right let's go people


---------07:34----------
people are watching you and now you have


---------07:37----------
an expectation to fulfill towards like


---------07:41----------
other people to kind of inspire them and


---------07:43----------
I think so I'd like to talk about that


---------07:46----------
and just what kind of pressure that puts


---------07:49----------
on you what kind of pressure relapse


---------07:51----------
puts on you what kind of pressure the


---------07:53----------
inevitability of relapse puts on you how


---------07:55----------
that pressure actually affects you


---------07:57----------
cognitively and does that actually like


---------07:59----------
you know how does that affect how does


---------08:01----------
the pressure of possibly relapsing


---------08:03----------
affect you relapsing or not relapsing


---------08:08----------
Richard um yeah I I kind of want to take


---------08:13----------
it on like I really want to put it on to


---------08:15----------
myself and because I want to get rid of


---------08:19----------
this and I'd love to have the support of


---------08:21----------
everyone here and everyone watching and


---------08:23----------
I know I do it's just it's it's just


---------08:27----------
difficult and but I want to take that on


---------08:30----------
I just I kind of like almost like in a


---------08:32----------
superhero sense like yeah take take it


---------08:36----------
on and like give it everything I can try


---------08:39----------
like just die trying I don't that just


---------08:42----------
seems so admirable to me and I'd love to


---------08:44----------
be a part of that but there's also you


---------08:47----------
know if like relapse comes then it just


---------08:50----------
like it comes to this point where it's


---------08:51----------
like oh Jesus Christ the superhero kind


---------08:54----------
of like failed the world he wasn't able


---------08:57----------
to save the world which is kind of scary


---------08:59----------
but at the same time I want to take it


---------09:02----------
on and that's kind of what I signed up


---------09:04----------
for joining the stream so I'm I'm ready


---------09:08----------
for it it's just the the stakes are


---------09:11----------
higher now yeah so how so the everyone's


---------09:18----------
counting on me


---------09:19----------
everyone's counting on me to do that so


---------09:23----------
let's talk about being a superhero okay


---------09:27----------
what help me understand or help us


---------09:30----------
understand and you know anyone can jump


---------09:32----------
in by the way it sort of it resonates


---------09:37----------
with me that Richard is kind of talking


---------09:39----------
about doing something superhuman right


---------09:41----------
like there's like there's like a part of


---------09:43----------
us that strives to like overcome and


---------09:45----------
achieve and be greater than what we are


---------09:47----------
and is that does that like does the idea


---------09:51----------
of becoming a superhero like no fat man


---------09:54----------
you know yeah yeah yeah that superhero


---------09:59----------
it's actually funny because my Dischord


---------10:01----------
name is Oh Superman so I've always been


---------10:04----------
a fan of Superman


---------10:06----------
being able to like just achieve great


---------10:08----------
things so uh how are you gonna come to


---------10:11----------
this idea that like I'm only human and I


---------10:15----------
can't be a superhero or like I don't


---------10:18----------
know what would I get am I putting


---------10:21----------
my expectations too high for myself


---------10:23----------
being like trying to strive for


---------10:27----------
like a superhero istic goal why don't


---------10:30----------
you ask your colleagues what do you guys


---------10:31----------
think what do y'all think about becoming


---------10:33----------
a superhero and is Richard putting too


---------10:37----------
high of an expectation on himself I


---------10:39----------
think it's a lot of pressure I think


---------10:44----------
it's a double-edged sword yeah going


---------10:53----------
yeah it's a fine line to walk because


---------10:56----------
the more pressure you put on yourself


---------11:00----------
when or if you do crack it or to


---------11:06----------
continue forward because you're gonna


---------11:07----------
fall that much farther so yeah we are


---------11:14----------
under a lot of pressure taking this on


---------11:17----------
and it's scary but it is at the same


---------11:20----------
time the pressure facing that pressure I


---------11:21----------
can see what you mean by like it's


---------11:23----------
almost uplifting and that when you do


---------11:26----------
triumph over like a really bad day where


---------11:29----------
your urges are like intense and you just


---------11:32----------
barely manage to make it through it's


---------11:34----------
very empowering and so it's it's kind of


---------11:39----------
difficult to navigate that fine line of


---------11:41----------
like not putting too much pressure on


---------11:43----------
yourself to where you can still like


---------11:44----------
function but you still want to like not


---------11:48----------
just given all the way what did you mean


---------11:52----------
by double-edged sword ghosts I meant


---------11:57----------
that it's in a sense can be seen as a


---------12:00----------
positive because the so of group dynamic


---------12:04----------
means that people are relying on you so


---------12:07----------
you feel like there's some element of


---------12:09----------
obligation it reminds me of what you


---------12:11----------
said about Dharma and it's hard to clean


---------12:13----------
your own room but when someone else


---------12:16----------
needs their own cleaned you can do at


---------12:17----------
the drop of a hat


---------12:18----------
it's like it's kind of in a sense easier


---------12:22----------
when there are people counting on you


---------12:24----------
but also there is that overwhelming


---------12:27----------
pressure that makes it more difficult


---------12:31----------
what do you think about what they have


---------12:33----------
to say Richard uh matches yeah I would


---------12:38----------
agree with them no you said something


---------12:40----------
you kind of like sort of tried to put


---------12:43----------
yourself in my shoes for a moment you


---------12:44----------
said are you gonna say something like


---------12:46----------
we're all just normal human like do you


---------12:48----------
remember you made those defensive


---------12:52----------
deflective statement yeah what was that


---------12:54----------
statement let's let's understand that


---------12:56----------
for a second do you got you guys all


---------12:57----------
heard that yeah I don't know I guess we


---------13:04----------
can kind of go into my dad sets really


---------13:07----------
high expectations I


---------13:10----------
he really has a big relationship with


---------13:15----------
word and if I say something I got to do


---------13:18----------
it and and I've always had you know


---------13:21----------
motivation problems sometimes when I say


---------13:25----------
I'm gonna you know an example would be


---------13:28----------
like if I say I'm gonna paint the garage


---------13:30----------
and I paint the garage but I don't


---------13:32----------
complete it all the way by the time I


---------13:34----------
said I was gonna do it there's just like


---------13:37----------
a big disconnect there's I just get a


---------13:40----------
lot of flack from him for that he just


---------13:42----------
doesn't like it mm-hmm


---------13:44----------
and and when you fail after ten days


---------13:47----------
what do you get from yourself


---------13:50----------
um just disappointment you get a lot of


---------13:54----------
flack from yourself a lot of [ __ ] yeah


---------13:57----------
where do you think you learned how to do


---------13:59----------
that


---------14:00----------
it's gotta come from them right like


---------14:05----------
think about that for a second so when we


---------14:08----------
beat ourselves up and I'm sure you guys


---------14:11----------
a beat yourselves up how do you let's


---------14:13----------
talk about that like how do you beat


---------14:15----------
yourself up


---------14:16----------
I caught a grin from bear well I like to


---------14:24----------
get stuck in my own head so that's a


---------14:27----------
really big thing for me and my conduct


---------14:30----------
coping mechanism I guess would be


---------14:33----------
masturbation and you know video games or


---------14:36----------
just trying to find something to to


---------14:38----------
clear my head and what happens when you


---------14:41----------
get stuck in your own head I get this


---------14:46----------
feeling of being really overwhelmed and


---------14:48----------
just don't really know what to do with


---------14:50----------
my I guess what is it that overwhelms


---------14:55----------
you ah just general thoughts I guess


---------15:01----------
more recently I've been in the Nene


---------15:05----------
stage since I just graduated and


---------15:09----------
graduations I'm graduating thank you you


---------15:12----------
thank you better than drop it out it's


---------15:18----------
easier yourself up for graduating and


---------15:20----------
then you know not having a job or


---------15:21----------
whatever but then like it's also easy to


---------15:23----------
just forget that you at least you


---------15:26----------
graduated but a lot of people actually


---------15:27----------
don't that's true that's true I also


---------15:30----------
have like a lot of pressure from my


---------15:32----------
friends and my family for for not being


---------15:35----------
where I should be I'm like I'm a little


---------15:39----------
behind in terms of my age versus


---------15:41----------
graduation than jobs and and all that


---------15:44----------
yeah okay I saw I saw that Tony managed


---------15:50----------
to connect but it seems that he is fled


---------15:52----------
so maybe if we if we can catch him we'll


---------15:55----------
give him a chance to introduce himself


---------15:57----------
it's how we going to get an evil cap so


---------16:03----------
I want to just pause for a second


---------16:05----------
because I have a feeling that we could


---------16:08----------
be talking about a lot of things that


---------16:09----------
don't relate to porn addiction I think


---------16:14----------
what you guys are talking about we could


---------16:15----------
sort of take things in a slightly


---------16:16----------
different direction so I'll just sort of


---------16:18----------
mention a couple of themes that I'm


---------16:20----------
hearing right so the the need the want


---------16:23----------
to be great sort of the need to be great


---------16:27----------
and I think that has something to do


---------16:29----------
with the sense of you know only a soup


---------16:31----------
because because when you guys are when I


---------16:33----------
imagine the image that Aaron was


---------16:36----------
describing which is like you know you're


---------16:37----------
hanging on to a log in a rushing river


---------16:40----------
and you know like you're barely staying


---------16:44----------
afloat and you're you're gonna drown


---------16:45----------
like when I think about that scenario I


---------16:48----------
don't think a normal human can fix that


---------16:51----------
right I think you have to be a superhero


---------16:53----------
to fix that and I think part of sort of


---------16:56----------
the call to be a superheroes because of


---------16:58----------
our perception about how insurmountable


---------17:00----------
our problems are like it feels super


---------17:02----------
like when I think about how like how is


---------17:04----------
Aaron gonna get saved like literally


---------17:06----------
Superman is gonna fly out of the sky and


---------17:08----------
like scoop him out of the walk that's


---------17:10----------
what's gonna happen right that's that's


---------17:11----------
how he gets it because there's a


---------17:13----------
waterfall and he's gonna about to go


---------17:14----------
over the edge and there are rocks down


---------17:16----------
below and it's like you know so there's


---------17:18----------
something about being a superhero that


---------17:20----------
has to do with just the problems you


---------17:24----------
guys face feel so large so it seems like


---------17:27----------
the only way to overcome them is to be


---------17:29----------
superhuman


---------17:31----------
and then and then something about you


---------17:34----------
know Richard is is you know voiced a


---------17:37----------
little bit of frustration with kind of


---------17:38----------
like this what are you just gonna say


---------17:39----------
like we have to just be normal like you


---------17:41----------
know there's a little bit of frustration


---------17:42----------
there so I wanna I want to try to dig


---------17:44----------
into that do and then I think you know


---------17:48----------
we've talked a fair amount about


---------17:49----------
motivation and sort of setting ourselves


---------17:52----------
up for success or failure holding


---------17:54----------
ourselves to high standards how we


---------17:56----------
handle ourselves when we do fail right


---------18:00----------
so like what do you guys think so


---------18:01----------
Richard started off this talk with and


---------18:04----------
Tony will give you a chance to introduce


---------18:05----------
yourself in just a second okay


---------18:07----------
so Tony just I mean sorry Richard


---------18:09----------
started off this conversation he kind of


---------18:11----------
said I went ten days without it sounds


---------18:16----------
like fapping and then I relapsed so he


---------18:20----------
views that as failure right Richard


---------18:25----------
that's a failure what are the rest y'all


---------18:28----------
think about that I've you and more is a


---------18:31----------
stumble than falling over like if you if


---------18:36----------
you imagine the journey is like a series


---------18:39----------
of hurdles it's more like you know you


---------18:43----------
took you cleanly got over ten and then


---------18:46----------
you kind of stumbled on like the 11th


---------18:48----------
but that doesn't mean that you've fallen


---------18:50----------
over and you have to start again


---------18:51----------
it just means you continue and that was


---------18:53----------
a bump in the road I think that's the


---------18:55----------
most helpful perspective because it


---------18:57----------
feels like this sort of guilt and shame


---------19:00----------
that builds with relapse can often sort


---------19:03----------
of push you can just erase all progress


---------19:06----------
you've made because you start to hate


---------19:09----------
yourself again and then that self-hatred


---------19:11----------
further fuels you feel like maybe you


---------19:16----------
know maybe I shouldn't get better maybe


---------19:18----------
I shouldn't get better maybe I should


---------19:19----------
just go back to where I was because I


---------19:21----------
deserve it


---------19:24----------
yeah so I think it's just helpful to try


---------19:27----------
and not feel guilt or shame just accept


---------19:30----------
that you made a mistake but it's a


---------19:32----------
stumble not other people have thoughts


---------19:38----------
yeah I - I guess meditation in that when


---------19:44----------
your mind does wander you don't force


---------19:47----------
yourself to get back in being centered


---------19:51----------
but you gently allow yourself to come


---------19:55----------
back and it's part of the process that


---------19:57----------
every time you are able to come back


---------19:59----------
that's he a rat right and you need


---------20:02----------
multiple repetitions to build that


---------20:05----------
muscle so it's part of the process and


---------20:08----------
you're only it would be I guess a newbie


---------20:12----------
mistake to think that the rule of the


---------20:15----------
game is to not relapse the proper game


---------20:18----------
is to stay in a good connection with


---------20:27----------
allowing yourself to have a good flow of


---------20:32----------
coming back as long as you can come back


---------20:35----------
in the long that's that's the long


---------20:37----------
that's the real game or at least a


---------20:40----------
higher level game so I notice bear


---------20:44----------
nodding but Tony you want to just take a


---------20:45----------
chance to introduce yourself thanks for


---------20:47----------
jumping in by the way uh thank you yes


---------20:51----------
my name is Tony what should you just


---------21:01----------
tell us a little bit about I mean if


---------21:02----------
you're comfortable you can just say I'm


---------21:04----------
Tony and that can be sufficient but you


---------21:06----------
know sometimes it can it's been helpful


---------21:08----------
for other people to hear a little bit


---------21:10----------
about what's bringing you here today and


---------21:12----------
maybe what you struggle with


---------21:17----------
yeah so I've been it's sometimes I care


---------21:25----------
about my I guess my tendency to like a


---------21:31----------
resort to porn and then that's been


---------21:35----------
going on and off since I I think mmm


---------21:39----------
I'm a great grade 5 grade 6 you know


---------21:42----------
what I was like 10 11 12 years old and


---------21:45----------
even more so ever since I got an


---------21:47----------
internet connection


---------21:48----------
and I feel like it's just something I


---------21:51----------
think that's the point is not the


---------21:53----------
problem itself is just a symptom and I


---------21:55----------
think it's just holding me back i


---------21:57----------
whatever the root causes the root


---------21:59----------
problem is what do you think it's a


---------22:01----------
symptom of avoidance


---------22:07----------
I think fighter seeking just shortcuts


---------22:11----------
just I hedonism I think I've what are


---------22:17----------
you avoiding I think emotional pain ego


---------22:25----------
pain responsibility mostly those three I


---------22:33----------
think that's what comes to mind right


---------22:35----------
this moment what do you think about that


---------22:37----------
bear so like in my opinion with Richards


---------22:43----------
I guess instance is that when he does I


---------22:46----------
guess relapse into masturbation that's


---------22:49----------
that's not a failure it's just it would


---------22:53----------
be a failure in my opinion if he was


---------22:56----------
ignoring responsibilities or trying to


---------22:59----------
overcome some some type of emotions you


---------23:02----------
know but I agree with Tony like


---------23:06----------
wholeheartedly actually


---------23:10----------
Richard what's it like to hear other


---------23:12----------
people say that they don't really view


---------23:13----------
you as a failure my first reaction I


---------23:19----------
don't know I I I'm not I don't want to


---------23:23----------
say I'm super hard on myself but I just


---------23:25----------
I made this way to where when I started


---------23:28----------
this journey I failed other people I let


---------23:30----------
a lot of people down and that's what


---------23:32----------
kind of is getting to me because I


---------23:34----------
wanted again I want it to be that


---------23:37----------
superhuman and you know take this on and


---------23:40----------
show other people that it's possible


---------23:41----------
it's just I see it as a slight mist mess


---------23:47----------
up in the road that was ahead of me not


---------23:50----------
like with ghosts instant with when go


---------23:54----------
set the hurdling when you kind of


---------23:56----------
stumbled but you didn't exactly fall you


---------23:58----------
don't have to start all over again


---------23:59----------
you could still kind of I do see it as a


---------24:02----------
stumble but I still look at it as if I


---------24:05----------
failed everyone watching and it's just


---------24:07----------
it sucks I mean I wish I I wanted to be


---------24:10----------
the person that came on stream and


---------24:13----------
showed everyone it was possible and I


---------24:16----------
don't know emotions they're starting to


---------24:18----------
rise yeah I see that


---------24:20----------
so first of all do you guys see how


---------24:22----------
Richard for the first time and all the


---------24:25----------
time we've started we've been speaking


---------24:26----------
is starting to not make sense but you


---------24:30----------
guys see that like you can don't talk


---------24:31----------
you know I'll see what I'm saying like


---------24:34----------
his his words like so he because he's


---------24:36----------
sort of acknowledging so what I'm


---------24:37----------
pointing out is that Richard Richard I


---------24:38----------
don't mean that as an insult what I mean


---------24:40----------
is that there's a part of you that


---------24:41----------
acknowledges and can view things the way


---------24:44----------
that other people are viewing them and


---------24:46----------
there's also this other part of you that


---------24:49----------
is complete like doesn't give two [ __ ]


---------24:51----------
about that


---------24:52----------
yeah it's steep steep routed yep it's


---------24:55----------
correct looked and absolutely right so


---------24:58----------
when other people are encouraging you


---------25:00----------
how are you feeling I always say that


---------25:10----------
again sorry other people are basically


---------25:12----------
like trying to encourage and support you


---------25:14----------
right how do you feel when they do that


---------25:20----------
I guess I guess what I would say is like


---------25:25----------
the superhero mentality has two sides of


---------25:28----------
the coin and when there's failure its


---------25:31----------
catastrophic and when there's


---------25:34----------
encouragement like the reach when I'm


---------25:37----------
taking on the superhuman feat to show


---------25:39----------
everyone it's possible I get energy from


---------25:42----------
the people encouraging me but when when


---------25:46----------
I stumble and fail it still hurts it


---------25:48----------
hurts a lot


---------25:49----------
yeah so I'm gonna even keep him on as


---------25:52----------
weak to kryptonite though say that again


---------25:56----------
sorry goes can you say that Superman is


---------25:58----------
a weak to kryptonite everyone how's that


---------26:01----------
kryptonite even the superhero


---------26:04----------
yeah what does it like to hear that


---------26:06----------
Richard that's it's hard to hear but


---------26:11----------
it's a tough pill to swallow but I'm I'm


---------26:14----------
on the path to swallow it I'm gonna try


---------26:17----------
to put some words into your mouth so I


---------26:19----------
think you sort of hinted at this that


---------26:21----------
when things are going well and other


---------26:22----------
people encourage you it makes you feel


---------26:24----------
good right it fuels you and after you


---------26:27----------
perceive that you've failed and other


---------26:29----------
people encourage you I think you


---------26:31----------
actually feel worse


---------26:34----------
yeah yeah it was hard hearing everyone


---------26:37----------
saying it's hard hearing that it was


---------26:41----------
just a stumble when I'm trying to make


---------26:43----------
it this ultimate fail yeah right so


---------26:47----------
let's just notice that for a second that


---------26:49----------
despite other people trying to help you


---------26:51----------
and support you and I I think you know


---------26:52----------
that these guys care about you right


---------26:53----------
like yeah absolutely so how does that


---------26:57----------
work where like when when we when we do


---------26:59----------
something let's say we mess up and it's


---------27:02----------
unclear how much you've messed up or if


---------27:04----------
this was a stumble or you [ __ ] up


---------27:05----------
catastrophic ly in the world is gonna


---------27:07----------
end


---------27:07----------
like let's just table that for a second


---------27:09----------
and just understand that we it's unclear


---------27:11----------
but what do you guys think about you


---------27:15----------
know what's going on when when someone


---------27:17----------
is receiving support was when people are


---------27:20----------
trying to support another human being


---------27:23----------
and that makes the other human being


---------27:25----------
feel worse have you guys ever been in


---------27:27----------
that situation yeah so how do how does


---------27:31----------
that work like what's going on there


---------27:33----------
it's like having the opposite effect I


---------27:41----------
don't know I like there's an element of


---------27:45----------
trying to just lone-wolf it figure it


---------27:47----------
out myself


---------27:48----------
I don't yeah for me it's pride I come


---------27:56----------
back to the ego because I don't my


---------28:00----------
initial reaction is I don't like to


---------28:02----------
accept help when I when part of me or a


---------28:04----------
lot of me feels like I can do it myself


---------28:07----------
and to accept help means that there's


---------28:09----------
something wrong with me or it feels like


---------28:12----------
that way I see a lot of people nodding


---------28:17----------
yeah yeah I think we relate a lot I


---------28:21----------
think


---------28:23----------
what's that like


---------28:29----------
cool feels kind of cool feels it's


---------28:32----------
interesting you know cuz I mean part of


---------28:35----------
the reason why I didn't mind opening up


---------28:38----------
about fluoridation is just because I


---------28:40----------
know it's more and more common now so I


---------28:42----------
feel like it's not only I'm not alone


---------28:44----------
yes very houses yes yeah Terry Crews


---------28:48----------
that big time


---------28:49----------
big time yeah so let me ask you


---------28:56----------
something this is a little bit more


---------28:59----------
directed at Richard and if you guys feel


---------29:00----------
like this is kind of monopolizing our


---------29:01----------
discussion please let me know but since


---------29:05----------
I think relapse this is all related to


---------29:07----------
relapse okay so Richard when these


---------29:09----------
people say it's just a stumble I would


---------29:12----------
venture that there's a part of your mind


---------29:14----------
that understands that but that you


---------29:16----------
actually feel like they don't understand


---------29:19----------
you as well when they encourage you and


---------29:21----------
you feel I would say elements of that


---------29:27----------
but it's more so I'm just pushing that


---------29:29----------
away yep


---------29:31----------
I'm pushing their input away I'm just


---------29:33----------
trying to UM why are you pushing their


---------29:37----------
input away and other people can answer


---------29:38----------
to if they can relate to Richards


---------29:40----------
situation why let's put it this way why


---------29:42----------
do you guys let's give Richard a second


---------29:45----------
let's ask the group why do you guys


---------29:47----------
think he's pushing you away because we


---------29:51----------
don't understand his full situation


---------29:54----------
maybe because you can only you can only


---------30:04----------
ever truly be your own certain see in


---------30:07----------
life I think there's probably multiple


---------30:11----------
reasons but I think that it's really


---------30:15----------
difficult to accept help when help can


---------30:17----------
feel unstable and temporary and it's


---------30:22----------
very easy to go into the shell a feeling


---------30:25----------
like you need to be just completely made


---------30:28----------
of steel because you're the only one


---------30:29----------
you'll ever be able to rely on so it's


---------30:33----------
possible maybe that's an element but I'm


---------30:36----------
not sure


---------30:40----------
yeah being able to stand on your own two


---------30:43----------
feet is really important to a lot of


---------30:47----------
people it's like it's been said before


---------30:49----------
accepting help kind of acknowledges the


---------30:53----------
fact that there is something like so


---------30:55----------
wrong with you


---------30:57----------
that it's unable to be solved by


---------31:00----------
yourself


---------31:00----------
and that can be very difficult to admit


---------31:06----------
yeah there's also a kind of weird double


---------31:11----------
standard the way you think of help as


---------31:13----------
this thing that other people should get


---------31:15----------
but when it comes to yourself you expect


---------31:18----------
absolutely everything you expect to be


---------31:21----------
superhuman basically and it's a


---------31:24----------
completely sort of irrational thing but


---------31:27----------
even knowing it's irrational it doesn't


---------31:29----------
it doesn't remove it it's it's still


---------31:32----------
there persist


---------31:34----------
so Richard out of what people have said


---------31:37----------
what resonates with you or if anything


---------31:43----------
resonates I said it earlier before but


---------31:45----------
like this lone wolf mentality work


---------31:47----------
there's like a certain level of pride


---------31:50----------
that comes in when I just figure it out


---------31:53----------
myself


---------31:53----------
you know I have all these problems


---------31:55----------
arising and then I being the superhuman


---------32:00----------
self is able to just figure it out


---------32:02----------
myself


---------32:04----------
and it's just it's hard it's hard


---------32:06----------
hearing advice from other people because


---------32:07----------
I I'm on I feel like I'm on this journey


---------32:10----------
alone but I'm at the impact of others


---------32:13----------
trying to I'm stumbling again I'm on


---------32:20----------
this like you've always sold your own


---------32:22----------
problems yes yes no I would say


---------32:28----------
primarily yes that's yeah that's why I


---------32:32----------
expected there why did you expect to


---------32:35----------
hear that um I don't know that's sort of


---------32:41----------
just how I feel in it it seemed like I


---------32:43----------
saw a pattern and it just made sense


---------32:46----------
that that would be the case because if


---------32:48----------
you learned that you're the only one you


---------32:49----------
can ever rely on then that's just how


---------32:52----------
you continue through life yeah so I'm


---------32:57----------
noticing this theme that's emerging


---------32:59----------
right that nofap is a single-player game


---------33:02----------
right and and that I mean that we talk


---------33:06----------
about superheroes we talk is it okay


---------33:08----------
that I make jokes like is that okay like


---------33:09----------
does that yeah I'm hedging it okay going


---------33:16----------
for maximum number of clippable moments


---------33:18----------
but so but seriously like that that's


---------33:22----------
what we cuz like seriously I mean it is


---------33:24----------
right so like when we think about


---------33:25----------
masturbation like masturbation is like a


---------33:26----------
solo exercise the demons that you guys


---------33:29----------
struggle with are are like internal that


---------33:32----------
like all in here like it's you know it's


---------33:35----------
not about the external world it's not


---------33:37----------
about other people even going back to


---------33:39----------
Aaron's analogy which I'm gonna probably


---------33:41----------
do a thousand more times like he's


---------33:42----------
talking about one guy holding on to one


---------33:44----------
log in a stream it's not like a crap


---------33:47----------
like it's


---------33:47----------
like a crowd of people and like the


---------33:50----------
Titanic it's just like you alone and


---------33:53----------
then the other thing that's kind of


---------33:55----------
crazy is that you know III know that you


---------33:57----------
guys feel ashamed for failing but the


---------34:00----------
other really crazy thing is that I think


---------34:01----------
if we got if we actually stopped and


---------34:03----------
looked at it you guys are incredibly


---------34:05----------
self-reliant and you're incredibly


---------34:07----------
resilient and you have high reserves of


---------34:09----------
willpower and that what you guys have


---------34:12----------
done is adopt a strategy in life that in


---------34:15----------
is like a single-player kind of like


---------34:16----------
you're you're playing like it's like


---------34:18----------
you're making an RPG at the beginning


---------34:19----------
and you're gonna do like a single-player


---------34:21----------
like single character playthrough it's


---------34:23----------
like normally it's a party RPG but you


---------34:25----------
guys have decided to do you know one


---------34:27----------
character hog mode absolutely that's


---------34:31----------
what it feels like right you guys living


---------34:34----------
are you guys playing game are you guys


---------34:36----------
playing the game of life on hardmode


---------34:38----------
iron man yeah absolutely absolutely


---------34:41----------
right yeah


---------34:43----------
no save scumming no reloading just


---------34:47----------
what's that like I'm barely like


---------34:54----------
leveling up I'm like not even getting to


---------34:56----------
the next level sometimes I you know have


---------35:00----------
a good kill streak but for the most part


---------35:02----------
in the long run I I can do way better


---------35:04----------
than this so I think that says it all


---------35:08----------
right if I'd say there's one thing that


---------35:11----------
I think all of you guys overwhelmingly


---------35:13----------
agree with it's I can do way better than


---------35:15----------
this yeah where'd you guys get that idea


---------35:23----------
what's that where does that come from


---------35:29----------
social pressures say more about that


---------35:32----------
bear I mean I guess culturally my my


---------35:38----------
family is always all about trying to me


---------35:40----------
trying to get me to get my doctorate or


---------35:43----------
or just be successful and a monetary


---------35:46----------
value but not emotionally I just kind of


---------35:49----------
weighs a heavy burden on its own yeah do


---------35:53----------
you mind if I ask what your ethnicity is


---------35:55----------
my parents are from Pakistan okay yeah


---------36:01----------
so I mean I don't know if you guys so


---------36:03----------
South Asian parents and East Asian


---------36:05----------
parents especially for people who


---------36:06----------
immigrated from our country of origin


---------36:09----------
tend to be very very status oriented


---------36:12----------
they really believe that and I'm sure I


---------36:15----------
mean this is true of not just those


---------36:17----------
cultures but dr. Angelou yeah right so


---------36:22----------
and and it's tough because what they do


---------36:25----------
is they make you feel like your value as


---------36:28----------
a human being is related to things that


---------36:31----------
you check off on a list like bear have


---------36:36----------
you gotten your doctorate yet no I'm


---------36:39----------
actually about to start my Master's


---------36:40----------
burger oh my goodness that's just


---------36:43----------
completely unacceptable yeah yeah right


---------36:47----------
and and they they make you feel like I


---------36:49----------
mean that's that's your measure of value


---------36:51----------
as a human being like it's not that a


---------36:53----------
human being can be more than that it's


---------36:55----------
just you know the measure of value of


---------36:57----------
your degree for me like I can feel like


---------37:05----------
my inner critic and my image of I guess


---------37:08----------
the external critic is like it's so


---------37:11----------
simple just don't touch your peepee you


---------37:13----------
know and how can you how can you mess


---------37:15----------
that up you know so I think that I left


---------37:19----------
that inner critic unchecked for so many


---------37:22----------
years that you know until it more


---------37:25----------
recently I've been now we get the sense


---------37:28----------
that we're not alone


---------37:30----------
yeah I still sort of even hearing that I


---------37:36----------
still sort of maintain the idea that is


---------37:38----------
like solo playing for me it's just sort


---------37:41----------
of really deeply ingrained even though I


---------37:46----------
can intellectually resonate with that


---------37:48----------
the feeling within me is still this is


---------37:51----------
solo player yeah so what do you guys so


---------38:01----------
in a sense it is right because


---------38:02----------
ultimately I think when we think about


---------38:03----------
especially addictions it's we kind of


---------38:09----------
think a little bit about you know


---------38:12----------
ultimately it's an it's an internal


---------38:14----------
journey like no one is gonna slap a


---------38:16----------
chastity belt on you right it struggles


---------38:19----------
that you have to you know deal with on a


---------38:21----------
on a day to day basis but at the same


---------38:26----------
time I think that there is some amount


---------38:28----------
of you know there's there's a different


---------38:29----------
kind of balance that has to be struck so


---------38:32----------
I think at the end of the day these are


---------38:33----------
you know it's it's like the only person


---------38:36----------
that is how can I say this you know at


---------38:39----------
the end of the day the important thing


---------38:40----------
is that Tony not touch his peepee right


---------38:43----------
like it's not about us not touching his


---------38:45----------
peepee it's about Tony not touching his


---------38:47----------
peepee and so and so that there is there


---------38:51----------
is a certain amount of single player


---------38:53----------
earnest to this like absolutely so any


---------38:55----------
kind of substance or addiction that we


---------38:57----------
deal with ultimately is like is gonna


---------38:59----------
have a deep single like single player


---------39:03----------
kind of component to it because no one


---------39:05----------
else is gonna fix this for you it's not


---------39:07----------
about other people fixing you and at the


---------39:10----------
same time I think that as people have


---------39:14----------
kind of mentioned you know the way that


---------39:15----------
you treat yourself is like different


---------39:17----------
from the way that you treat other people


---------39:21----------
and something about that I think is like


---------39:24----------
incredibly toxic right so like Tony was


---------39:29----------
talking a little bit about the way that


---------39:30----------
he left left his inner critic unchecked


---------39:33----------
I think it's a beautiful way of putting


---------39:35----------
it in the case of bear it sounds like a


---------39:37----------
lot of his criticism is not actually


---------39:39----------
coming from internally it's coming from


---------39:41----------
externally but I'd say also in bears


---------39:44----------
case that all of those external


---------39:46----------
statements have created a standard that


---------39:49----------
you measure yourself against right so


---------39:51----------
you accept their premises and they


---------39:53----------
become your premises it's internalized


---------39:58----------
absolutely so there is something


---------40:00----------
incredibly singleplayer about this so my


---------40:05----------
next question kind of goes to primary I


---------40:08----------
mean sort of Richard but anyone can


---------40:10----------
answer so Richard sort of he played a


---------40:12----------
little game where he pretended to be me


---------40:14----------
for a second and and he sort of said


---------40:17----------
like you kind of envisioned almost like


---------40:20----------
what I was gonna say so what do you guys


---------40:21----------
think my response is to what we're


---------40:26----------
talking about so like so it's like a


---------40:31----------
soft spot for me trying to defend it


---------40:36----------
defend what this idea that I'm not a


---------40:42----------
superhero that I that I do have


---------40:46----------
kryptonite that's what you think I'm


---------40:49----------
gonna say no that's what I think I sorry


---------40:52----------
yeah that's okay so I think yeah poor


---------40:57----------
Tony what I think when I think you're


---------40:58----------
gonna say now is that a it's not exactly


---------41:02----------
a single-player game now you there's


---------41:05----------
components of single-player mode but


---------41:07----------
it's like all of us are playing


---------41:10----------
single-player mode beside each other so


---------41:13----------
the rules exactly tutorials we can share


---------41:18----------
our experience we can route each other


---------41:20----------
Wow we could hold each other accountable


---------41:22----------
because it's


---------41:23----------
it's your own game but you're playing


---------41:25----------
amongst brothers who actually for the


---------41:30----------
most part know what you're going through


---------41:35----------
yeah that's that's my inference yeah so


---------41:39----------
I think that's a beautifully put


---------41:42----------
I'm gonna add sort of another layer to


---------41:44----------
it so I'm gonna just talk for a second


---------41:45----------
about the superhero complex because I


---------41:48----------
think that's something that I certainly


---------41:49----------
have felt from time to time like very


---------41:52----------
deeply I think it's something that


---------41:54----------
resonates with our community a lot and


---------41:58----------
so is it okay if I just kind of offer


---------42:00----------
some thoughts about that so first thing


---------42:03----------
is like you know I get the sense that a


---------42:06----------
lot of people feel like they have to


---------42:07----------
make up for lost time and in a sense


---------42:11----------
like what you've got to do is like the


---------42:13----------
the the more screwed up you are the more


---------42:16----------
Herculean you have to be to sort of fix


---------42:18----------
it


---------42:18----------
so I remember like when I was failing


---------42:21----------
out of college and also had had like a


---------42:23----------
bad GPA so I graduated with like a 2.5 I


---------42:26----------
felt like the only way that I could hold


---------42:29----------
my head up with pride was to like do


---------42:33----------
something that was superhuman like go to


---------42:35----------
Harvard for medical school for example


---------42:37----------
right so like the more behind you feel


---------42:39----------
about yourself


---------42:40----------
the higher the standard that you set to


---------42:43----------
kind of like make things even does that


---------42:45----------
make sense


---------42:46----------
I'm gonna jump in and ask a question


---------42:48----------
yeah has anyone here watched the movie


---------42:51----------
limitless okay it kind of feels like


---------42:57----------
that in the sense that like you're like


---------43:00----------
at the start of the movie he's a failed


---------43:01----------
writer and then he takes this pill


---------43:04----------
unleashes his genius and he becomes God


---------43:07----------
basically you sort of feel like you have


---------43:09----------
to do that yeah right so you feel like


---------43:13----------
you have to does it like so the more


---------43:15----------
behind you feel in life the more messed


---------43:18----------
up you feel the more it requires


---------43:21----------
something like really really huge to fix


---------43:24----------
that


---------43:26----------
right because and I think this kind of


---------43:28----------
goes back to just the struggle and like


---------43:31----------
Aaron's like imagery at the beginning


---------43:33----------
which is the size of the struggle that


---------43:35----------
you guys are dealing with is just so big


---------43:37----------
and insurmountable that an ordinary


---------43:40----------
human can't do it what do you guys think


---------43:43----------
about that well I think another part of


---------43:48----------
it for at least for me is that sometimes


---------43:54----------
my ego feels like you know what I am


---------43:58----------
superhuman I'm just gonna allow myself


---------44:01----------
to [ __ ] up because I know I can catch up


---------44:03----------
later


---------44:04----------
you know I can fix this later you know


---------44:06----------
I'm I'm a smart guy


---------44:07----------
I have a lot of potential I'm just gonna


---------44:10----------
solve this problem later I know I could


---------44:13----------
compensate for it I know a miracle I can


---------44:15----------
pull off miracles and I can do this


---------44:17----------
later so that's another part of it I'm


---------44:18----------
not sure if other people relate to that


---------44:20----------
it's like it's hundreds oh yeah I see a


---------44:25----------
lot of people nodding when you guys go


---------44:27----------
back and it goes back and forth between


---------44:28----------
the say shame and then pride so maybe


---------44:32----------
two two sides of the same coin yeah what


---------44:36----------
do y'all think for me at least I guess I


---------44:41----------
was at one extreme when I was younger


---------44:46----------
where I just continually thought that


---------44:48----------
like I I had a massive ego I was at the


---------44:53----------
top of the world it was one and big


---------44:55----------
ambitious I still have extremely big


---------44:57----------
ambitions for this have a different


---------44:58----------
perspective on it now it's more like I'm


---------45:01----------
scum but I guess I sort of think of it


---------45:06----------
as anything that I'm able to accomplish


---------45:09----------
as someone as low as I am if I can do it


---------45:14----------
then maybe I can demonstrate to others


---------45:17----------
that anything is possible if someone is


---------45:20----------
bass and Lobos meet can do it as well


---------45:25----------
um I kind of resonate with the feeling


---------45:28----------
of like I'm smart I can do this later


---------45:32----------
and it almost feels like manic


---------45:35----------
depression where you can oscillate


---------45:38----------
between feeling like I can't achieve


---------45:40----------
anything in life - I can become God and


---------45:44----------
you can just keep swinging back and


---------45:46----------
forth like that that's like when I was


---------45:52----------
younger my my teacher when I was about


---------45:56----------
probably 9 or 10 suggested that I be


---------46:02----------
moved up either 2 or 3 years in school


---------46:06----------
and she didn't want to move me further


---------46:08----------
because it would be disruptive because


---------46:10----------
of the age difference like with


---------46:12----------
teenagers but I refused because I was


---------46:15----------
kind of afraid of that


---------46:16----------
and she wanted me to go to Oxford and I


---------46:19----------
feel like I'm now at a point where I've


---------46:20----------
failed that but there's still a part of


---------46:22----------
me that thinks I could put a miracle out


---------46:25----------
of the bag and it's this constant


---------46:27----------
oscillation between thinking I'm gonna


---------46:29----------
be homeless or like a multi-millionaire


---------46:32----------
and there's no in-between like it's just


---------46:34----------
one or the other all the time


---------46:36----------
so Toni's laughing


---------46:40----------
yeah absolutely I'm either gonna you


---------46:45----------
know become not even a billionaire but


---------46:47----------
like just partially like a Messiah


---------46:51----------
Complex and or just oh my god I


---------46:55----------
I just want to fade into nothingness and


---------46:57----------
you know if a hint of nihilism comes in


---------47:02----------
when I'm at hello and then my sia


---------47:04----------
complex when I'm at my high and that


---------47:05----------
oscillation between there is as real and


---------47:09----------
and then sometimes the lows get lower


---------47:12----------
because okay


---------47:14----------
I've been oscillating between these two


---------47:15----------
modes for how many years now and if I'm


---------47:18----------
being almost honest with myself maybe I


---------47:20----------
do need help


---------47:20----------
so can't do this myself okay so we've


---------47:24----------
come far away from porn addiction but I


---------47:26----------
think this is really important to talk


---------47:28----------
about so I mean I hope people who are


---------47:30----------
watching find this useful so I'm gonna


---------47:33----------
try to offer once again a little bit


---------47:35----------
more kind of like of my opinion about


---------47:38----------
this subject so the first question is


---------47:40----------
like so let's let's just define what


---------47:42----------
we're talking about so I think that when


---------47:45----------
you guys we're talking about porn


---------47:47----------
addiction this particular problem


---------47:53----------
recruits part of our psychology which is


---------47:58----------
this like complete failure versus


---------48:00----------
superhuman amazing person like Messiah


---------48:03----------
genius versus you know no one who's


---------48:06----------
sitting at home playing video games and


---------48:07----------
jerking off


---------48:09----------
so this is a part of us that doesn't


---------48:11----------
just rely like it's not just porn


---------48:13----------
addiction that taps into this right it's


---------48:15----------
like professional expertise


---------48:17----------
it's dating life which we should


---------48:19----------
probably switch to dating in a few


---------48:20----------
minutes


---------48:21----------
you know it's it's like making money


---------48:24----------
it's being respected it's no FAP it's


---------48:26----------
like all of this stuff where and and you


---------48:29----------
guys are noticing that it you oscillate


---------48:31----------
quickly between these two things whether


---------48:33----------
the two things actually seem to be like


---------48:35----------
really connected right so it's it's it's


---------48:39----------
almost like you know sort of saying like


---------48:41----------
oh I keep on oscillating between being


---------48:42----------
awake and being asleep at night and it's


---------48:45----------
like yeah well that's because like


---------48:46----------
sleeping and waking fullness are like


---------48:47----------
fundamentally connected so these are two


---------48:49----------
modes that you operate between it's the


---------48:52----------
first question is do you guys think that


---------48:55----------
playing this game of sometimes feeling


---------48:58----------
like a genius and sometimes feeling like


---------49:01----------
a piece of [ __ ] like is that a good


---------49:02----------
strategy to live life does it work so


---------49:09----------
far okay so then the question is how do


---------49:13----------
we free ourselves of what I call the


---------49:17----------
problem of escalating impossibility


---------49:19----------
which is that the further you fall the


---------49:22----------
more you escalate what you need to do to


---------49:25----------
make yourself kind of feel better so


---------49:28----------
like at the beginning it's a little bit


---------49:30----------
impossible and then after you a year


---------49:32----------
goes by it becomes even more impossible


---------49:35----------
and even more impossible so in in ghosts


---------49:38----------
case he had a chance to skip a couple of


---------49:40----------
grades and then it became Oxford and now


---------49:42----------
it's like he has to do something even


---------49:44----------
bigger right


---------49:46----------
so how do we free ourselves from that


---------49:51----------
any idea it feels like it feels like


---------49:53----------
arrogance maybe a play somewhere yes


---------49:56----------
absolutely it can it can feel like um


---------49:59----------
I'm gonna give myself all these debuffs


---------50:02----------
and watch what I can do


---------50:03----------
yeah watch me succeed even with the D


---------50:05----------
puffs yeah it feels kind of like some


---------50:08----------
showmanship and it's like making your


---------50:10----------
life harder than it has to be just to


---------50:12----------
prove a point


---------50:13----------
yep but I'm not entirely sure that comes


---------50:16----------
from life go for Tony I for myself I


---------50:23----------
think my extreme side thinks that okay


---------50:26----------
I just have to change everything I'm


---------50:29----------
doing because all that I've been doing


---------50:30----------
has gotten me the same results so I have


---------50:34----------
to do everything differently or I think


---------50:37----------
my why's itself kind of this thinking


---------50:40----------
maybe I just have to change one key


---------50:42----------
thing and it's very I do it very gently


---------50:44----------
and you know I almost be effortless okay


---------50:49----------
if I if I just find the right thing that


---------50:52----------
I have to change so I'm gonna go back to


---------50:56----------
ghosts so what we'll put a pin in what


---------50:58----------
Tony said which is essentially change


---------51:01----------
everything versus change one thing and


---------51:03----------
ghosts you kind of said that you don't


---------51:06----------
know where that arrogance comes from


---------51:08----------
where do you think it comes from


---------51:13----------
I think there's like a really just vast


---------51:21----------
supply of anger that's stored and it's


---------51:29----------
like almost I don't have to what it okay


---------51:35----------
so you guys get that like the part of


---------51:40----------
you that wants to be super human wants


---------51:41----------
to make up for the rest of you right


---------51:45----------
like that's why you you you are you


---------51:47----------
switch between being like ego to like


---------51:50----------
like super genius brilliant capable of


---------51:52----------
anything and like nothing so that you


---------51:55----------
guys see how there's like actually


---------51:56----------
balance there and the worse you feel


---------52:00----------
about yourself the more you begin to


---------52:03----------
fantasize about what you're capable of


---------52:06----------
so that's your your minds way of


---------52:09----------
actually protecting you from that shame


---------52:11----------
so it starts to build up this kind of


---------52:14----------
fantasy that you can accomplish this and


---------52:16----------
you can do this and you're gonna show in


---------52:18----------
and ghosts also mention let your gonna


---------52:21----------
like show something to someone that part


---------52:26----------
of this like you know I'm gonna debuff


---------52:27----------
myself and then I'm gonna do it and then


---------52:29----------
I'm gonna show them who's them


---------52:32----------
yeah it's kind of bright sure like who


---------52:35----------
are you who are you trying to do that


---------52:37----------
for what are you trying that's a


---------52:39----------
demonstration do you guys get that the


---------52:41----------
goals that you set yourself are a


---------52:43----------
demonstration and a demonstration has an


---------52:45----------
audience right it's not actually like


---------52:49----------
just internal you're actually you know


---------52:51----------
no fapping for everybody else right so


---------52:55----------
what what are you trying to demonstrate


---------52:57----------
and who are you trying to demonstrate it


---------52:59----------
to maybe could be for just looking for


---------53:08----------
someone to like give you recognition and


---------53:14----------
affection that you have been like


---------53:18----------
missing out on for a long time


---------53:22----------
okay so recognition from others and what


---------53:27----------
will that do if you get recognition from


---------53:29----------
others there's the shameful part and


---------53:31----------
then there's the Massiah part right


---------53:33----------
there's the person whose level zero and


---------53:35----------
there's a person whose level 100 if you


---------53:38----------
get recognition from others who does


---------53:40----------
that help it reinforces our image of the


---------53:44----------
level 100 Pro but it feels like it helps


---------53:48----------
the little zero absolutely so you guys


---------53:54----------
see like the two are linked right


---------53:57----------
because the person who's really hungry


---------53:59----------
for recognition man you could say


---------54:01----------
they're both hungry for recognition and


---------54:03----------
then there's one other person so like so


---------54:06----------
when we demonstrate to the rest of the


---------54:07----------
world that we're capable of succeeding


---------54:10----------
despite all of our difficulties


---------54:14----------
so that's important to show the rest of


---------54:16----------
the world and then who else are we


---------54:18----------
trying to show our case absolutely right


---------54:23----------
so you guys like that's what you want


---------54:25----------
you guys get that like on the deepest


---------54:28----------
level it's not actually about other


---------54:29----------
people it's it's like Richard said I


---------54:32----------
mean he wants to be able to do it by


---------54:34----------
himself and and he wants to be you know


---------54:37----------
he wants to be an example to others but


---------54:40----------
like so I don't know I don't know how to


---------54:46----------
say this beyond just saying it he wants


---------54:48----------
to be an example to others the focus of


---------54:53----------
that statement is actually not on other


---------54:55----------
people


---------54:55----------
the focus he's not saying I want to help


---------54:59----------
others he wants to be an example for


---------55:02----------
others it's actually a deeply


---------55:04----------
egotistical statement yeah right


---------55:10----------
like you want to be the inspiration for


---------55:12----------
them and there's there's a part of that


---------55:14----------
that is absolutely altruistic and


---------55:16----------
absolutely designed like wanting to help


---------55:18----------
others the problem is that there's this


---------55:20----------
other weird complex that kind of like


---------55:22----------
hijacks that a little bit like it's not


---------55:26----------
about helping others it's about being


---------55:28----------
the person who is Superman like he's not


---------55:33----------
trying to trick like if you know he


---------55:35----------
could very easily just lie to everyone


---------55:37----------
and say that he's doing it and inspire


---------55:39----------
people that way right


---------55:41----------
like he can just tell everyone look


---------55:43----------
everyone I'm doing it you can do it too


---------55:45----------
just live his entire life as a live


---------55:48----------
positivity and you can maybe inspire


---------55:51----------
tons of people and so I think it's good


---------55:55----------
that you guys don't do that right


---------55:57----------
because I think the other crazy thing


---------55:59----------
here is I'm gonna ask other people so do


---------56:03----------
you think that Richard if Richard had


---------56:06----------
after last week been transformed and


---------56:09----------
become Superman


---------56:11----------
versus Richard stumbling after ten days


---------56:14----------
and then we continue to watch Richards


---------56:17----------
you know growth over over time which one


---------56:21----------
do you think is actually gonna help


---------56:22----------
people more definitely the ladder


---------56:27----------
yeah the stumbling because if if people


---------56:32----------
see the example where it's just


---------56:34----------
instantaneous it's like look guys I did


---------56:37----------
it I did this superhuman feat and they


---------56:40----------
attempt it and then based on bull then


---------56:42----------
they feel like that different and that


---------56:44----------
they've failed in some way I say see a


---------56:46----------
stumble


---------56:47----------
success story they say oh this person's


---------56:49----------
human and they succeeded therefore I can


---------56:51----------
do it sit right because here's the thing


---------56:55----------
if if Richard wakes up one day in a


---------56:57----------
Superman anything that he discovers


---------57:00----------
about his life in his playbook doesn't


---------57:02----------
apply to anyone else


---------57:05----------
because they're not they're not supermen


---------57:09----------
buying exceptional means that everyone


---------57:12----------
else isn't is not everyone can be


---------57:14----------
exceptional yes or yeah but I think


---------57:18----------
everyone can be exceptional but I I


---------57:21----------
think we're talking about the same thing


---------57:23----------
right so I I think the first thing to


---------57:27----------
understand is that you know when it


---------57:29----------
comes to this kind of stuff so like all


---------57:31----------
of us are flawed and none of us are


---------57:33----------
supermen so Richard is right in terms of


---------57:36----------
you know what he hypothesized I was


---------57:38----------
gonna say but I think the trick here is


---------57:40----------
not letting go of the Superman it's


---------57:43----------
actually letting go of the idea that


---------57:45----------
you're a failure because the Superman


---------57:47----------
arises out of the idea that you're a


---------57:50----------
[ __ ] right so what you really need to


---------57:55----------
do if you want to be free from this


---------57:56----------
whole complex is don't try to be


---------57:58----------
ordinary just just understand that like


---------58:01----------
stumbling is a part of life right and


---------58:04----------
like Tony was kind of saying that like


---------58:05----------
you know the game the goal of meditation


---------58:08----------
is not to have a still mind the goal of


---------58:11----------
meditation is to be able to bring your


---------58:13----------
mind back to a point where you want it


---------58:15----------
to every time your mind wanders and you


---------58:18----------
bring it back to where you want it to


---------58:19----------
that's doing a push-up because you're


---------58:21----------
strengthening the capacity for you to


---------58:23----------
control your mind


---------58:24----------
and it's like excelling in spire floors


---------58:28----------
rather than being flawless exactly so so


---------58:32----------
if I have to pick a strategy in life


---------58:34----------
it's not perfection it's damage control


---------58:37----------
so just think about this like if you're


---------58:39----------
trying to like play a game like you know


---------58:41----------
there are different kinds of builds you


---------58:42----------
can do I don't know if you got I play


---------58:43----------
RPGs so like you know there's like


---------58:44----------
evasion tanking which is the idea that


---------58:47----------
you have a low HP pool and you never get


---------58:48----------
hit and then there's also like damage


---------58:51----------
mitigation with a healer like evasion


---------58:54----------
tanking is like a super high-risk


---------58:56----------
high-reward kind of strategy because if


---------58:57----------
you get a hit once you're dead


---------58:58----------
the more reliable strategy is learning


---------59:01----------
damage control


---------59:02----------
so to accept that you're gonna [ __ ] up


---------59:05----------
and learn how to fix it so I'd say that


---------59:09----------
you know a lot of my success comes from


---------59:13----------
the basic idea that I'm gonna just kind


---------59:15----------
of suck at life and that that's okay and


---------59:18----------
that I can learn and I can grow and I


---------59:20----------
can improve so Richard says that I


---------59:23----------
failed after ten days I've been doing my


---------59:26----------
best to you know put my psychiatrist


---------59:28----------
face on and not actually show my emotion


---------59:30----------
but there's a part of me that's like


---------59:32----------
that's amazing man you went ten days


---------59:35----------
without jerking off yeah so like can we


---------59:41----------
just like pause to just think about that


---------59:43----------
for a second like if you skydive man


---------59:45----------
boom if you school like what if you


---------59:48----------
screw up once every ten days when it


---------59:50----------
comes to masturbation that's actually


---------59:52----------
just a normal amount of masturbation or


---------59:54----------
even less normal a naughty percent


---------59:57----------
success rate like that's what you're


---------60:00----------
looking for you're not looking for


---------60:02----------
celibacy I mean maybe you are no fab


---------60:04----------
right so like whatever y'all's goals are


---------60:06----------
but like like it this is the other thing


---------60:09----------
so people think I'm gonna just talk for


---------60:11----------
a second about sobriety and and relapse


---------60:13----------
and all that kind of crap we can talk


---------60:15----------
about this too but I'm just gonna share


---------60:16----------
some thoughts so like you know people


---------60:18----------
don't get sober overnight even though


---------60:20----------
that's how they perceive it so like what


---------60:23----------
happens when you go to an a a meeting is


---------60:24----------
like you know you see a guy who's like


---------60:26----------
yeah I'm here for my one-year chip and


---------60:28----------
other dudes there for their five-year


---------60:29----------
chip and so what people look at is they


---------60:31----------
look at someone and they see five years


---------60:34----------
of sobriety that started one like five


---------60:37----------
years ago on the day they look at one


---------60:39----------
year of sobriety that started one year


---------60:41----------
ago and that's our perception of success


---------60:43----------
because success is being sober for a


---------60:45----------
year for five years and the dude who's


---------60:49----------
five years sober do you guys know how


---------60:50----------
old he is 55 you guys been to a meetings


---------60:56----------
like there a lot of old dudes at AAA


---------60:57----------
meetings right okay so it's worthwhile


---------61:01----------
to go to an a a meeting like once in


---------61:03----------
your life I think it's a wonderfully


---------61:05----------
inspirational experience probably one of


---------61:08----------
my best experiences from that school


---------61:09----------
actually and so the interesting thing is


---------61:11----------
that like you know sobriety is something


---------61:13----------
that you practice so when I work with


---------61:16----------
people what I see is like okay they've


---------61:17----------
been using for 18 months and then they


---------61:20----------
go like three months of sobriety and


---------61:23----------
then they relapse and they feel awful


---------61:24----------
about themselves and we work through


---------61:25----------
that and then they go nine months


---------61:27----------
without using and then they relapse and


---------61:29----------
they feel awful about that over time the


---------61:31----------
duration between their relapses


---------61:34----------
increases and the severity of their


---------61:37----------
relapses and duration of their relapses


---------61:39----------
actually goes down


---------61:41----------
so there are some times where I really


---------61:43----------
like stop and think because I feel like


---------61:44----------
should I actually so either I've even


---------61:46----------
even patients that I'm considered sort


---------61:47----------
of terminating with so like not firing


---------61:49----------
but sort of saying hey I don't think I


---------61:51----------
can help you because you keep on


---------61:52----------
relapsing and so as a provider I stop


---------61:55----------
and I think like okay I'm not just not


---------61:56----------
getting through to this person but when


---------61:58----------
I actually stop and I like go through my


---------62:00----------
notes I realize oh this guy has had two


---------62:01----------
relapses in the last 24 months and for


---------62:05----------
the five years before that they were


---------62:07----------
using pretty much every day so like


---------62:11----------
understand that relapse is a part of it


---------62:13----------
but what you need to look at is like how


---------62:16----------
long does the relapse last how bad is it


---------62:18----------
and how much how quickly can you kind of


---------62:22----------
get back on the wagon does that make


---------62:27----------
sense yeah and so you guys are gonna


---------62:31----------
[ __ ] up but like that's normal like


---------62:33----------
you're you're learning you're like


---------62:34----------
learning how to control this thing and


---------62:36----------
they're gonna be periods of times where


---------62:38----------
you guys are gonna do a good job at it


---------62:40----------
and they're gonna be periods of times


---------62:41----------
that you're gonna do a bad job at it and


---------62:42----------
there are gonna be times where you do a


---------62:44----------
good job and something really


---------62:46----------
unfortunate is gonna happen in your life


---------62:48----------
that is going to emotionally wear on you


---------62:50----------
and then your capacity for like


---------62:52----------
willpower and discipline is gonna get


---------62:54----------
tanked because you're dealing with all


---------62:56----------
this emotional crap right so like the


---------63:00----------
first question that pops into my I don't


---------63:01----------
think there's actually true but you know


---------63:03----------
I someone like Richard I'd be really


---------63:05----------
careful about like the way that your dad


---------63:07----------
judges you and whether that relates to


---------63:09----------
you fapping and when I talked to out


---------63:12----------
like some of you other guys like it


---------63:13----------
sounds like there are other things that


---------63:15----------
go on like Tony sort of says he thinks


---------63:17----------
it's a symptom of a problem


---------63:19----------
when we talked to bear that too is like


---------63:22----------
his way of getting out of his like head


---------63:25----------
in his analysis paralysis and his


---------63:27----------
feelings of like shame for not being


---------63:29----------
what his like cultural group wants him


---------63:32----------
to be and so if we really think about it


---------63:35----------
like it's not just the fapping it's like


---------63:37----------
all this other crap in the real solution


---------63:40----------
is to deal with all of those things


---------63:42----------
right because if bear is like securing


---------63:43----------
the person he is if he learns how to


---------63:46----------
train his mind a little bit better if


---------63:48----------
Tony not only stops trying to change


---------63:52----------
everything all at once and then Tony's


---------63:54----------
trying to change one thing at a time


---------63:55----------
what Tony really needs to learn how to


---------63:57----------
do is change nothing right so Tony needs


---------64:07----------
to accept where he is and that mistakes


---------64:10----------
are gonna be made and that he's exactly


---------64:14----------
where he's supposed to be and that over


---------64:16----------
time he can change his life but that


---------64:18----------
fundamentally there's nothing wrong with


---------64:20----------
him so if you feel like you have to


---------64:23----------
change something that means that


---------64:25----------
something's not right but this is


---------64:27----------
important to understand you can only be


---------64:29----------
like I don't know if this is this is


---------64:31----------
gonna make no sense okay so you guys can


---------64:33----------
only be the things that you are you


---------64:36----------
can't be anyone else like bear you can't


---------64:40----------
be in a doctoral program right now like


---------64:41----------
it's just not possible like like reality


---------64:44----------
is like one thing a reality is not


---------64:46----------
actually possibilities reality is not


---------64:49----------
like reality is just what it is does


---------64:52----------
that make sense


---------64:54----------
look I know this is gonna sound weird


---------64:57----------
can you reader iterate on the


---------65:00----------
possibilities reality is not


---------65:02----------
possibilities yes are you guys right now


---------65:07----------
like you can't be anywhere except for


---------65:10----------
where you are like it is literally


---------65:11----------
impossible for you to be anything but


---------65:14----------
who you are where you are when you are


---------65:16----------
in this moment only then now there's no


---------65:20----------
actual future there's no past it's only


---------65:24----------
there now yeah and the present is the


---------65:26----------
only place in which you have agency you


---------65:28----------
can't change the past by thinking about


---------65:30----------
it and you can't change the future but


---------65:31----------
you only have agency to change things in


---------65:34----------
the exact Karma


---------65:36----------
yes and so since you let so this is


---------65:38----------
gonna sound absolutely crazy but since


---------65:40----------
you do not have the power to go into the


---------65:42----------
past and change your decisions you


---------65:44----------
actually have no power to be except for


---------65:48----------
where you are


---------65:50----------
that's like nearly impossible


---------65:52----------
Oh God just to share my experience I


---------65:57----------
every time I'm reminded of that I can


---------65:59----------
take a deep breath and accept that and


---------66:02----------
then maybe you know it could be an hour


---------66:06----------
later or a day later then I lose that


---------66:10----------
that that mindset of just allowing


---------66:12----------
myself to be me


---------66:13----------
so I I in a way I relate that to


---------66:17----------
relapsing every time I forget that I all


---------66:19----------
I need to do is just be myself


---------66:21----------
right now that's a win but then when I


---------66:24----------
forget that that's to me it's like


---------66:28----------
parallel to a relapse yep yeah because


---------66:31----------
because what so the thing that that


---------66:33----------
results in relapse so when you are able


---------66:35----------
to be where you are now you enter sort


---------66:39----------
of like a non-judgmental state you're


---------66:41----------
free from a lot of the things that you


---------66:43----------
turn to pornography to protect you from


---------66:46----------
feelings of shame just wanting to


---------66:49----------
relieve what's going on in your head


---------66:51----------
like so sometimes just the process in


---------66:53----------
your head can be just so burdensome and


---------66:56----------
just sucks it's like you know it's like


---------67:00----------
so I used to hate PE class because it


---------67:03----------
was just dumb and it was like I would


---------67:05----------
just run in a circle for like 30 minutes


---------67:07----------
and I was like not very athletic and


---------67:09----------
part of the other problem was I was


---------67:11----------
younger than everyone else in my grade


---------67:12----------
so you know it's like seven and was


---------67:15----------
playing like sports with eight-year-olds


---------67:17----------
like you're at a huge disadvantage and I


---------67:20----------
just never understood that so I thought


---------67:22----------
I was just bad at it sports and things


---------67:24----------
like that but like PE just sucked and it


---------67:26----------
felt like I was just like it just felt


---------67:27----------
torturous like I'm just running around


---------67:29----------
for like half an hour and it's just


---------67:31----------
awful I don't feel good physically I


---------67:32----------
don't feel good mentally and and you're


---------67:35----------
just in your head and it just feels like


---------67:36----------
really really burdensome and you just


---------67:38----------
want it to stop and then along comes


---------67:40----------
porn addiction or video games or any


---------67:43----------
number of other or drugs


---------67:45----------
that can make it stop right and so why


---------67:49----------
wouldn't you use it because you just


---------67:51----------
want to stop what's that whatever is


---------67:53----------
going on in your head I mean what's


---------67:55----------
going on in your head is coming from a


---------67:56----------
couple of places the first is you know I


---------67:58----------
was saying like you know the problem


---------68:00----------
isn't fixing the Messiah the problem is


---------68:01----------
letting go of feeling ashamed of


---------68:03----------
yourself like if you can be comfortable


---------68:06----------
with the person that you are today you


---------68:08----------
don't need anything to make you feel


---------68:11----------
better right if you can be what other if


---------68:16----------
you can tell yourself what other people


---------68:18----------
in this chat are telling you if you can


---------68:21----------
Richard if you can start channeling the


---------68:24----------
voice of these folks instead of your dad


---------68:30----------
right if you can talk to yourself in


---------68:33----------
that way


---------68:34----------
then it becomes easier to be the person


---------68:37----------
that you are and if you can like if you


---------68:40----------
can be tranquil in the moment then the


---------68:42----------
need for porn addiction goes down not


---------68:45----------
saying it's just all cured right because


---------68:47----------
they're also like habits and other kinds


---------68:49----------
of like like neurons play but I I think


---------68:54----------
that's really I mean all this stuff


---------68:55----------
comes down to just being comfortable


---------68:57----------
with where you are and accepting that


---------68:59----------
just because you've made mistakes in


---------69:00----------
life just because you didn't jump ahead


---------69:02----------
to grades just because you're not an


---------69:04----------
adduct role program just because you


---------69:05----------
didn't go to Oxford just because you


---------69:07----------
didn't finish cleaning the garage on


---------69:09----------
time or any number of other things right


---------69:12----------
that like actually you're not in a


---------69:14----------
stream holding on to a log you're in a


---------69:18----------
kiddie pool and you can just put your


---------69:19----------
feet on the ground and you can get out


---------69:21----------
of the water but that's not what it


---------69:24----------
feels like can I interrupt you really


---------69:27----------
yeah of course um so I was yesterday for


---------69:31----------
the Miss gift stream you were talking


---------69:32----------
about ADHD and how he had certain


---------69:36----------
tendencies like the need to be funny


---------69:38----------
when he feels stupid is strengthening


---------69:41----------
that went what's the wind I or Vetta


---------69:45----------
I ever yeah and so I'm trying to think


---------69:49----------
of it now how I'm using this kind of


---------69:52----------
like superhero complex and you said


---------69:55----------
something that I stopped you on it's


---------69:56----------
reality


---------69:58----------
you can't you can't live in possibility


---------70:01----------
you can only live in reality when I'm in


---------70:04----------
those tough moments when like let's say


---------70:06----------
when I get urges I like do this thing


---------70:10----------
where you know how like the superhero


---------70:12----------
complex there's the flip coin there's


---------70:14----------
that there's a superhuman and then


---------70:17----------
there's the the level zero screw-up and


---------70:21----------
in my strengthening so like how misc if


---------70:24----------
was strengthening his relationship with


---------70:27----------
his ire Vetta like using that tendency


---------70:32----------
over and over again am i doing that by


---------70:35----------
living in that possibility when I'm when


---------70:38----------
I'm in this when I'm in this urge state


---------70:41----------
and I live into the possibility of being


---------70:43----------
perfect and being a superhuman am i


---------70:46----------
reinforcing that complex when I live


---------70:48----------
into that possibility


---------70:49----------
absolutely so in my opinion yes so I


---------70:53----------
think the key thing that's why we


---------70:54----------
started with so like when you when we


---------70:56----------
think about ourselves as a superhuman


---------70:58----------
that comes with the other side you guys


---------71:02----------
see that because a superhuman is born


---------71:04----------
out of shame and that's why if you hear


---------71:06----------
what everyone is saying everyone talks


---------71:08----------
about Oscillation no one here has said


---------71:11----------
oh I feel half of it but I don't feel


---------71:13----------
the other half like just think about


---------71:14----------
that for a second there's no look


---------71:17----------
without lying exactly right so this is


---------71:21----------
the concept of something in sanskrit


---------71:23----------
called Advait Vedanta which means non


---------71:25----------
dualism that duality is fundamentally


---------71:29----------
false and all that is is what is right


---------71:32----------
you're not Richard you're not good


---------71:34----------
you're not bad you're just you


---------71:37----------
you're not sufficient you're not


---------71:39----------
insufficient you're just you right like


---------71:45----------
like the only thing that you are is like


---------71:47----------
what you are and where you are and


---------71:49----------
that's all there is and so in this


---------71:52----------
moment you either have the capacity to


---------71:56----------
resist the urge or you don't have the


---------71:57----------
capacity to resist the urge and you have


---------72:00----------
to be careful because if you have an


---------72:02----------
addictive brain your addictive brain is


---------72:04----------
gonna say oh yeah I don't have the


---------72:05----------
capacity to resist the urge and then you


---------72:07----------
notice that and you recognize okay is


---------72:09----------
that the addictive brain that's talking


---------72:11----------
or do I really have the capacity to


---------72:14----------
resist the urge and then you realize


---------72:16----------
that whether you have the capacity to


---------72:18----------
resist the urge or not is dependent on


---------72:20----------
you because capacity is about the future


---------72:22----------
it's not about the now it's a potentials


---------72:27----------
thing which is it's a potential state


---------72:29----------
which is yes and if I had to ask you


---------72:32----------
Richard you know like how did you go ten


---------72:34----------
days without fapping or watching porn or


---------72:36----------
whatever you know like mmm oh this is


---------72:41----------
great yeah I was I just filled my day


---------72:43----------
with doing stuff and then by the end of


---------72:46----------
the day I was already so exhausted that


---------72:48----------
I just went to bed so like like you see


---------72:53----------
how that has no there's no capacity


---------72:54----------
there's no potential that is just doing


---------72:57----------
mm-hmm what you filled your days with


---------73:00----------
stuff that's your solution right that


---------73:03----------
you engage in the present time and time


---------73:06----------
and time again and I don't know what


---------73:08----------
happened on day ten so there could be


---------73:11----------
all kinds of yeah yeah I guess there's


---------73:14----------
an element of like I was just exhausted


---------73:16----------
I didn't like when I was doing stuff


---------73:19----------
beforehand on the tenth day I didn't


---------73:22----------
have that energy to do stuff and then


---------73:24----------
what I did is I just I was just out of


---------73:27----------
energy I don't know yeah so and like


---------73:31----------
that sounds like so that sounds


---------73:33----------
forgivable to me now I don't know


---------73:35----------
exactly what a relapse looks like for


---------73:37----------
you guys right so like sometimes and


---------73:39----------
this is where you know how okay is it to


---------73:42----------
relapse I think it depends on what a


---------73:43----------
relapse looks like so I mean I I'm an


---------73:46----------
addiction psychiatrist in my day job so


---------73:48----------
I work with people who you know their


---------73:49----------
relapses look bad like and fatally I've


---------73:51----------
had two people I've worked with in the


---------73:54----------
last year have passed away unfortunately


---------73:55----------
and and so like it's relapses can be bad


---------73:59----------
and in your case like what does a


---------74:03----------
relapse look like like what relapses


---------74:05----------
look like for you guys for me it's just


---------74:08----------
like anywhere between a wasted


---------74:11----------
hour to three hours and just a bad


---------74:15----------
feeling afterwards and then just wanting


---------74:17----------
to be alone afterwards then not wanting


---------74:19----------
to be productive afterwards


---------74:21----------
and not wanting to be social afterwards


---------74:23----------
for how long so we have the the overall


---------74:28----------
effect including the relapse itself and


---------74:30----------
the shameful afterglow anywhere between


---------74:35----------
an hour to the rest of the day yeah okay


---------74:40----------
it feels like the definition is really


---------74:43----------
subjective and it's kind of I feel like


---------74:47----------
you just have to be honest with your in


---------74:49----------
a sense of I feel like you sort of just


---------74:53----------
know whether you've relapsed or not but


---------74:55----------
you can lie to yourself and kind of


---------74:57----------
rationalize that something wasn't


---------74:59----------
relapse with really arbitrary metrics I


---------75:02----------
guess so it's just all about honesty


---------75:04----------
with yourself err did you want to say


---------75:12----------
something


---------75:12----------
you've been yeah relapse for me it's it


---------75:23----------
can be wildly variant but like it can be


---------75:27----------
as Tony said where it's just like


---------75:31----------
happens and then there's like a period


---------75:33----------
of shamefulness and then uh when like


---------75:38----------
for example my depression was really bad


---------75:39----------
it can like end up where the shame like


---------75:42----------
feeds into negative loop thoughts cycle


---------75:45----------
and then like things get very mentally


---------75:49----------
serious for me and then you can get very


---------75:51----------
possibly lethal for me yeah right so I I


---------75:58----------
think you know that there is a lot of


---------76:01----------
individuality to this and also frankly a


---------76:06----------
wide spectrum of severity right so I


---------76:10----------
mean if you also suffer from depression


---------76:12----------
or whatnot like it's you got to be


---------76:14----------
careful because all this stuff like


---------76:16----------
feeds on like they're all buddies like


---------76:18----------
this is the problem is like you guys are


---------76:20----------
playing a single-player game but like


---------76:22----------
your demons are playing multiplayer


---------76:24----------
like you guys are so low cueing and


---------76:27----------
they're like a five stack and it [ __ ]


---------76:30----------
sucks


---------76:32----------
if the solo carry yeah like you're


---------76:35----------
playing with a bunch of these pubs who


---------76:37----------
like you'd rather have bots on your team


---------76:38----------
and then they're you know like your


---------76:42----------
depression being for an addiction and


---------76:44----------
your video game addiction and your you


---------76:46----------
know shame from not having a job and


---------76:50----------
your shame from not having a girlfriend


---------76:51----------
like the five of them queue up and then


---------76:54----------
like you know I don't know if you guys


---------76:56----------
have seen this like I play dota but like


---------76:58----------
when people's like you know when they're


---------77:00----------
like the pictures next to their names


---------77:02----------
like line up to form an image you guys


---------77:05----------
see Matt and like that's when you know


---------77:07----------
like when it's like the bare bones of


---------77:09----------
your old Kim Jang Geun or something and


---------77:14----------
then and you know they're also like


---------77:17----------
different they're different ranks right


---------77:18----------
so like some people have bad depression


---------77:20----------
so it's like some like you know some


---------77:21----------
high level player who's smurfing I used


---------77:26----------
to play overwatch with a couple of


---------77:29----------
buddies of mine who were pros and they


---------77:31----------
would just it would be a [ __ ] joke


---------77:34----------
when I would play tracer and he just


---------77:35----------
killed their entire team over and over


---------77:38----------
and over and over and over again and so


---------77:41----------
the result was that I never learned how


---------77:43----------
to play overwatch he would literally


---------77:45----------
like be like 27 and Oh at the end of the


---------77:47----------
game he would just give all of them


---------77:50----------
and so I still don't know how to play


---------77:51----------
overwatch but it's it's tough right so I


---------77:57----------
think when it when it comes down to it


---------77:59----------
you know if I have to summarize so the


---------78:01----------
first thing to understand is that be


---------78:03----------
careful about your fantasies in your


---------78:04----------
Superman because is bizarre as that


---------78:07----------
sounds like the reason that you guys


---------78:08----------
believe in your Superman is because you


---------78:10----------
guys actually are capable of that


---------78:13----------
because Superman has existed for you and


---------78:15----------
you've gone the extra mile and you've


---------78:17----------
done things that are actually superhuman


---------78:18----------
and so on the one hand I want you guys


---------78:21----------
to understand that you know a lot of


---------78:23----------
people think about teams is there like


---------78:25----------
like who you are like you try to define


---------78:27----------
by your weakest link like that's what we


---------78:29----------
do we define ourselves by our low points


---------78:32----------
in life but what you should really do is


---------78:35----------
define yourself by your high point


---------78:36----------
because that's actually what you're


---------78:37----------
capable of right and it's not about the


---------78:41----------
future it's not about hope it's not


---------78:42----------
about fantasy it's about what you've


---------78:44----------
actually done before if you can go ten


---------78:46----------
days without fapping you can go ten days


---------78:48----------
again if you can go three years without


---------78:51----------
a drink you can go three years again


---------78:53----------
like if you've done it once you can do


---------78:54----------
it again that's something that we know


---------78:57----------
right like that's a statement of fact


---------78:58----------
you can do it again the second thing is


---------79:01----------
to be aware that like you have to let go


---------79:04----------
of your Superman complex and you have to


---------79:06----------
let go of your level zero newb you have


---------79:09----------
to let go of the person who's [ __ ] up


---------79:11----------
because like as crazy as it sounds like


---------79:13----------
you couldn't have been different before


---------79:14----------
right you're not the person that you are


---------79:17----------
today you're every day makes you uxp up


---------79:20----------
a little bit and you like learn things


---------79:23----------
and you level up your skill like that's


---------79:24----------
what happens in life do you guys like


---------79:25----------
Remember Who y'all were five years ago


---------79:28----------
like you remember that kid yeah like


---------79:33----------
that kid didn't know anything right you


---------79:39----------
learned so much and just because you


---------79:40----------
don't have a doctorate or like your life


---------79:42----------
- isn't moving forward in kind of a very


---------79:44----------
noticeable way doesn't mean that you


---------79:46----------
aren't getting better and this kind of


---------79:49----------
goes back to this idea of the ten year


---------79:50----------
overnight success so like you know


---------79:53----------
people think of all of these like


---------79:55----------
institutions as overnight successes and


---------79:58----------
I mean if you just look at them you know


---------80:03----------
slates in progress


---------80:05----------
absolutely so like a good example that I


---------80:07----------
use with is Airbnb you guys know what


---------80:09----------
Airbnb is so air B&B launched four times


---------80:13----------
they had three launches that were just


---------80:16----------
complete failures and then their fourth


---------80:20----------
launch was wildly successful like even


---------80:22----------
when it comes to healthy gamer it's like


---------80:24----------
you know I used to get together on back


---------80:27----------
in 2000 the end of 2017 and I started


---------80:30----------
working with gamers on discord there


---------80:33----------
were like 10 of us we worked together


---------80:35----------
for a year we were very very small and


---------80:37----------
it was still fun and it was like really


---------80:38----------
enjoyable and we helped people a lot and


---------80:40----------
then over the past couple of weeks like


---------80:43----------
literally weeks we've blown up but like


---------80:44----------
this has been a story that's like


---------80:46----------
decades in the making and you guys just


---------80:50----------
see like so this is where you know it


---------80:52----------
also comes back to being Superman so


---------80:55----------
something that I try very hard to do is


---------80:56----------
like actually avoid the Messiah Complex


---------80:58----------
of myself so people think I'm special my


---------81:00----------
whole point is that I'm not


---------81:03----------
right like the reason that I can say


---------81:05----------
this stuff is because you know I used to


---------81:08----------
play playstation and jerk off all the


---------81:09----------
time when I was a freshman in college


---------81:11----------
like that's just what every day was it's


---------81:14----------
like skipping class jerking off playing


---------81:15----------
PlayStation and apparently like making


---------81:17----------
girls cry when they try to give you


---------81:19----------
their number right like I mean just how


---------81:22----------
bad is that's just bad guys that's bad


---------81:27----------
yeah I did all of that except for the


---------81:29----------
PlayStation yeah so props dude so do you


---------81:35----------
have a time to get into relationship


---------81:37----------
absolutely let's do it yeah


---------81:39----------
quicker wait um just I want to host like


---------81:42----------
one question gallon you mentioned like


---------81:45----------
doshas before I just wanted to I'm


---------81:47----------
curious if you have like a solid idea


---------81:52----------
where everyone's doshas here after just


---------81:54----------
like an hour of talking to her


---------81:55----------
sure do you have like a solid idea for


---------82:00----------
everyone yeah I think so


---------82:03----------
you want another thing artists that


---------82:05----------
would be fun yeah okay so I think


---------82:09----------
Richard is predominantly pizza I think


---------82:12----------
bear is predominantly goof-up Aaron I


---------82:16----------
think you were Vuitton gufa ghosts I


---------82:19----------
think you're bitten maybe Vata and Tony


---------82:24----------
maybe I'm not so sure about Tony you


---------82:27----------
have you have fought the features and


---------82:29----------
Gotha features actually but hard to say


---------82:35----------
yeah I think part of me just likes to be


---------82:38----------
ambiguous and not be pigeonholed so for


---------82:42----------
some reason I I think I subconsciously


---------82:44----------
try to mmm be everything you know like


---------82:49----------
all the good time


---------82:51----------
like be amorphous yeah but let's let's


---------82:56----------
move on to relationships go sorry I I


---------82:58----------
want to just make sure we have time for


---------82:59----------
this but I'm always I would love to talk


---------83:01----------
more about my brother but that's my


---------83:03----------
initial instinct so who wants to so


---------83:10----------
let's talk about relationships well I'm


---------83:16----------
not sure if this is appropriate before


---------83:17----------
we move on I want to quickly say like


---------83:20----------
you know I feel good about this and I


---------83:22----------
love you guys for being here and thank


---------83:25----------
you for sharing you know yeah especially


---------83:27----------
into the hard parts yeah man and then


---------83:32----------
with that being said relationships right


---------83:35----------
now I feel like I'm avoiding


---------83:37----------
relationships because I feel like I


---------83:40----------
thought I don't want a part of me feels


---------83:42----------
like I'm I want that I want to be you


---------83:47----------
know again the the level 100 pro first


---------83:51----------
otherwise bad things will happen


---------83:53----------
otherwise the other person will get hurt


---------83:56----------
and I also afraid of rejection I think


---------84:02----------
that's where I'm at


---------84:04----------
who else wants to be perfect before they


---------84:08----------
start no surprise right so what does


---------84:15----------
that mean when I say who wants to be


---------84:16----------
perfect before they start


---------84:22----------
maybe it's an idea go for it bear yep


---------84:26----------
it's like oh we bought we want to be


---------84:29----------
that Superman that super super human


---------84:32----------
being before we jump into something that


---------84:33----------
might make us more vulnerable why


---------84:40----------
why is it important to be perfect before


---------84:42----------
you start okay will table it so first of


---------84:50----------
all being perfect before you start is


---------84:52----------
that damage mitigation with healing or


---------84:55----------
evasion tanking evasion very good guys


---------84:59----------
see that


---------85:00----------
good so we'll get we'll get to what that


---------85:03----------
means okay so and then also Tony you


---------85:07----------
said is that you you know you want to be


---------85:09----------
level 100 before you start and then what


---------85:11----------
was the other thing that's keeping you


---------85:14----------
from engaging in a relationship so what


---------85:18----------
I feel really down when in wouldn't in


---------85:21----------
the past I've let people down and I'm


---------85:23----------
especially hurt when other people are


---------85:25----------
hurt


---------85:26----------
so those and I think I've been scarred


---------85:29----------
from that you know I'm because I've let


---------85:32----------
myself down so many times I'm kind of


---------85:34----------
that to some degree but it really hurts


---------85:37----------
when yeah thank you


---------85:38----------
when other people that I care about are


---------85:41----------
genuinely hurt and then that's part of


---------85:44----------
me can't forgive myself for hurting


---------85:45----------
other people for being reckless or just


---------85:50----------
not being prepared or not being


---------85:53----------
responsible for what I am putting myself


---------85:58----------
into other people have just general


---------86:04----------
thoughts about the way that they view


---------86:06----------
relationships my well I guess as of


---------86:16----------
right now I'm just avoiding


---------86:18----------
relationships because last one I was


---------86:20----------
then I was cheated on and so like sorry


---------86:25----------
two of them well yeah it's fine it just


---------86:30----------
goes further to reinforce like I haven't


---------86:37----------
had self-confidence issues in a while


---------86:40----------
but when something like that happens it


---------86:42----------
goes


---------86:44----------
to destroy a lot of progress than making


---------86:46----------
that area and then also my relationships


---------86:50----------
that have always just been a mess I just


---------86:52----------
can't seem to find a healthy


---------86:53----------
relationship I've been in a relationship


---------86:57----------
to where I was like I break up with them


---------86:59----------
and then I was like harassed for months


---------87:01----------
after by them relationships or like I've


---------87:05----------
been cheated on yeah it's just never


---------87:09----------
been healthy interactions with me with


---------87:11----------
relationships that sucks man yeah and


---------87:16----------
for me like every time I hear horror


---------87:18----------
stories from other people you know it


---------87:21----------
makes me feel like like [ __ ] I don't


---------87:24----------
want to get involved with that then you


---------87:25----------
know with all the bad news that I hear


---------87:28----------
and you know I just I'm just filled with


---------87:32----------
fear and and pain avoidance every time I


---------87:34----------
hear something like that happens and on


---------87:38----------
top of that you know I didn't have my


---------87:43----------
parents be in a best relationship as I


---------87:47----------
was going older and even to this point


---------87:49----------
so that's for me that's a big part of it


---------87:51----------
just not seeing a healthy relationship


---------87:53----------
right in front of my eyes over and over


---------87:58----------
again so that I can be inspired and I


---------87:59----------
can model that down to my subconscious


---------88:03----------
level I like that


---------88:05----------
yeah I resonate with that too I actually


---------88:09----------
just got out of like one of those horror


---------88:11----------
story relationships where it was a whole


---------88:14----------
lot of gaslighting abuse to the point


---------88:16----------
where I was beginning to become


---------88:18----------
delusional and my friends my family and


---------88:22----------
even my therapist started to turn on me


---------88:24----------
to a certain things


---------88:26----------
it was it's a very crazy situation I


---------88:32----------
don't know if this is voyeuristic but I


---------88:35----------
find myself being very curious curious


---------88:38----------
how I yeah me too


---------88:39----------
I'm willing to answer all questions I


---------88:41----------
very respect curiosity yeah bear I'm


---------88:46----------
particularly surprised that in a


---------88:48----------
relationship it sounds like everyone


---------88:51----------
around you turned on you that's really I


---------88:56----------
don't think I've heard of that happening


---------88:58----------
even including your therapist like


---------89:00----------
that's really strange


---------89:02----------
so it was I'm a really highly empathetic


---------89:06----------
individual and I'm very agreeable and YX


---------89:11----------
was I mean I would label her as a covert


---------89:16----------
narcissist and she just kind of got


---------89:21----------
everyone to turn on me I don't really


---------89:23----------
know how but they were they got to the


---------89:26----------
point where my friends in my family and


---------89:28----------
even my therapist started to Gaslight me


---------89:30----------
along with with the same stories that


---------89:32----------
she would tell me it sounds awful man


---------89:38----------
yeah for those who I mean maybe


---------89:41----------
something you gather I know but from


---------89:43----------
what I've heard and read when you're


---------89:45----------
very empathic you naturally attract


---------89:49----------
narcissists to know to take advantage of


---------89:52----------
that situation hundreds yeah and then to


---------89:58----------
add on to that like I think I'm


---------90:01----------
naturally empathic and then being afraid


---------90:04----------
of being hurt by narcissist


---------90:06----------
I kind of shove away my empathy


---------90:10----------
sometimes and sometimes I'm a jerk so I


---------90:12----------
don't get taken advantage of and then


---------90:14----------
sometimes if I'm not careful I'm


---------90:16----------
paranoid of becoming a narcissist myself


---------90:18----------
like I'm swinging to the other extreme


---------90:20----------
yeah you know I'm always asking myself


---------90:22----------
oh my god am I gonna become a narcissist


---------90:24----------
and my you know cuz I want to be the


---------90:26----------
other and like I shift what I'd rather


---------90:28----------
hurt people or be hurt you know whereas


---------90:32----------
I'd rather be just me I've been


---------90:38----------
described as um by like multiple girls


---------90:42----------
as impenetrable in the sense that they


---------90:45----------
feel like when they try to get through


---------90:49----------
to me someone said that they even if


---------90:55----------
they talk to me for years they feel like


---------90:56----------
they wouldn't truly know me like they


---------90:58----------
know other people and the as much depth


---------91:01----------
as other people have they feel like


---------91:03----------
everyone has a core but I've been told


---------91:06----------
that they feel like with me it's just


---------91:08----------
more and more less and then I was


---------91:12----------
telling this to one of my friends and


---------91:14----------
then he said that it seems like it's a


---------91:19----------
shifting puzzle that you can peel back a


---------91:21----------
larren and the whole thing reshapes and


---------91:23----------
then you're even more confused and it's


---------91:25----------
like this subconscious thing where I


---------91:28----------
just can't let anyone in and it's like


---------91:30----------
I've never truly seen and I don't know


---------91:35----------
it's or just terrifies me what terrifies


---------91:38----------
you there's a lot of aspects to it like


---------91:46----------
feels like I don't know the depth of my


---------91:48----------
self which is quite scary and it's like


---------91:54----------
maybe I can never truly be myself in


---------91:59----------
front of anyone not even myself because


---------92:02----------
of what what I may find that you know


---------92:04----------
that's so significant that I'm blocking


---------92:08----------
it even for myself and then maybe I


---------92:10----------
can't ever


---------92:11----------
unravel that puzzle so I'm gonna ask the


---------92:15----------
group a question and I want to give


---------92:18----------
Richard a chance to share if he wants to


---------92:20----------
but do you guys feel like you'll be all


---------92:22----------
know ghosts yeah kind of yeah yeah what


---------92:31----------
do you think about that Ghost


---------92:37----------
well actually two it goes just so you


---------92:41----------
understand where I'm coming from I feel


---------92:43----------
like I like I know where you're coming


---------92:44----------
from but you just take it a one or two


---------92:47----------
steps further but not that far not not


---------92:51----------
too far from from my Syrian coast what


---------92:55----------
do you think of um okay I kind of I


---------93:02----------
understand why you'd say that but I also


---------93:04----------
feel like there are multiple aspects to


---------93:06----------
a person in that you can have a persona


---------93:07----------
and you can either sort you're getting


---------93:11----------
do you think we're getting a persona I


---------93:13----------
think you're getting hints of every so


---------93:18----------
often there's like a moment of depth but


---------93:23----------
then it can kind of go back to persona


---------93:24----------
like there's a lot of things that I just


---------93:26----------
don't say sure and I would say that most


---------93:32----------
of the people here know who you are how


---------93:38----------
does that sit with you


---------93:43----------
I'm not sure I agree because I feel like


---------93:48----------
yep how would it sit with you


---------93:51----------
what is so I know you don't agree but


---------93:54----------
how does it sit with you if people do


---------93:57----------
know who you are uncomfortable because


---------94:03----------
I'm not sure that I know who I am yeah


---------94:05----------
I'd like to be able to have people know


---------94:08----------
who I am and be my authentic self but I


---------94:11----------
I kind of just it feels like I've my


---------94:16----------
entire life I felt like a hurricane that


---------94:19----------
just destroys anything that gets too


---------94:20----------
close so I try to keep people away and


---------94:24----------
that's sort of why I evade and that it's


---------94:27----------
a combination of not wanting to get hurt


---------94:29----------
but also not wanting to hurt others


---------94:32----------
so ghosts I'm gonna interrupt you in a


---------94:34----------
very insensitive way just ask the group


---------94:36----------
cuz I'm gonna just I'm gonna bludgeon


---------94:37----------
you with a hammer so so would you guys


---------94:39----------
describe your experiences with ghosts


---------94:43----------
would you guys describe him as a tornado


---------94:45----------
that hurts everything in its path


---------94:47----------
definitely not potentially to be honest


---------94:53----------
potentially yeah what do you guys see


---------94:56----------
he's very insightful very very ins he's


---------95:01----------
caring he tries to uh it's always trying


---------95:06----------
to rationalize things and ways and


---------95:08----------
connects to people in ways that way they


---------95:10----------
can feel more personal with what's going


---------95:15----------
on so very I guess little it's a little


---------95:19----------
selfless thing to do but it's like


---------95:21----------
appreciated stop ghost is cool as [ __ ]


---------95:25----------
look at him right now he is stoic you


---------95:28----------
know his accent he's in the shadow of it


---------95:30----------
now look at that that's so [ __ ] cool


---------95:34----------
Wow yeah ghost everything he said just


---------95:37----------
him like a u-turn it was completely


---------95:40----------
alien to me I don't I don't see that I


---------95:43----------
see someone expressing an authentic


---------95:47----------
vulnerable side to themselves on stream


---------95:49----------
and I don't see any tornado I don't see


---------95:52----------
any shifting puzzle and does anyone else


---------95:55----------
see that I don't see


---------95:59----------
so ghosts like generally speaking like


---------96:03----------
the people on this stream tend to be


---------96:05----------
pretty right right


---------96:07----------
like when they say stuff I think that


---------96:10----------
like I I would I would venture that you


---------96:12----------
think that what they have to say or the


---------96:13----------
way that you've demonstrated yourself


---------96:16----------
maybe you're you know putting on a


---------96:17----------
persona is that you you tend to respect


---------96:19----------
and value what other people say it seems


---------96:22----------
like a lot of what they've said has


---------96:24----------
resonated with you and a lot of what


---------96:25----------
you've said is resonated with them would


---------96:27----------
you agree with that yeah I would agree


---------96:30----------
with that so how I feel like how do you


---------96:33----------
explain that these guys think that


---------96:35----------
you're this awesome person they also


---------96:36----------
know who you are


---------96:37----------
they're strangers across the internet


---------96:39----------
you guys have presumably been talking


---------96:42----------
about porn addiction for a couple of


---------96:43----------
hours what how how does that work I


---------96:49----------
think I be caring but maybe it's that's


---------97:01----------
definitely a destructive streak in me


---------97:03----------
trauma that can be quite unsettling


---------97:06----------
because it like that definitely is this


---------97:09----------
caring part to me but when people see


---------97:12----------
that destructive element of me it kind


---------97:14----------
of terrifies them because they wonder


---------97:15----------
how there can be such I'm almost sort of


---------97:20----------
scared of that part of myself sure like


---------97:23----------
a like the Jungian shadow in a sense I


---------97:25----------
guess yeah I also have that sort of


---------97:30----------
sense that's why I'm not afraid of it


---------97:32----------
seen it myself


---------97:34----------
and I guess um I think I'm quite I'm a


---------97:37----------
few years older than you so I like I'm


---------97:40----------
used to it more so that's why I'm not


---------97:42----------
really afraid of it like when you talked


---------97:44----------
earlier about this like sea of anger


---------97:48----------
that you might have I resonated a lot


---------97:51----------
with me but uh yeah I'm not afraid of it


---------97:57----------
can you tell us about a little bit about


---------97:59----------
how your relationship with Aaron your


---------98:03----------
your sea of anger has changed over time


---------98:09----------
a lot of it was there was always like a


---------98:18----------
focal point to it when I was younger it


---------98:22----------
was like my circumstances and other


---------98:25----------
people and when I got a little bit older


---------98:27----------
it turned into me and y'all just get


---------98:33----------
stuck in like this whirlpool


---------98:35----------
swirling around and it ends it's just


---------98:39----------
always centered on you and then I hit a


---------98:43----------
point in my life where I just like hit


---------98:46----------
rock bottom so hard that it bounced off


---------98:48----------
the floor and kind of broke who I was


---------98:54----------
and my ego and once that happens it was


---------98:59----------
just like all the raging waters of anger


---------99:04----------
just sort of like calmed down I was able


---------99:06----------
to just be yes that that resonates Arlo


---------99:14----------
in the sense of like you said that you


---------99:20----------
sort of directed out yourself and I'm


---------99:25----------
wondering if that's because you did that


---------99:29----------
come from you not wanting to hurt other


---------99:30----------
people so you felt if I'm gonna hurt


---------99:33----------
anyone it's gonna be myself is that what


---------99:35----------
okay yeah oh yeah that makes a lot yeah


---------99:38----------
that resonates like really deeply yes I


---------99:41----------
was so scared of hurting others and like


---------99:47----------
I still have that like innate fear that


---------99:49----------
I can be like a little insensitive or I


---------99:52----------
can like what the switch then all of a


---------99:55----------
sudden I'm like this just evil person


---------99:57----------
and I can just hate everyone and


---------100:00----------
everything and I won't care about anyone


---------100:02----------
but I guess you start to realize that uh


---------100:06----------
I don't know you everything just seems


---------100:11----------
to calm down


---------100:12----------
once you find those connections with


---------100:15----------
people and the more that you find is the


---------100:18----------
more that it seems to like calm the


---------100:20----------
waters when I was uh when I was fifteen


---------100:25----------
my plan was like I felt like all I was


---------100:32----------
was just a ball of suffering and I felt


---------100:35----------
like a ticking time bomb and I thought


---------100:39----------
if I go on living like this and I go on


---------100:42----------
trying to interact with people I'm just


---------100:44----------
going to spread as much suffering into


---------100:46----------
the world as possible so the most


---------100:48----------
productive solution I saw in my fifteen


---------100:50----------
year old brain was I'm just gonna


---------100:54----------
isolate myself completely from everyone


---------100:56----------
sever ties be annoying because if I'm


---------101:00----------
this ticking time bomb the best thing I


---------101:01----------
can do is kill myself so to minimize the


---------101:04----------
impact of my death I'll just push


---------101:06----------
everyone as far away as possible to the


---------101:08----------
point where everyone forgets about me


---------101:10----------
because the further they are from the


---------101:12----------
explosion the less hurt they are and I


---------101:14----------
thought this that in the short term


---------101:16----------
suicide would hurt other people more but


---------101:19----------
in the long run I would prevent any


---------101:21----------
further damage that I could do to people


---------101:24----------
but I've since kind of I've sat with


---------101:26----------
that that self-hate for so


---------101:28----------
long in like the last month I've kind of


---------101:31----------
gotten just sick of it to the point


---------101:32----------
where off like the first time in 18


---------101:36----------
years of my life I actually am trying to


---------101:40----------
be my own advocate and view myself as a


---------101:45----------
person that's worthy of happiness


---------101:47----------
because I never thought it was yeah I


---------101:50----------
want to relate that to that just a bit


---------101:53----------
like yesterday there was events going in


---------101:58----------
my house that were triggering me and you


---------102:01----------
know usually I would just kind of


---------102:02----------
abandon my inner child but then


---------102:04----------
yesterday I just kind of like try to


---------102:06----------
soothe myself and be my own advocate be


---------102:08----------
my own friend and just like be there for


---------102:10----------
myself and kind of let the outer


---------102:13----------
triggering shitty world kind of fade out


---------102:16----------
and just be there with myself and like


---------102:18----------
you know take care of my my inner you


---------102:22----------
know just take care of myself like my


---------102:23----------
inner child like like Tony it's it's


---------102:25----------
alright man I'm with you man I'm gonna


---------102:27----------
take care of you like it's gonna be


---------102:29----------
[ __ ] shitty outside but I'm here for


---------102:32----------
you yeah yeah I'm glad to hear them


---------102:37----------
actually and if you don't mind you said


---------102:40----------
that your ego you had to experience that


---------102:44----------
brokered ego and then everything calmed


---------102:47----------
down can you just give a um I'm not sure


---------102:53----------
how into detail I can go into it on


---------102:56----------
streem other than volts yeah it's um I


---------103:03----------
had two very near-death experiences and


---------103:09----------
I guess that puts a lot of pressure on


---------103:14----------
the mind and it just sort of um it was


---------103:20----------
almost like flicking a switch and


---------103:22----------
everything just seemed to calm down


---------103:26----------
almost like an apathetic state but


---------103:30----------
because I wasn't like born apathetic i


---------103:34----------
stoled like knew what emotions were I


---------103:37----------
was I've been able to like slowly like


---------103:40----------
reintroduce myself


---------103:42----------
mature way like how to process emotions


---------103:44----------
out to you like be frustrated instead of


---------103:49----------
like raging you like be just like sad


---------103:56----------
and be able to grieve instead of just


---------103:57----------
being like writhing and despair just


---------104:00----------
like being able to tone back the


---------104:02----------
extremities of those emotions and also


---------104:06----------
turn back the Messiah Complex that I had


---------104:12----------
thanks for sharing your I want to just


---------104:16----------
kind of so I have man so many questions


---------104:19----------
so first is like we're talking about


---------104:21----------
some dark [ __ ] how do you guys feel good


---------104:27----------
Sara oh good I feel good I feel great


---------104:31----------
weird good yeah like this is some real I


---------104:39----------
mean this is some dark stuff right and


---------104:41----------
even ghosts even has his SIF lighting on


---------104:47----------
so I mean we're talking about this you


---------104:50----------
know we're talking about the Maori


---------104:53----------
Jedi's okay


---------104:54----------
so we're talking about you know


---------104:57----------
different we're talking about just a lot


---------104:59----------
of bad stuff and yet have you guys seen


---------105:04----------
the comments from the YouTube the


---------105:06----------
comments to the YouTube video of our


---------105:09----------
last session


---------105:10----------
not particularly no so I don't usually


---------105:13----------
look at like our own social media cuz I


---------105:16----------
just try to steer clear of it but that


---------105:18----------
is some of the most inspiring [ __ ] I've


---------105:20----------
ever seen can you give like in it's hard


---------105:24----------
to describe just just the overwhelming


---------105:26----------
amount of positivity and hope that the


---------105:31----------
last stream is created from for random


---------105:34----------
people who comment on YouTube videos is


---------105:36----------
staggering and oh my YouTube comments


---------105:40----------
are accessible so that's that's good to


---------105:42----------
hit I've just as stunned as you are


---------105:45----------
right so like you you take a place like


---------105:47----------
YouTube and like you guys know what


---------105:49----------
YouTube comments are like right it's


---------105:51----------
like worse than twitch at its the


---------105:53----------
underbelly of society it's the worst and


---------105:56----------
then you take a group of people talking


---------105:58----------
about porn addiction and you stick that


---------106:00----------
on YouTube and you expect you know just


---------106:03----------
the cesspool of the cessful like for all


---------106:08----------
the people who live in the cesspool


---------106:09----------
you go into their septic tank and that's


---------106:11----------
what it should create yeah and yet


---------106:14----------
somehow something something very strange


---------106:16----------
is happening here that you guys are


---------106:17----------
talking about some really dark and bad


---------106:19----------
[ __ ] right you're talking about being


---------106:22----------
tornadoes of destruction for the people


---------106:24----------
around you you guys are talking about


---------106:26----------
gas lighting and abuse and you know


---------106:29----------
being angry and suicidal and and nearly


---------106:32----------
dying and you know walking to death's


---------106:34----------
door and cracking it open a little bit


---------106:37----------
and peeking through into seeing what's


---------106:39----------
on the other side and yet you all feel


---------106:42----------
ok you all feel good we've got ghosts


---------106:47----------
who's terrified that no one is ever


---------106:48----------
gonna understand him because he doesn't


---------106:50----------
understand himself and then like the


---------106:51----------
rest of us are just like scratching our


---------106:53----------
heads were like we get you dude like we


---------106:54----------
understand who you are


---------106:56----------
and it's it's so confusing to him and I


---------107:01----------
I mean I'm sure that all of you guys are


---------107:03----------
really good at bullshitting I'm sure all


---------107:06----------
of you guys are really good at lying but


---------107:09----------
I also think that y'all are really good


---------107:10----------
at sniffing out other people's [ __ ]


---------107:12----------
and I think if there was someone who's


---------107:14----------
both bullshitting in here we would be


---------107:15----------
able to sniff him out pretty quick you


---------107:17----------
can't create what's happening here if


---------107:19----------
there's someone who's full of [ __ ] right


---------107:24----------
so there's something really like special


---------107:26----------
going on and by the way we're supposed


---------107:28----------
to be talking about relationships so I'm


---------107:30----------
gonna switch back there so I'm gonna


---------107:36----------
quickly I think I'm gonna pat ourselves


---------107:38----------
on the back because you know the reason


---------107:41----------
I think the reason why the cesspool of


---------107:43----------
YouTube comments were positive is


---------107:46----------
because when when you can own who you


---------107:50----------
are it's respectable it means you have


---------107:52----------
you know you have balls you know so I


---------107:55----------
think it's that's why I think I love you


---------107:59----------
guys because you guys own it too and


---------108:01----------
then we're doing it together so yeah


---------108:03----------
that's that's a win for me yeah man Tony


---------108:08----------
thanks for your repeated suppose are at


---------108:09----------
the positivity dude sometimes I want to


---------108:13----------
be a therapist too but uh I guess my


---------108:16----------
moving lot moves on I think you'd be


---------108:19----------
good at attorney


---------108:22----------
you're like a calming presence so I just


---------108:29----------
want to acknowledge a couple things one


---------108:30----------
is that you know so we've had some


---------108:32----------
supposed to topics that we're supposed


---------108:34----------
to talk about but I just want to point


---------108:35----------
out that we're like kind of all over the


---------108:37----------
place but I don't think it's really that


---------108:39----------
we're all over the place I think it's


---------108:41----------
just that like things are not things


---------108:44----------
don't stay in their buckets so what when


---------108:48----------
I when I when I hear you guys talk about


---------108:50----------
relationships what I really hear is


---------108:51----------
there's themes of fear first of all and


---------108:54----------
most predominantly and secondly like


---------108:57----------
like being afraid of like hurting other


---------108:59----------
people and probably something about you


---------109:03----------
don't want to subject people to the


---------109:05----------
person that you are


---------109:09----------
I'm hearing that as well and you know in


---------109:13----------
the case of you know I think this


---------109:14----------
applies to I'm not getting that from


---------109:16----------
Bayer which i think is completely fine


---------109:18----------
so I don't think everyone has to have


---------109:19----------
the same experience but I think it bears


---------109:21----------
case it sounds like he was just really


---------109:22----------
in a toxic relationship and it sounds


---------109:25----------
like you guys have all had toxic


---------109:27----------
relationships and also you know what I


---------109:30----------
am I don't know if I'm really surprised


---------109:33----------
by this or not but like a lot of times


---------109:36----------
when we think about gamers or people on


---------109:39----------
Twitter like our people like the problem


---------109:42----------
is not that the relationships are full


---------109:44----------
of hurt or fear or pain or toxicity it's


---------109:47----------
that they just can't find them and so


---------109:49----------
I'm in that group you want to share a


---------109:53----------
little bit about what that's been like


---------109:54----------
oh I kind of just did this self but now


---------109:59----------
I'm kind of zoning out because I kind of


---------110:01----------
put all my attention on the superhero


---------110:04----------
complex we're trying to trying to kind


---------110:07----------
of digest it have you yeah I'm


---------110:11----------
definitely level one in that arena and I


---------110:15----------
I definitely want to be that perfect guy


---------110:18----------
going into it so um I understand that


---------110:21----------
now so I just accept the reality that


---------110:24----------
I'm just level one and that I've also


---------110:26----------
haven't looked for any relationship so


---------110:30----------
you know I can't complain it's just


---------110:32----------
something I might got to yet so that's


---------110:33----------
that's where I'm at and yeah so I'm just


---------110:39----------
trying to think about because we're


---------110:40----------
gonna have to wrap up it a little bit if


---------110:41----------
there's something that we can try to


---------110:43----------
like tie together or take home about


---------110:47----------
relationships and I realize we haven't


---------110:48----------
really done it justice so I was gonna


---------110:51----------
just kind of you know so we can do a


---------110:53----------
couple things and I'll leave it to you


---------110:54----------
guys to decide we can just kind of


---------110:55----------
continue to talk sort of open forum


---------110:57----------
because I think there's a lot of value


---------110:58----------
and we're uncovering a lot or what we


---------111:01----------
can do is you know pick one or two


---------111:03----------
things to try to like probably one thing


---------111:05----------
to explore and really come away with


---------111:08----------
some sense of understanding about like


---------111:09----------
how that one thing works what do you


---------111:12----------
guys think would be a better use of our


---------111:13----------
time


---------111:16----------
maybe focus on the one thing I think the


---------111:19----------
one thing and he is usually the one


---------111:23----------
thing tends to be just a mindset or


---------111:24----------
recognizing or be mindful of a state


---------111:28----------
that we're in I want to tie it down to a


---------111:30----------
practice so that we stick to that one


---------111:32----------
thing and that we embody that one thing


---------111:35----------
over and over again or that we you know


---------111:38----------
mitigate any triggers that remove us


---------111:40----------
from that one thing okay you know yeah I


---------111:43----------
got very practical mmm take away tying


---------111:48----------
to that one thing okay yeah sure so I'm


---------111:50----------
a fan of trying to keep things practical


---------111:53----------
as well so I'd like to offer something


---------111:54----------
for our one thing which is that why do


---------111:57----------
you feel like you need to be perfect can


---------111:59----------
we understand why you feel like you need


---------112:01----------
to be level 100 before you enter a


---------112:03----------
relationship and what does that do to


---------112:06----------
you what does that do to your prospects


---------112:07----------
for a relationship like where does that


---------112:09----------
come from


---------112:10----------
what do you guys think about that is a


---------112:12----------
topic I think that's a good topic does


---------112:19----------
anybody else have suggestions for what


---------112:21----------
to talk about works for me so let's


---------112:27----------
start with so why do you guys where does


---------112:30----------
that feeling so you guys so who here


---------112:32----------
feels like they want to be someone else


---------112:35----------
before they engage in a relationship my


---------112:41----------
caveat is


---------112:41----------
I just want to be myself again once I


---------112:44----------
could be myself again can I know I've


---------112:46----------
been there like once I'm myself then I


---------112:48----------
know it can be a pretty decent guy but


---------112:51----------
there's just thing I just I'm in a


---------112:53----------
situation where I'm not for myself okay


---------112:56----------
so why do you guys what is it that you


---------112:59----------
want to be before you enter a


---------113:01----------
relationship successful the idea why is


---------113:09----------
it important to be what what if you were


---------113:11----------
successful bear what would that change


---------113:15----------
about how you approach relationships it


---------113:19----------
would change my mentality of status and


---------113:21----------
how I would value myself and how I feel


---------113:25----------
like other people would would value me


---------113:28----------
uh-huh how would you change how would it


---------113:31----------
change how you value yourself


---------113:32----------
I could reflect on all the there it'd be


---------113:39----------
easier for me to reflect on all the good


---------113:41----------
that I've done knowing that it's it's


---------113:43----------
actually viable it's a versus what I


---------113:47----------
have now


---------113:48----------
okay and how would that change your


---------113:51----------
perception of how other people would see


---------113:54----------
you well I'm I'm heavily influenced by


---------113:58----------
how people see me


---------113:59----------
and the way they see me now is not I


---------114:03----------
guess not the best and then once I get


---------114:06----------
to that that point success surely the


---------114:09----------
that view would change but there's no I


---------114:11----------
guess a hundred percent confidence


---------114:13----------
behind that what what do you mean by not


---------114:15----------
the best how do they see you now


---------114:18----------
uh I just graduated no job just kind of


---------114:22----------
sitting at home playing video games do


---------114:24----------
nothing so how do they see what does


---------114:28----------
that mean unsuccessful I guess when you


---------114:34----------
guys think about how do you get okay so


---------114:38----------
let's just leave it at that so I'm gonna


---------114:40----------
ask a couple other people right so


---------114:42----------
Richard what would you like to be before


---------114:45----------
you enter into a relationship I get this


---------114:56----------
sense that I'm not sure I I would love


---------115:06----------
to be in a relationship it's just I


---------115:10----------
don't I don't know I'm not sure I'm no


---------115:15----------
I'm just level zero at this point


---------115:17----------
good answer so I think if you're not if


---------115:21----------
you're not sure about something you


---------115:23----------
should just say that so I'm gonna just


---------115:24----------
bounce around because I'm gonna try to


---------115:25----------
pull out themes okay so ghosts what


---------115:28----------
would you like to be different before


---------115:29----------
you enter a relationship I'm kind of


---------115:35----------
thinking of two different answers okay


---------115:40----------
one of them is whole but that reminds me


---------115:45----------
of when you were talking to reckful


---------115:48----------
about borderline personality disorder


---------115:50----------
that it's like it's hard to it's like


---------115:54----------
the whole kind of comes after but I'm


---------115:57----------
not sure I want to subject someone to


---------116:00----------
myself when I'm not whole and then


---------116:03----------
there's another part of me that's saying


---------116:04----------
I'm not even sure that I want to be in a


---------116:08----------
relationship because I feel like I'm so


---------116:09----------
I never want to be tied down to anything


---------116:15----------
because it makes me feel trapped and I


---------116:18----------
always want to be able to take flight if


---------116:22----------
I need to


---------116:24----------
but maybe that's something really


---------116:26----------
unhealthy and maybe that's rooted in


---------116:28----------
something yeah that's how I feel what


---------116:36----------
have you felt trapped before yeah


---------116:42----------
yeah quite a lot I kind of um I'm


---------116:47----------
realizing that I'm really good at


---------116:49----------
setting boundaries without even


---------116:53----------
realizing like I just don't let people


---------116:55----------
in because I I like unless they're


---------116:58----------
strangers on I don't like syrup


---------117:03----------
yeah I don't know what that is I feel


---------117:06----------
like it feels like there's a part of me


---------117:08----------
that's dominant all of the time and then


---------117:10----------
the part of me that's not dominant seize


---------117:13----------
this opportunity and it's like well if


---------117:15----------
there's gonna be one opportunity like


---------117:17----------
this is the time to strike and regain


---------117:19----------
control of myself


---------117:20----------
okay um yeah it feels like I'm I don't


---------117:24----------
know that I want to surrender control to


---------117:28----------
another person I like to be in control


---------117:30----------
of my own life and I feel like I had a


---------117:33----------
really mmm okay someone I know will be


---------117:39----------
watching this but I don't care I'm gonna


---------117:41----------
say I had a really abusive upbringing


---------117:43----------
and I had like really severe sort of


---------117:49----------
like strict like tyranny I guess and


---------117:53----------
that's sort of always fueled this need


---------117:56----------
to feel free and I just I can't feel


---------118:00----------
trapped because it's the worst thing in


---------118:01----------
the world to me and I'd rather have


---------118:04----------
nothing and be free than have something


---------118:06----------
and be trapped sure


---------118:09----------
Tony you said that you want to be


---------118:12----------
yourself again can you help us


---------118:13----------
understand who you are now and how


---------118:16----------
you're different from yourself yeah


---------118:20----------
sometimes like like go said like when if


---------118:25----------
he's if he feels whole again then you


---------118:28----------
know he'd be it'd be all right it I


---------118:32----------
think in relationship or it may be more


---------118:34----------
open to the idea of being with [ __ ] when


---------118:36----------
he's whole because for me it's like I


---------118:38----------
don't like it when I try to hide parts


---------118:40----------
of myself you know I have my weaknesses


---------118:43----------
or hide my mistakes or hide little


---------118:46----------
things that I'm not proud of I don't I


---------118:49----------
don't like the sense of hiding so once I


---------118:53----------
and once I can overcome those things


---------118:55----------
that I'm trying to hide that I don't


---------118:59----------
need to hide anymore right then I could


---------119:01----------
just be me absolutely authentic yeah


---------119:04----------
free you know and and I I want to be


---------119:08----------
free you know as opposed to be being was


---------119:11----------
called chained down to little petty bits


---------119:14----------
with shame whether they're petty or


---------119:18----------
deep-rooted and I just want to be free


---------119:20----------
and like she'll be me you know you could


---------119:23----------
probably enough yeah that's me yeah so


---------119:26----------
the first thing that I want to say is


---------119:28----------
that you know I'm just really surprised


---------119:32----------
by how reasonable when everyone else


---------119:33----------
what everyone is saying is right


---------119:36----------
maybe surprise isn't really the right


---------119:38----------
word but like I just want to acknowledge


---------119:39----------
because I think it's significant that


---------119:40----------
you know these are not these are very


---------119:44----------
real challenges that you guys face real


---------119:47----------
experiences that you all have had this


---------119:50----------
is not like some kind of cognitive bias


---------119:53----------
this is I mean there may be elements of


---------119:55----------
depression and stuff like that but you


---------119:56----------
know when we're dealing with something


---------119:57----------
like depression or anxiety like the


---------119:59----------
basic problem is that the thoughts that


---------120:01----------
your mind has are wrong right so like if


---------120:04----------
you have social anxiety and you think


---------120:06----------
everyone hates you like that's a wrong


---------120:08----------
thought


---------120:09----------
the first thing that I kind of want to


---------120:11----------
acknowledge is that I don't think that


---------120:12----------
they're like wrong thoughts here I think


---------120:14----------
each of what you guys want before you're


---------120:17----------
ready for a relationship


---------120:18----------
is very like legitimate and real right


---------120:22----------
this isn't pathology on your part it's


---------120:25----------
just you wanting to be in a different


---------120:26----------
place in your life now I think there are


---------120:30----------
a couple of things that I would I'm just


---------120:35----------
gonna start talking if that's okay


---------120:37----------
because we've got about maybe 5 to 10


---------120:38----------
minutes left the first thing is I think


---------120:40----------
all of you guys are thinking that in


---------120:42----------
order for you to have the perfect


---------120:44----------
relationship you have to be the perfect


---------120:45----------
person and I think the subtle thing that


---------120:49----------
has been unsaid all along here is that


---------120:52----------
what y'all are looking for is a perfect


---------120:53----------
relationship right because you're


---------120:58----------
envisioning that if you are a certain


---------121:00----------
way then the relationship is going to be


---------121:03----------
a certain way you guys see that y'all


---------121:11----------
think about that it's an unrealistic


---------121:14----------
expectation did you guys realize that


---------121:17----------
that was what your expectation was um


---------121:25----------
kind of it reminds me of a scene from


---------121:28----------
Good Will Hunting I don't know if


---------121:30----------
anyone's seen it but like there's a


---------121:34----------
scene where the main character is saying


---------121:35----------
that he doesn't want to call it go back


---------121:37----------
because right now in his head she's


---------121:39----------
perfect then he doesn't want to find out


---------121:41----------
and ruin it and then his therapist says


---------121:44----------
maybe you're perfect to her right now


---------121:45----------
and then he says it's not a matter of


---------121:47----------
whether you're perfect or she's perfect


---------121:48----------
but whether or not you're perfect for


---------121:50----------
each other


---------121:50----------
and whether or not you click with your


---------121:52----------
imperfections so maybe that's like the


---------121:56----------
most authentic thing you can hope for


---------121:58----------
yeah so I think the the subtle thing


---------122:01----------
here is that you guys are wanting to be


---------122:03----------
perfect because you're envisioning so


---------122:05----------
like you're envisioning this perfect


---------122:07----------
relationship and for that perfect


---------122:08----------
relationship to succeed you have to be a


---------122:11----------
particular thing


---------122:13----------
right that's what you're really because


---------122:16----------
you're saying like okay I'm there's this


---------122:18----------
thing in my there's this fantasy in my


---------122:19----------
mind and unless I am that thing I'm


---------122:21----------
going to screw it up this is cue all the


---------122:25----------
thoughts about I am a tornado of death


---------122:27----------
and I hurt I don't want to hurt other


---------122:30----------
people if I'm not confident in myself I


---------122:33----------
may be attracting the wrong kind of


---------122:35----------
person who's narcissistic and gaslight


---------122:36----------
me and all that kind of [ __ ] you know


---------122:38----------
like there are all of these like


---------122:39----------
reasonable thoughts that are ending up


---------122:43----------
with this sort of like flawed premise


---------122:44----------
that you guys are looking for a perfect


---------122:46----------
relationship and for the record I don't


---------122:49----------
I don't know that you guys are ready for


---------122:51----------
a real relationship yet but I do think


---------122:54----------
that it's important to remember that you


---------122:57----------
know good relationships in my opinion


---------122:59----------
are defined not because the people that


---------123:01----------
like the good relationships are not the


---------123:03----------
ones that people and enter into when


---------123:05----------
they're perfect the good relationship is


---------123:07----------
the one where the person that you're


---------123:08----------
with helps you become the starting point


---------123:12----------
that you guys are looking for that's a


---------123:15----------
good relationship right so like I can


---------123:18----------
relate a lot to what Baer was saying


---------123:20----------
personally because my relationship


---------123:22----------
started when I was in no one and and


---------123:26----------
thankfully my wife like stuck with me


---------123:29----------
like so we started dating when I was a


---------123:30----------
junior in college and then you know I


---------123:33----------
graduated after five years in college


---------123:36----------
and then for the next four years like


---------123:39----------
she continued to stick with me even


---------123:41----------
though she had many better options and I


---------123:45----------
wasn't making any money I wasn't you


---------123:47----------
know I was just a guy who graduated


---------123:49----------
three years ago with a biology degree in


---------123:51----------
a 2.5 GPA like that's a no one in life


---------123:54----------
like that like you know bear just


---------123:57----------
graduated it's just like three years


---------123:59----------
later I'm exactly where Bear is today


---------124:01----------
and and she's stuck with me and so you


---------124:06----------
know was she perfect absolutely not was


---------124:08----------
I perfect absolutely not


---------124:10----------
and so I'd encourage you guys to think a


---------124:12----------
little bit about you know when you are


---------124:14----------
trying to be this perfect person because


---------124:16----------
you don't want to hurt people this once


---------124:18----------
again is like as you guys said that's


---------124:20----------
evasion tanking right so I think part of


---------124:22----------
what a relationship a good relationship


---------124:23----------
is about is that you actually do


---------124:27----------
hurt other people like that's something


---------124:28----------
you have to accept from the get-go and


---------124:30----------
that other people are gonna hurt you


---------124:32----------
the question is what happens when


---------124:35----------
someone takes damage you know do they do


---------124:41----------
they Gaslight everyone around you -


---------124:44----------
dogpile you and make you feel like a


---------124:46----------
piece of [ __ ] that's a relationship that


---------124:48----------
needs to end


---------124:49----------
or do they apologize and like try to


---------124:51----------
help you grow and try to grow themselves


---------124:53----------
are they willing to stick with you while


---------124:58----------
you're exploring all the layers to your


---------125:00----------
own onion because you don't know who you


---------125:02----------
are and be sort of a stable force are


---------125:05----------
they willing to be patient with you


---------125:07----------
while you figure your own [ __ ] out which


---------125:09----------
I'm eternally grateful to my wife


---------125:10----------
because she was I didn't know who the


---------125:12----------
[ __ ] I was and she was like kind of okay


---------125:15----------
with that and and so I think the last


---------125:18----------
thing to understand is that you guys are


---------125:20----------
striving to be perfect before you enter


---------125:22----------
this relationship you want to be level


---------125:23----------
100 but you're actually setting like a


---------125:27----------
very dangerous expectation for the other


---------125:29----------
person which is to expect perfection


---------125:32----------
from you that's a relationship that's


---------125:34----------
gonna fail because this Thunder this set


---------125:37----------
is up here yeah so then when you fall


---------125:40----------
below it you're not meeting your own


---------125:41----------
standards absolutely it's gonna be false


---------125:44----------
advertising too because you guys are


---------125:45----------
never gonna be level 100 it's just not


---------125:48----------
gonna happen


---------125:49----------
you can also like a full buck you could


---------125:52----------
even go back they can release expansions


---------125:54----------
and raise the level cap that's actually


---------125:58----------
what happens right so as you get better


---------126:00----------
you become


---------126:01----------
I mean dissatisfaction has nothing to do


---------126:04----------
with where you are in life like I work


---------126:06----------
with people that are wildly successful


---------126:08----------
and equally dissatisfied is like you


---------126:11----------
know the people I work with on you know


---------126:14----------
on twitch like gamers and average people


---------126:18----------
and neat people like any et people and


---------126:21----------
stuff like that it's all it's all about


---------126:22----------
attitude and self-satisfaction


---------126:25----------
so I'd really encourage you guys to


---------126:27----------
think a lot about this idea of like you


---------126:28----------
know I want to be perfect before I enter


---------126:30----------
a relationship so I think it like I said


---------126:32----------
so the first thing is it comes from a


---------126:34----------
very normal place that you guys really


---------126:36----------
do want to make some changes about


---------126:38----------
yourself I think all of the things that


---------126:40----------
you guys want to accomplish are


---------126:41----------
reasonable goals the only issue that I


---------126:44----------
take is that just because you haven't


---------126:46----------
met those goals doesn't mean that you're


---------126:48----------
not ready for a relationship actually I


---------126:50----------
mean you're not ready but that doesn't


---------126:52----------
mean that it isn't a good idea the last


---------126:55----------
thing is I don't think you need to be


---------126:56----------
right I mean I [ __ ] wasn't ready for


---------126:58----------
a relationship do you think you can ever


---------127:00----------
really be ready


---------127:01----------
no and this goes this goes back to the


---------127:04----------
idea of you can only be what you are


---------127:06----------
right so the last thing that I'm gonna


---------127:08----------
leave you guys with is something even


---------127:10----------
more confusing a little bit spiritual


---------127:12----------
which is the concept of Karma


---------127:13----------
so your karma did I mean so you guys


---------127:17----------
don't have to believe this but just just


---------127:19----------
to think about it so I I don't think


---------127:21----------
about karma as being right or wrong I


---------127:23----------
think about it as a framework that can


---------127:25----------
help us understand certain things about


---------127:27----------
our life so like we were each given a


---------127:31----------
hand of cards to play the game of life


---------127:33----------
and that's our Karma I'm not saying it


---------127:35----------
was determined by God or anything like


---------127:37----------
that I'm just saying that our


---------127:38----------
circumstances are unique and our


---------127:40----------
circumstances form us into the people


---------127:41----------
that we are today and so you guys can't


---------127:45----------
be anything but what you were so ghost


---------127:47----------
has this issue about feeling trapped


---------127:49----------
because you grew up in a tyrannical


---------127:50----------
household like you can't undo that you


---------127:53----------
don't get to re-roll right so that's


---------127:57----------
just what you deal with


---------127:59----------
that's your karma and also to understand


---------128:02----------
that you can't expect yourself to be


---------128:05----------
free of that you can't hold yourself to


---------128:08----------
a standard of not being paranoid to


---------128:11----------
being trapped because that's what you


---------128:12----------
[ __ ] are you're paranoid of being


---------128:13----------
trapped so be it that's the hand that


---------128:16----------
you were dealt that's your karma so play


---------128:18----------
that hand it doesn't mean that you can't


---------128:20----------
win the game


---------128:21----------
and so whether it's a couple of


---------128:24----------
near-death experiences a narcissistic


---------128:27----------
partner who gaslighted everyone around


---------128:29----------
you you know non-ideal modeling for what


---------128:33----------
a relationship looks like or a fear of


---------128:35----------
being trapped and paranoid or even not


---------128:37----------
even knowing what you want from a


---------128:38----------
relationship because your level zero all


---------128:40----------
of those are your gut Irma's those are


---------128:43----------
your unique set of circumstances you


---------128:45----------
can't be anything but what you are


---------128:48----------
because that's the hand that you were


---------128:50----------
given and you've made choices in the


---------128:52----------
past but just because those choices were


---------128:54----------
a mistake before doesn't change the fact


---------128:57----------
that you made those mistakes and you


---------128:59----------
have to deal with that [ __ ] today right


---------129:02----------
so you like even today every day you


---------129:04----------
have the hand of cards that you sort of


---------129:06----------
determined the day before and the day


---------129:07----------
before the day before and you can regret


---------129:09----------
playing that hand a particular way but


---------129:11----------
you still have to deal with the


---------129:12----------
aftermath of who you are today which is


---------129:14----------
imperfect


---------129:15----------
and not ready and completely ok thoughts


---------129:30----------
or questions before we wrap up I was


---------129:33----------
just a quick question on that yeah so


---------129:40----------
the conversation was unraveling I saw


---------129:43----------
myself really pushing forward to an idea


---------129:48----------
of like a perfect loving family like two


---------129:50----------
kids is uh is that a perfect


---------129:53----------
relationship or is it is I guess my main


---------129:56----------
question is is there a difference


---------129:58----------
between loving and perfect what do you


---------130:02----------
guys think so is that like a good a good


---------130:09----------
pursuit a good goal a good maybe maybe


---------130:13----------
that's not the right link so I'm gonna


---------130:16----------
sort of turn that question on its head I


---------130:18----------
think what's perfect is what is


---------130:21----------
right so like if you walk outside and


---------130:23----------
you look at a flower that flower cannot


---------130:26----------
be anything but what it is it can't be


---------130:28----------
in a different place it can't be a


---------130:29----------
different color so if you really look at


---------130:32----------
it from a yogic perspective the idea of


---------130:34----------
perfection is just a false thing because


---------130:36----------
the only thing that is is what is you


---------130:40----------
can't stop making it rain you can't you


---------130:44----------
know change the person that you are so


---------130:47----------
in a sense you are perfect


---------130:50----------
so is it like don't concern yourself


---------130:53----------
with that which you can't control like


---------130:56----------
just release any ideas about something


---------130:59----------
that's out of your control completely


---------131:01----------
yeah so just be the person that you are


---------131:03----------
and do the best that you can and in


---------131:07----------
terms of having goals I think generally


---------131:09----------
speaking we have goals when we have very


---------131:11----------
little information right so my


---------131:13----------
perception of what good and healthy


---------131:15----------
marriage is like when I started out I


---------131:18----------
had no clue and I think one of the


---------131:20----------
biggest mistakes that people make is


---------131:21----------
they like they come up with checklists


---------131:23----------
right they're like I want my partner to


---------131:25----------
be a B and C and generally speaking the


---------131:28----------
more that they adhere to the checklist


---------131:30----------
just what I've seen in terms of you know


---------131:31----------
my friends and people who are my age who


---------131:33----------
get married and don't get married and


---------131:34----------
end up in happy relationships and don't


---------131:36----------
end up in happy relationships is the


---------131:38----------
people who are obsessed with checklists


---------131:39----------
and like meeting a certain standard are


---------131:42----------
the ones who tend to get divorced or not


---------131:44----------
be married


---------131:45----------
it's the people who actually like just


---------131:48----------
about every relationship so when I work


---------131:51----------
with people you know in in my practice I


---------131:53----------
see a lot of healthy relationships and


---------131:55----------
all of them are like deeply flawed at


---------131:57----------
the very beginning it's like people


---------131:59----------
getting together with people that they


---------132:01----------
really should not get together with


---------132:04----------
right so like you know asking an 18 year


---------132:09----------
old to marry you when you work at


---------132:10----------
Chili's seems like a terrible idea


---------132:14----------
and it is a terrible idea but bizarrely


---------132:18----------
enough girl's parents were okay with it


---------132:20----------
and they're like happily married now


---------132:23----------
what is this something like eighteen


---------132:26----------
years later right so like don't expect


---------132:30----------
don't set up in your mind what a perfect


---------132:33----------
person or perfect relationship looks


---------132:35----------
like because you just don't know like


---------132:36----------
well the perfect relationship is the one


---------132:38----------
that's right for you


---------132:39----------
and that that one you know I think


---------132:43----------
you'll know it when you see it but you


---------132:45----------
have to give yourself a chance the one


---------132:47----------
thing that I would encourage you guys to


---------132:48----------
do is just if you're not ready for a


---------132:50----------
relationship that's completely


---------132:51----------
reasonable you know if you have some


---------132:53----------
stuff that you want to work on stuff


---------132:54----------
like that but I was I mean I started I


---------132:56----------
met my wife when I was convinced I was


---------132:58----------
gonna become a monk and be celibate for


---------132:59----------
the rest of my life so that was just


---------133:01----------
terrible I mean was a terrible idea for


---------133:03----------
everyone involved


---------133:04----------
and you were confused yeah I got


---------133:07----------
confused and it was great


---------133:08----------
like I'm so glad cuz man I just I if


---------133:12----------
that had not happened I would not have


---------133:14----------
recognized the depth of my idiocy and


---------133:17----------
that has gotten me to appreciate so much


---------133:20----------
about how stupid human beings can


---------133:22----------
actually be and it also gives me


---------133:24----------
compassion for the dumbest human beings


---------133:26----------
on the planet which allows me to talk to


---------133:30----------
people on Twitch


---------133:34----------
cuz that's usually yeah if you hadn't


---------133:40----------
met your wife and you had become a monk


---------133:42----------
do you think you would have lived a


---------133:45----------
happy life and that version of you would


---------133:47----------
now still be glad of making that choice


---------133:51----------
I do you think you just have to accept


---------133:53----------
whichever path you end up taking I think


---------133:56----------
there's only one path okay right so I


---------134:03----------
here's our meditation practice for the


---------134:05----------
day so we can do mula bandha again you


---------134:07----------
guys remember mula bandha yeah so mula


---------134:11----------
bandha is so we're gonna contract the


---------134:14----------
perineum which you guys can you know try


---------134:17----------
this at home if you want to but


---------134:19----------
okay so mula bandha is is so Tony and


---------134:23----------
bare so you guys know how to flex your


---------134:25----------
penis up so go ahead and pull that


---------134:29----------
muscle and notice when you pull that


---------134:31----------
muscle that your anus contracts this I'm


---------134:35----------
not trawling you guys seriously it's


---------134:36----------
just it's really not trolling you kegels


---------134:39----------
right giggles yeah kegels exactly


---------134:41----------
so basically mula bandha is contracting


---------134:44----------
that muscle for a period of like three


---------134:46----------
to five seconds and then relaxing and


---------134:48----------
then contracting and relaxing so let's


---------134:52----------
practice so contract one two three and


---------134:57----------
relax and then contract again one two


---------135:02----------
three relax


---------135:07----------
contract one two three


---------135:11----------
relax good so continue practicing for


---------135:15----------
let's say another thirty Seconds good so


---------135:30----------
I have another meditation practice for


---------135:32----------
you guys so this one that's a little bit


---------135:34----------
more contemplative this is gonna sound


---------135:38----------
kind of weird but I want you guys to go


---------135:39----------
outside and look at a plant and then ask


---------135:43----------
yourself is that plant perfect


---------135:50----------
and could that plant be anything else


---------135:54----------
and I know you can think of an answer as


---------135:57----------
you sit here and you imagine the


---------135:59----------
scenario but part of a meditative


---------136:01----------
practices actually go outside and look


---------136:03----------
at it and contemplate it and use that


---------136:08----------
sensory experience okay


---------136:14----------
how you guys feeling good tom you guys


---------136:22----------
how do you all feel about your future


---------136:26----------
confident


---------136:29----------
ghosts are you ever gonna get to the


---------136:31----------
bottom of the onion shark huh Shrek I


---------136:40----------

---------136:45----------

---------136:49----------
take the stuff Sunday - right yep the


---------136:52----------
only steps you can't take one layer at a


---------136:54----------
time one layer at a time


---------136:57----------
now I'll build donkey that'll do so


---------137:02----------
he'll do I don't have you know specific


---------137:06----------
questions for each and every one of you


---------137:07----------
but I think let me just see what I can


---------137:10----------
pull out so if for Aaron I guess my


---------137:11----------
question is is death inevitable are you


---------137:14----------
gonna drown be honest one day in the


---------137:22----------
very very very far future well when the


---------137:27----------
time is right but when the time is right


---------137:30----------
perfect time because there's only one


---------137:33----------
thought yeah I have too many things too


---------137:36----------
many ambitions good so try to


---------137:40----------
trying to fulfill what you can and then


---------137:42----------
you'll learn how to let go of the rest


---------137:45----------
dr. K can I ask you a question was there


---------137:49----------
anything that you wanted you noticed


---------137:52----------
that you were there any questions that


---------137:55----------
weren't that we didn't have time for


---------137:58----------
that you wanted to bring up just so


---------138:00----------
yelling a thousand but I think that's


---------138:02----------
okay right so I I think we we got to the


---------138:06----------
questions that we needed to today and I


---------138:10----------
have Rosen ambitions as well I have all


---------138:13----------
kinds of things that I jotted down that


---------138:15----------
I wanted to ask you guys about and what


---------138:18----------
do you know those we didn't have time


---------138:20----------
for those those questions are


---------138:22----------
unfulfilled we may never get to them and


---------138:27----------
yet this conversation was perfect it's


---------138:31----------
what it needed to be and you guys are


---------138:33----------
what you need to be and that's that's


---------138:37----------
just how it works so take comfort in the


---------138:38----------
fact that that's just that's how it


---------138:40----------
works guys we couldn't have asked any


---------138:43----------
more questions and we couldn't have


---------138:45----------
asked any fewer we asked them you'd go


---------138:47----------
insane if you tried to change like if


---------138:51----------
you try to really focus on those things


---------138:53----------
and didn't just see it as perfect as is


---------138:55----------
very well said ghost why the [ __ ] do you


---------138:58----------
think everyone is going crazy because


---------139:02----------
that


---------139:02----------
which you try to like that's what you


---------139:03----------
try to do in your life right just think


---------139:05----------
about that for a second you try to salt


---------139:07----------
you try to ask all the questions you try


---------139:09----------
to fulfill all the ambitions you try to


---------139:11----------
be the perfect person for a relationship


---------139:13----------
and then everyone goes insane like why


---------139:14----------
did why do you guys think this is so


---------139:16----------
successful on Twitch it's because


---------139:18----------
everyone is doing what goes to sync


---------139:22----------
right so the biggest problem with


---------139:24----------
mankind is that their ambition is


---------139:26----------
limitless and their capability is


---------139:28----------
limited if always like before more


---------139:31----------
change change change go out and see even


---------139:36----------
with with Tony it's like change I don't


---------139:39----------
need to change a whole lot I just need


---------139:41----------
to change a little bit still a problem


---------139:44----------
so go out and look at your plant and


---------139:47----------
good luck guys and yeah thank you very


---------139:54----------
much for coming on today thank you very


---------139:56----------

---------139:58----------

---------140:00----------

---------140:04----------

---------140:07----------

---------140:08----------

---------140:10----------

---------140:13----------

---------140:14----------
this is an invitational all right guys


---------140:18----------
take care


---------140:18----------
strong guys good luck everyone okay so


---------140:29----------
guys thank you very much for coming I


---------140:35----------
don't know how much of that people were


---------140:37----------
able to keep up with but yeah so I think


---------140:41----------
you know one thing that I just wanted to


---------140:42----------
say for a second is that I think that


---------140:44----------
this actually highlights a little bit


---------140:46----------
about why I think our coaching program


---------140:48----------
is like actually gonna be pretty good


---------140:50----------
because I think you know we have all


---------140:52----------
these problems that we think we have but


---------140:55----------
the solutions tend to be like a lot


---------140:57----------
wider and deeper and broader I think


---------141:01----------
things are related in in terms of our


---------141:03----------
mind and stuff and so my hope is that I


---------141:06----------
mean so my question is how do we help


---------141:10----------
people explore this kind of stuff and


---------141:12----------
and that's where I think like that my


---------141:13----------
hope is that the coaching program works


---------141:15----------
so we'll see


---------141:16----------
but you know if you guys are feeling


---------141:18----------
stuck in a particular area of your life


---------141:20----------
don't be so restrictive is to think that


---------141:24----------
the solution to that problem is like


---------141:27----------
fixing that problem when we talked about


---------141:30----------
relationships for example you know they


---------141:32----------
you know there are all kinds of there's


---------141:33----------
all kinds of relationship advice you can


---------141:35----------
give people I think the real challenge


---------141:37----------
is is in recognizing that you know what


---------141:39----------
these people are struggling with is like


---------141:41----------
fear of who they are and that they're


---------141:44----------
not going to be good enough in a


---------141:45----------
relationship for someone else


---------141:47----------
and they're not going to be good enough


---------141:49----------
in a relationship for someone else right


---------141:50----------
so successful relationships people grow


---------141:52----------
and learn how to get better at them so


---------141:56----------
you're not like I mean you start off


---------141:58----------
with low XP and then you like level up


---------142:00----------
with someone and if things worked out


---------142:02----------
then you guys like stay with them and


---------142:03----------
and that's great so if you guys think


---------142:07----------
that you know your problem is video game


---------142:09----------
addiction or your problem is this or


---------142:11----------
your problem is that like do yourself


---------142:13----------
the benefit do yourself the benefit of


---------142:16----------
digging a little bit deeper and seeing


---------142:18----------
if there's something related to it right


---------142:20----------
is this an issue of confidence is this


---------142:22----------
an issue of like you know I don't want


---------142:24----------
to be successful because even if I'm


---------142:26----------
successful I'm never going to live up to


---------142:28----------
the fantasy that I have in my mind


---------142:30----------
that's a big one that people are not


---------142:33----------
willing to they say oh I'm unemployed I


---------142:35----------
don't have a job I sit at home all day


---------142:37----------
and they can go out and get a job but


---------142:39----------
they don't want to get a job because the


---------142:40----------
job that they're gonna get is gonna be


---------142:41----------
shameful right it doesn't live up to


---------142:44----------
their standard like yeah I'm happy to be


---------142:46----------
an entrepreneur but I don't want to work


---------142:48----------
for someone else so be careful about


---------142:51----------
your ego and the standards that you set


---------142:53----------
yourself and what you believe is is your


---------142:55----------
problem and what you believe your


---------142:56----------
solution is because it may be very


---------142:58----------
different from what you think


---------143:02----------
so thank you guys very much thank you


---------143:05----------
