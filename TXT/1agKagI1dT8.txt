---------03:14----------
i hope to go again when all of our


---------03:16----------
lockdowns take you know


---------03:18----------
yeah and restrictions go down and how


---------03:20----------
long have you been in canada


---------03:22----------
uh my whole life really wow uh


---------03:26----------
i would say i would say like if you're


---------03:27----------
talking about me moving here probably


---------03:29----------
when i was less than a year old so


---------03:31----------
i wasn't i wasn't born up here in canada


---------03:33----------
but you know i'm


---------03:34----------
pretty much born canadian if you will


---------03:36----------
right


---------03:37----------
you know i'm surprised by how how


---------03:40----------
similar your accent sounds to people


---------03:42----------
down here


---------03:45----------
you know i i thought about that too for


---------03:47----------
a while when i lived in the states a


---------03:49----------
little bit uh the first i ever lived in


---------03:50----------
the states was michigan everyone told me


---------03:52----------
that i didn't sound canadian and i was


---------03:54----------
like what is the


---------03:55----------
what is the metric for sounding canadian


---------03:57----------
you know what i mean


---------03:58----------
and then i drove an hour up from where i


---------04:00----------
live and then i was like oh that's what


---------04:01----------
the real canadian sounds like okay


---------04:03----------
all right okay that's really off


---------04:07----------
so you said you moved here um you moved


---------04:09----------
to canada when you were a year old


---------04:11----------
from where yeah uh india you know


---------04:15----------
and what what part of india are your


---------04:17----------
parents from uh


---------04:19----------
my whole family is uh from luck now


---------04:21----------
utter pradesh uh


---------04:22----------
you got like half my family from luck


---------04:25----------
now and then you got half my family who


---------04:26----------
like


---------04:27----------
move to pakistan during the partition so


---------04:30----------
it's like it's just spread across the


---------04:32----------
board you know


---------04:33----------
okay um so i i have family back home but


---------04:37----------
i would say like


---------04:37----------
my side of the family where i'm from


---------04:39----------
were were indian


---------04:40----------
you know yeah got it and it was there


---------04:43----------
something in particular that you wanted


---------04:45----------
to talk about today muda


---------04:47----------
honestly uh as i mentioned this earlier


---------04:49----------
it's just the idea of the whole like


---------04:50----------
lockdowns on isolation it's just been


---------04:52----------
insane


---------04:53----------
the last from a canadian i think we've


---------04:56----------
had the worst lockdowns


---------04:58----------
uh when i look at all my american


---------05:00----------
friends right like they're able to go


---------05:01----------
out for like months on end and we've


---------05:02----------
been locked down for like six seven


---------05:04----------
months straight like the hardest


---------05:05----------
lockdowns no stores open


---------05:07----------
no nothing everything has been


---------05:09----------
completely curbside yeah uh


---------05:11----------
meeting family has been the hardest


---------05:14----------
because


---------05:14----------
you you know when you go to meet family


---------05:17----------
in canada during the lockdown


---------05:18----------
you have to you have to do what's known


---------05:21----------
as car tetris i guess where you have to


---------05:23----------
like park your cars in like


---------05:25----------
a block over so the police driving by


---------05:26----------
doesn't like notice like more than four


---------05:28----------
people are in a house meeting each other


---------05:30----------
despite them being family so it's been a


---------05:32----------
complete like everyone is stuck home


---------05:35----------
and the entire government sort of pushed


---------05:37----------
this just talk over zoom which


---------05:39----------
isn't the healthiest thing right like


---------05:41----------
you can't just sit over and hold on a


---------05:43----------
second if there are four


---------05:44----------
cars in a parking lot the police will


---------05:47----------
yeah if they if they notice more than


---------05:49----------
like two cars in a driveway they have


---------05:50----------
the idea that there's like a big


---------05:52----------
gathering in the area and then they just


---------05:53----------
come in and find you like crazy and it's


---------05:56----------
oh my god so they're just like police


---------05:57----------
like patrolling


---------05:59----------
your residential streets yeah


---------06:03----------
oh yeah well there was a there was a


---------06:04----------
point i think two months ago where they


---------06:06----------
gave like the


---------06:07----------
toronto like greater toronto area police


---------06:09----------
officers the right to just like


---------06:11----------
pull your car over on the drive like out


---------06:13----------
on the road


---------06:14----------
and they could pull you over and ask you


---------06:16----------
what you were doing and they could like


---------06:17----------
fine you i guess if you didn't get the


---------06:18----------
right answer


---------06:19----------
no cop ever enforced that all the police


---------06:21----------
chief said that was a bad idea so


---------06:24----------
that's where we were for a while in


---------06:26----------
canada at least


---------06:27----------
uh all while they didn't stop all the


---------06:29----------
international travel so


---------06:31----------
everyone from around the world just kept


---------06:32----------
coming in and we had to like you know


---------06:34----------
stay in our houses which


---------06:36----------
um i'm not like i'm not a doctor so i


---------06:38----------
don't want to like elaborate more on


---------06:39----------
that i'm sure there's a reason but like


---------06:41----------
you know it's just at some point it gets


---------06:44----------
too hard to deal with you know like


---------06:47----------
trying to meet your family i haven't


---------06:49----------
seen my family well now i've seen them


---------06:51----------
you know in the last several weeks but


---------06:52----------
there was a period where i was like okay


---------06:54----------
let's you know talk over the phone i


---------06:55----------
guess let's facetime each other and it


---------06:57----------
was


---------06:58----------
it was never the same because i took it


---------07:00----------
very much for granted before the


---------07:01----------
lockdown ever began


---------07:03----------
i was always like a solo guy like i was


---------07:05----------
always living you know on my own and


---------07:07----------
having a good time


---------07:08----------
but we would always go meet each other


---------07:09----------
over the weekends right like you know


---------07:10----------
dinners you know go out to eat and then


---------07:12----------
it's like for the last six months


---------07:14----------
there was like a period where they


---------07:15----------
stopped the lockdown for like 12 hours


---------07:18----------
and then they just started it up again


---------07:20----------
that same night so we had


---------07:22----------
we had lockdowns over six months i would


---------07:24----------
say and then it was just we were


---------07:26----------
yeah we were completely separated


---------07:27----------
hardcore in


---------07:29----------
in the province that i'm in what's that


---------07:31----------
been like for you


---------07:33----------
uh i would say the worst


---------07:36----------
i mean like i said it's it's something


---------07:39----------
that i definitely took for granted


---------07:41----------
hardcore and i'll never take it again


---------07:42----------
for granted after right like the last


---------07:44----------
time i could remember


---------07:45----------
going out for like a meal with friends


---------07:48----------
was like august of


---------07:49----------
2019 you know like that's what like 2019


---------07:53----------
is where like my last you know brain


---------07:55----------
kicks in like wow that was when uh


---------07:56----------
things were normal


---------07:58----------
and then i had a flight to texas you


---------08:01----------
know


---------08:01----------
because we had packed south with friends


---------08:03----------
and i went over there we had a good time


---------08:05----------
the moment i flew back january 2020 is


---------08:08----------
like when the whole lockdown started


---------08:09----------
ramping up and you know this whole


---------08:11----------
cobin 19 broke down and then


---------08:14----------
in home ever since you know work from


---------08:16----------
home


---------08:17----------
do nothing occasionally meeting friends


---------08:21----------
you know


---------08:21----------
once in a while but so other than that


---------08:24----------
when you say it's been rough like


---------08:26----------
in what way has it affected you


---------08:29----------
i i miss having people next to me you


---------08:32----------
know i miss having people over you know


---------08:33----------
even if it is just a talk right like


---------08:36----------
i have very like i would say minimal


---------08:39----------
social needs i don't need to go anywhere


---------08:40----------
you know what i mean i need to like


---------08:42----------
experience


---------08:42----------
the world in that you know traditional


---------08:44----------
way what most people expect


---------08:47----------
i i i i like to i like the concept of


---------08:50----------
having friends over even if it is just


---------08:51----------
to watch a movie over there to have a


---------08:53----------
drink or you know play a video game or


---------08:54----------
something


---------08:55----------
or have a barbecue over at my house like


---------08:58----------
before the whole


---------08:59----------
coronavirus i used to see my uh got


---------09:01----------
child every once in a while right like


---------09:03----------
we went over there we had a whole family


---------09:04----------
thing


---------09:05----------
uh it's been over a year since that's


---------09:07----------
happened and he's already grown up to


---------09:08----------
like


---------09:09----------
you know just like kids grow fast so now


---------09:11----------
it's just


---------09:12----------
oh wow it's been over a year i mean what


---------09:14----------
am i gonna do


---------09:17----------
and that's where we're at you know it's


---------09:19----------
it really sets


---------09:20----------
into stone how important it is to have


---------09:23----------
like an actual physical


---------09:24----------
connection and like be there to other


---------09:26----------
because you can't do it over the


---------09:27----------
internet like no matter what anyone says


---------09:29----------
you can't do you know zoom calls you


---------09:32----------
can't do


---------09:32----------
even when it comes to work right like


---------09:34----------
when it came to my job


---------09:37----------
we do like a small business over here so


---------09:39----------
we're like we're like a family right we


---------09:40----------
see each other in the office all the


---------09:41----------
time now that we're home


---------09:44----------
you know what the heck right like it's


---------09:45----------
all over the place you know even


---------09:47----------
even physical health-wise you know


---------09:49----------
whereas i used to go out and do


---------09:50----------
activities here and there now


---------09:52----------
because we're all locked in you know


---------09:53----------
what are you gonna do right like


---------09:55----------
your timings are all over the place what


---------09:57----------
what do you do


---------09:58----------
how do you spend your uh for me my


---------10:02----------
well i have a pretty strict schedule now


---------10:04----------
for work right like i start work at like


---------10:06----------
eight o'clock


---------10:07----------
i end it by 3 30 p.m like i used to a


---------10:10----------
year or two ago like i used to be


---------10:12----------
hardcore into that 24 hour no work life


---------10:15----------
balance which


---------10:16----------
completely threw me out for a loop right


---------10:18----------
it was the worst thing you can ever do


---------10:19----------
with your health


---------10:20----------
so now i have like this you know i wake


---------10:23----------
up early


---------10:24----------
finish you know sometime reasonably


---------10:26----------
before the sun goes down and then i go


---------10:27----------
out for a walk you know i


---------10:28----------
go out and you know run here and there


---------10:31----------
or


---------10:32----------
you know just breed some fresh air and


---------10:34----------
then by like seven o'clock i'll wind


---------10:36----------
down


---------10:36----------
and and muda can you just can we


---------10:38----------
actually rewind a little bit can you


---------10:40----------
tell me a little bit about what


---------10:41----------
growing up in canada was like and stuff


---------10:43----------
like that growing up in canada


---------10:47----------
is about i guess one could expect like i


---------10:50----------
mean i had a normal childhood i'm not


---------10:51----------
gonna i don't have like


---------10:52----------
wild stories but i'll say as an indian


---------10:54----------
kid growing up post 9 11 that's


---------10:57----------
the one thing that i would remember the


---------10:59----------
hardest a lot of people make canada out


---------11:01----------
like it's this


---------11:02----------
crazy multicultural loving society and


---------11:05----------
that's true for


---------11:06----------
you know 95 of the scenarios but when


---------11:08----------
you're the only indian kid growing up


---------11:10----------
after you know


---------11:11----------
what is one of the greatest north


---------11:13----------
american tragedies you know


---------11:15----------
there's going to be a lot of people who


---------11:16----------
look at you and in a way


---------11:18----------
that whole experience probably shaped me


---------11:20----------
into the person that i am


---------11:21----------
because i've always said this on stream


---------11:23----------
right like when i went through


---------11:25----------
that period of you know being bullied


---------11:27----------
for being isolated based on you know


---------11:30----------
who i was i could either absolutely you


---------11:33----------
know


---------11:34----------
let this ruin me or i could just you


---------11:37----------
know hunker down


---------11:37----------
i could realize okay i can take this


---------11:40----------
adversity and i can you know channel it


---------11:41----------
and i can


---------11:42----------
turn it into a productive you know i i


---------11:45----------
can fight against it in a productive


---------11:46----------
manner and i feel like that's what i've


---------11:47----------
done now so it's


---------11:49----------
how do you do that uh work hard


---------11:52----------
you know back when i back as indian kids


---------11:55----------
growing up you know as asian kids your


---------11:56----------
parents always tell you about


---------11:58----------
how important it is you know to be good


---------12:00----------
at school you know you always got to get


---------12:01----------
a pluses you always got to do this you


---------12:02----------
always got to do that


---------12:03----------
and growing up in canada in that


---------12:06----------
environment


---------12:07----------
it's so much more important it's so much


---------12:09----------
stronger to realize that


---------12:11----------
the only way that you can prove your


---------12:14----------
worth in society right and at least this


---------12:16----------
is how i learned is


---------12:17----------
you have to get into the system and you


---------12:19----------
have to be the best of the best in the


---------12:21----------
system regardless of how much it is


---------12:22----------
stacked against you right so


---------12:24----------
i would say for an immigrant kid


---------12:26----------
literally an immigrant child


---------12:28----------
you know it's probably two times harder


---------12:30----------
than the average person you have to deal


---------12:32----------
with over here but


---------12:33----------
it is doable regardless of how much you


---------12:35----------
have to sacrifice in your life


---------12:37----------
and i've had to sacrifice you know high


---------12:38----------
school is when i pretty much started


---------12:39----------
working and only now at 27 am i winding


---------12:42----------
down my life


---------12:43----------
you know like only now do i feel like i


---------12:45----------
can breathe right so


---------12:47----------
it's uh it's it's been a journey like


---------12:49----------
growing up especially here especially


---------12:51----------
with how


---------12:52----------
um you know that environment was post 9


---------12:55----------
11 right


---------12:56----------
wow yeah and and so


---------13:00----------
let me just think for a second so do you


---------13:03----------
have siblings you mind if i ask


---------13:05----------
i have uh one brother yeah okay older


---------13:07----------
younger


---------13:08----------
younger five years younger than me and


---------13:10----------
and did you get a sense of


---------13:12----------
so so you're you're like a full-time


---------13:14----------
youtuber now right


---------13:17----------
uh it's a hobby sort of but okay yeah


---------13:21----------
yeah hobbyist at this point so when you


---------13:23----------
say so when you say you work from eight


---------13:25----------
to three thirty can you help me


---------13:26----------
understand what


---------13:27----------
what you consider work so eight to three


---------13:30----------
thirty


---------13:31----------
is when i start up my actual work


---------13:33----------
computer because i have two separate


---------13:35----------
computers right like a work computer and


---------13:36----------
then like a gaming computer right i keep


---------13:38----------
it completely separate because


---------13:40----------
when i have games installed on my work


---------13:42----------
computer it


---------13:43----------
you know mine goes somewhere else i'll


---------13:45----------
play this match in there so i started my


---------13:46----------
work computer uh


---------13:48----------
when it comes to my actual you know job


---------13:50----------
i work as you know i work investing and


---------13:52----------
you know at this point right like stock


---------13:53----------
market stuff so


---------13:55----------
i got to wake up i got to wake up early


---------13:56----------
i got to like screen stuff and i got to


---------13:58----------
like screen stocks and i got to like


---------13:59----------
look at investments so i'll buy and sell


---------14:01----------
early in the morning


---------14:02----------
and i'm usually done by like noon


---------14:05----------
if i'm you know oh so i missed that so


---------14:07----------
you're like a day trader


---------14:10----------
yeah i used to be but now it's just you


---------14:11----------
know at this point that that was what i


---------14:13----------
used to do for a while and now things


---------14:15----------
have become more


---------14:16----------
relaxed so it's just buying and selling


---------14:18----------
and that's pretty much what it is for me


---------14:20----------
so buying large commodities and putting


---------14:22----------
them on the market selling and things of


---------14:24----------
that nature


---------14:25----------
and so what did you think you were going


---------14:28----------
to do in high school


---------14:30----------
oh man i had no prospects coming out of


---------14:33----------
high school i was so


---------14:34----------
in the middle of work and studying that


---------14:37----------
around the time of 11th grade


---------14:39----------
because in high school they tell you is


---------14:41----------
your 11th grade results and your 12th


---------14:42----------
grade results is what matters to go to


---------14:44----------
college


---------14:45----------
i was so busy at the time that i was


---------14:47----------
like man what did i want to do


---------14:49----------
um if i had any goal in my life


---------14:52----------
uh it was to be a lawyer because that's


---------14:55----------
i would consider that have been my dream


---------14:57----------
job for the longest time is to work in


---------14:58----------
law


---------14:59----------
but uh this is a point where money going


---------15:01----------
into law school is probably one of the


---------15:03----------
after medical school it might be the


---------15:05----------
second most expensive form of schooling


---------15:07----------
maybe


---------15:08----------
toe to toe so that wasn't a reality for


---------15:10----------
me at the time


---------15:11----------
after high school it was just i actually


---------15:14----------
applied to the army but


---------15:15----------
you know that didn't go anywhere


---------15:17----------
eventually i just worked


---------15:19----------
i went to university for computer


---------15:20----------
sciences and that's it


---------15:22----------
and and so you said you were working in


---------15:24----------
high school what kind of work did you do


---------15:25----------
in high school


---------15:27----------
uh just computer work early and that's


---------15:30----------
what i was doing you know your basic


---------15:31----------
like part-time work nothing you know


---------15:33----------
substantial i was also a student at the


---------15:34----------
time and


---------15:36----------
in fact a lot of my work really ended up


---------15:38----------
being just like basic community


---------15:40----------
service work just to rack on the hours


---------15:42----------
because in canada you have to do your


---------15:43----------
minimal amount of community service to


---------15:45----------
graduate like 40 hours


---------15:46----------
but 40 hours is like the minimum you


---------15:49----------
need like


---------15:50----------
way over 40 if you want to get into a


---------15:51----------
good university or at least even have an


---------15:53----------
attempt


---------15:54----------
so i was always working for free either


---------15:56----------
that making some part-time cash on the


---------15:58----------
side


---------15:59----------
um and that's pretty much or you know


---------16:01----------
getting my


---------16:02----------
studies done some night schooling


---------16:04----------
because we had to get more credits than


---------16:05----------
i had because i moved around a lot


---------16:07----------
during high school


---------16:08----------
in america and canada so when you move


---------16:11----------
around during high school


---------16:12----------
your credits don't carry over sometimes


---------16:16----------
so i had to take some extra classes to


---------16:17----------
even be able to graduate and get into


---------16:19----------
university so it was a hectic period


---------16:21----------
hectic four years of my life


---------16:23----------
that you know that doesn't sound very


---------16:25----------
fun


---------16:27----------
it is absolutely the most unfun thing


---------16:30----------
and


---------16:30----------
you know what makes it even more unfun


---------16:32----------
is when you're not good at a lot of your


---------16:33----------
subjects like i was never good at


---------16:34----------
english


---------16:35----------
i didn't have a lot of good creative


---------16:37----------
classes i was in the only class that i


---------16:39----------
was really


---------16:39----------
really good at was math that's about it


---------16:42----------
that's my background right like math is


---------16:44----------
one of those things where it's like okay


---------16:45----------
you give me a formula i'll be able to


---------16:46----------
you know


---------16:47----------
extrapolate based on that but uh i i


---------16:50----------
literally could not do


---------16:52----------
i i was just i wasn't really feeling all


---------16:54----------
the other subjects i was good at it like


---------16:56----------
i could get good grades but


---------16:58----------
you're not feeling it right like i don't


---------16:59----------
want to go to this english class like


---------17:01----------
sure i'll


---------17:02----------
get your 90 and i'll call it a day but


---------17:03----------
it's not fun for me it's not engaging me


---------17:06----------
uh the only class that i actually even


---------17:08----------
ever enjoyed


---------17:09----------
asides from math which i'm saying


---------17:11----------
enjoyed because


---------17:12----------
i i like numbers you know to an extent


---------17:16----------
was a video production class it was sort


---------17:18----------
of like you know one of those electives


---------17:20----------
you would have


---------17:20----------
you would just pick in so i was like i


---------17:23----------
get to edit videos on final cut pro it


---------17:24----------
sounds like you worked really hard in


---------17:26----------
high school


---------17:28----------
talking about taking night classes doing


---------17:30----------
community service


---------17:31----------
like side jobs on the side like mm-hmm


---------17:36----------
yeah no it's it's blurred i'll i'll help


---------17:39----------
you understand


---------17:40----------
yeah i mean can you help me understand


---------17:42----------
like what was in your mind


---------17:44----------
like if you're a sophomore in high


---------17:46----------
school


---------17:48----------
like my mind was to in my head i had


---------17:51----------
this long-term goal of keeping my grade


---------17:53----------
point average


---------17:54----------
above a certain point right that's my


---------17:56----------
long-term goal


---------17:57----------
um in sophomore year super important


---------17:59----------
because in my head


---------18:01----------
i always think like this right like when


---------18:03----------
they told me that 11th grade and 12th


---------18:05----------
grade was the important grades where


---------18:06----------
they would calculate them like there's


---------18:07----------
no way you're ever going to be


---------18:08----------
successful in those grades if you don't


---------18:10----------
start that success from the 9th grade or


---------18:12----------
the 10th grade era right like if you're


---------18:14----------
just slacking off for the first two


---------18:15----------
years


---------18:16----------
that mentality rolls in to those last


---------18:19----------
two years so i was always


---------18:20----------
working hard and maintaining my gpas


---------18:22----------
having my prerequisites all of that


---------18:24----------
stuff even when we were moving around


---------18:25----------
right i was calculating okay i just lost


---------18:27----------
these many credits


---------18:28----------
i gotta have this much to graduate i was


---------18:30----------
there was a point man for like


---------18:32----------
11th grade i was just focused on can i


---------18:34----------
graduate normally do i have to like


---------18:36----------
victory lap based on how much i moved


---------18:38----------
around


---------18:38----------
you know that's that's what was running


---------18:40----------
in my head so


---------18:42----------
um and i remember like moving around my


---------18:44----------
dad who


---------18:45----------
is in the medical field he moves around


---------18:47----------
a lot because of it uh i never


---------18:49----------
ever told him that yeah this is really


---------18:51----------
piling on to me dad because i didn't


---------18:52----------
want to like you know be a burden on it


---------18:54----------
i don't want to tell him to


---------18:54----------
know screw your job over because i'm


---------18:57----------
telling you so i just kind of rolled


---------18:58----------
with it i


---------18:59----------
dealt with the punches because i'm


---------19:00----------
telling you high school felt like i was


---------19:02----------
in the longest boxing match of my life


---------19:04----------
and there was no breaks right like it


---------19:05----------
was just that's punch


---------19:07----------
punch it was punch punch punch dude even


---------19:10----------
summer breaks we had those two month


---------19:11----------
breaks and for a lot of students for a


---------19:13----------
lot of guys it's like two months off


---------19:15----------
i hold on i'm just getting a little two


---------19:17----------
months off


---------19:18----------
i it feels like forever for me two


---------19:20----------
months off felt like a weekend now you


---------19:22----------
know


---------19:22----------
it's just like all right school's ended


---------19:24----------
okay i got some homework i got to focus


---------19:25----------
on what's happening


---------19:26----------
going into this next grade i got to make


---------19:28----------
sure that you know i have i even had


---------19:30----------
like a money


---------19:31----------
you know like goal too because i was


---------19:32----------
like i got to save enough cash


---------19:34----------
in order to even think of going to


---------19:36----------
college or university right so


---------19:38----------
wow yeah like i would say


---------19:41----------
growing up for me happened uh forcibly


---------19:44----------
you know


---------19:45----------
a lot of people get to enjoy their life


---------19:47----------
like you know their younger age they get


---------19:48----------
to make their mistakes


---------19:50----------
i was on like a tight rope with no


---------19:52----------
safety net


---------19:53----------
imagine having the imagine having the


---------19:56----------
like the the skinniest thread going


---------19:58----------
across the niagara falls


---------19:59----------
and you have to cross the entire thing


---------20:01----------
and there's no safety net


---------20:02----------
so that's what my life kind of felt like


---------20:05----------
felt like for a while


---------20:06----------
when did you realize how old were you


---------20:08----------
when you realized that you have no


---------20:09----------
safety net


---------20:11----------
uh probably


---------20:17----------
first year of college i would say when i


---------20:20----------
when i got into college right because


---------20:21----------
when i i thought when i got into


---------20:23----------
university for a while and i dropped out


---------20:24----------
like a semester in because i was like


---------20:26----------
okay no no i'm not doing


---------20:27----------
because university of toronto like the


---------20:29----------
first semester that you went in you paid


---------20:30----------
this


---------20:31----------
crazy amount and uh


---------20:34----------
at this point i started you know getting


---------20:36----------
more work on the side i started building


---------20:38----------
up a career so i was like wait a minute


---------20:39----------
do i choose to go through this


---------20:40----------
university path which will work for me


---------20:42----------
or to go on the career path that's when


---------20:44----------
i realized like okay i'm on that tight


---------20:46----------
rope you know like i'm on


---------20:47----------
i've got no safety in it like i'm after


---------20:49----------
high school high school was that era


---------20:50----------
where i could make my mistakes right


---------20:52----------
now i'm in college now i'm in the


---------20:54----------
professional field you know now i'm like


---------20:56----------
on my own i have to make money to pay my


---------20:58----------
mortgages or


---------20:59----------
rent at the time and that's when i


---------21:01----------
realized okay now i can't make a single


---------21:03----------
mistake


---------21:04----------
now i'm stuck in now whatever i choose


---------21:07----------
to go


---------21:07----------
whatever choice i make now will affect


---------21:09----------
my weeks going on forward that's where


---------21:10----------
my mind was


---------21:11----------
you know first year of college i find


---------21:14----------
that a little bit hard to believe


---------21:15----------
um because i i know it sounds kind of a


---------21:17----------
weird thing to say but like


---------21:18----------
it sounds to me like you you were sort


---------21:21----------
of really think


---------21:22----------
i mean maybe you had a safety net of


---------21:24----------
sorts but it sounds to me like even when


---------21:26----------
you were a freshman or sophomore in high


---------21:27----------
school you were like


---------21:29----------
i gotta start now like you know it's i


---------21:31----------
almost hear that mentality there


---------21:33----------
like even earlier than college where


---------21:36----------
like if you screw up


---------21:37----------
in 10th grade there's no way you can do


---------21:40----------
what you need to in 11th grade or 12th


---------21:42----------
grade


---------21:42----------
no i i'll say that i had the mentality


---------21:44----------
in high school like that then


---------21:46----------
because like i told you earlier i was


---------21:47----------
like okay i got to make sure my grades


---------21:49----------
are good yeah


---------21:50----------
to get accepted into college but when i


---------21:52----------
got into college right you think like


---------21:54----------
for a second that you can breathe for a


---------21:55----------
bit now that you're in college you know


---------21:57----------
you've gotten into


---------21:58----------
the university you've wanted to you're


---------21:59----------
into the program and it's still hard


---------22:01----------
right like it you know it's


---------22:02----------
it's not high school you know advanced


---------22:05----------
anymore it's still


---------22:06----------
it's it's you're professional at that


---------22:07----------
point and i think the reality of


---------22:09----------
when i turned 18 and i became a full


---------22:11----------
adult and you know i didn't have my


---------22:13----------
parents to depend on anymore


---------22:15----------
i had like it felt like every choice


---------22:17----------
decision that i was making was


---------22:18----------
completely on me and like


---------22:22----------
college that you know 18 to like 25 was


---------22:24----------
that moment where like every


---------22:26----------
decision i make will affect how my life


---------22:27----------
is forward i feel like that's


---------22:30----------
that's where i realized like okay you


---------22:32----------
know call high school


---------22:33----------
maybe i could have made a mess up or two


---------22:35----------
right maybe


---------22:36----------
you know but not not in my college or


---------22:40----------
professional


---------22:40----------
life you sound very um


---------22:43----------
you know like the future was sort of


---------22:45----------
like bearing down on you like every


---------22:46----------
single day like that's


---------22:48----------
sort of what i'm feeling it's like


---------22:49----------
there's sort of this i still feel like


---------22:51----------
that man i mean


---------22:52----------
even though like i'm 27 now and i think


---------22:54----------
i've got my life together


---------22:56----------
i still think about what life is going


---------22:59----------
to be like at 40 for me right


---------23:01----------
and yeah it's interesting because my dad


---------23:03----------
one day sat me down


---------23:04----------
you know just before the pandemic he's


---------23:06----------
like because i told him this exact same


---------23:07----------
conversation that we're having right now


---------23:09----------
it's


---------23:09----------
deja vu for me i told him about like i


---------23:12----------
got a prep for my life at 40 and my dad


---------23:14----------
one time he told me he's like do you


---------23:15----------
even know if you're going to be alive at


---------23:16----------
40. like my dad had this conversation it


---------23:18----------
was a weird conversation


---------23:19----------
like dad why would you think that right


---------23:20----------
like and the dad's like no it's a legit


---------23:22----------
question like are you gonna be


---------23:23----------
you know alive at 40. like how do you


---------23:26----------
know that


---------23:27----------
how do you know why are you choosing to


---------23:28----------
like live for life and


---------23:31----------
why are you prepping for 40 when you're


---------23:32----------
not even living now


---------23:35----------
and even though we had that conversation


---------23:36----------
it's hard to ever get out of that


---------23:38----------
mindset you know like it's there's never


---------23:39----------
a night


---------23:40----------
i have where i go to bed and i don't


---------23:42----------
think


---------23:44----------
tomorrow you know the responsibilities


---------23:46----------
that i have right like


---------23:47----------
you know all of that just sort of


---------23:50----------
compiles on you


---------23:52----------
i would absolutely love to have like a


---------23:54----------
mental guide map i feel like


---------23:56----------
this is this is actually a really great


---------23:58----------
question for me i


---------23:59----------
i look at life in the numbers and like


---------24:02----------
what's there you know like


---------24:04----------
good example right like when i look at


---------24:06----------
things tomorrow right i'm like this is


---------24:07----------
how much i need to pay for my bill


---------24:09----------
tomorrow my mortgage you know every


---------24:10----------
payment for the next six seven months


---------24:12----------
right i look at it from a numbers


---------24:13----------
perspective right like this is what i


---------24:14----------
need


---------24:15----------
but i never look at myself right i never


---------24:16----------
realized what do i need to make sure


---------24:18----------
mentally


---------24:19----------
is what i'm prepared for for the next


---------24:20----------
day right like


---------24:22----------
what how do i make sure that i'm


---------24:24----------
mentally like sane six months from now


---------24:26----------
right how do i make sure that i don't


---------24:28----------
overwork myself to like you know literal


---------24:30----------
insanity so yeah i would actually like


---------24:32----------
the help there is there a problem


---------24:34----------
yes there's a big problem that's because


---------24:37----------
your goal


---------24:37----------
is actually reinforcing the problem


---------24:41----------
so it's subtle but you're like


---------24:44----------
you know so like instead of thinking


---------24:46----------
about dollars like you've said oh


---------24:48----------
muda has like a bank account and he has


---------24:51----------
like


---------24:52----------
a mental bank account and what i'm doing


---------24:55----------
right now is i'm withdrawing money from


---------24:57----------
my mental bank account to make sure my


---------24:59----------
physical bank account is good


---------25:01----------
how do i ensure that my mental bank


---------25:04----------
account


---------25:04----------
is nice and full you see what i'm saying


---------25:08----------
but it's still that that mentality of


---------25:10----------
like how do i make sure that tomorrow is


---------25:12----------
gonna be okay


---------25:15----------
yeah and and we could talk about


---------25:17----------
isolation in the pandemic if you want to


---------25:19----------
i i you know this is it's


---------25:21----------
it's really your i feel like it's more i


---------25:23----------
feel like it's more interesting to hit


---------25:25----------
the root of my actual mental problem


---------25:26----------
here


---------25:27----------
yeah if you're gay this is yeah this is


---------25:29----------
way beyond isolation this is like my


---------25:31----------
entire life


---------25:32----------
yep and that's what we're here so let's


---------25:34----------
you okay diving in a little bit


---------25:36----------
yeah i'm okay diving in okay if i if you


---------25:40----------
ask you a question that makes you


---------25:43----------
i'll let you know if i want to answer


---------25:45----------
yeah yeah


---------25:46----------
right okay um i was about to say it


---------25:49----------
makes you uncomfortable but


---------25:50----------
i think it's okay for me to ask you


---------25:51----------
questions that make you uncomfortable


---------25:53----------
and you got to let me know if i step too


---------25:54----------
far


---------25:55----------
okay okay so i'm i'm going to start with


---------25:58----------
so


---------25:59----------
tell me what it's like to live one day


---------26:00----------
in your head


---------26:03----------
if i was an observer in your head what


---------26:06----------
would what would i witness


---------26:10----------
well you'd witness me waking up


---------26:13----------
and immediately checking all my emails


---------26:17----------
work things for what we have to do today


---------26:19----------
for the next week throughout the week


---------26:21----------
you know doing all of that busy work in


---------26:22----------
your head making all your calls making


---------26:25----------
all you know


---------26:26----------
you know your day-to-day communication


---------26:28----------
and then uh living


---------26:29----------
basically i would say hour by hour as to


---------26:32----------
handling in and making sure all of your


---------26:33----------
work responsibilities are met day-to-day


---------26:36----------
i would say that if you were an observer


---------26:37----------
looking in you'd probably notice that


---------26:39----------
for an hour in the morning


---------26:40----------
i get to breathe a little bit and then


---------26:42----------
for the rest of the day it's like


---------26:43----------
autopilot


---------26:43----------
you know like work i'm doing this and


---------26:46----------
then towards the end of the day like you


---------26:47----------
know


---------26:48----------
4 4 35 is when you get to see me again


---------26:50----------
right like i've entered my body


---------26:52----------
seeing me be myself and what what is


---------26:55----------
what is it like when you enter your body


---------26:57----------
again


---------26:59----------
it's uh


---------27:04----------
i guess it's like a feeling of just i


---------27:07----------
guess uh


---------27:08----------
well for one you know you you get to


---------27:10----------
breathe again you know you get to be


---------27:11----------
yourself you get to focus on what your


---------27:13----------
hobbies are you get to focus on what you


---------27:14----------
want to do for the rest of the day right


---------27:15----------
now you finally gotten your body back


---------27:18----------
so for me it's like hey do i go out for


---------27:19----------
a walk or do i go home and i sit and


---------27:22----------
program something that i'm into because


---------27:23----------
one of the things that i love to do


---------27:24----------
after work is i love to you know sit


---------27:26----------
around and program and tinker with you


---------27:27----------
know a couple computers that i have


---------27:28----------
sitting around over here so for me


---------27:30----------
the rest of the day is just basically


---------27:32----------
what i love you know like


---------27:34----------
what i actually want to do not what i


---------27:36----------
have to do to to survive


---------27:37----------
day by day right so for me that's what


---------27:40----------
it comes down to and then


---------27:42----------
that's pretty much what it is regardless


---------27:44----------
of what my channel name is some ordinary


---------27:46----------
gamers i do


---------27:47----------
i don't do a whole lot of gaming


---------27:49----------
throughout the week unfortunately


---------27:50----------
because of responsibilities anymore


---------27:52----------
but uh you know that's the day of my


---------27:55----------
life an observer if you will


---------27:57----------
um i'm doing something every hour


---------27:59----------
there's never a point where i sit down


---------28:00----------
and i


---------28:01----------
i really breathe you know like i have


---------28:03----------
like my moments but i'm always


---------28:05----------
what happens when you sit down and try


---------28:07----------
to breathe


---------28:09----------
i honestly can't like everyone gives me


---------28:12----------
advices on meditation uh you know like


---------28:14----------
breathe for like 15 minutes


---------28:16----------
you know do something and i keep doing


---------28:17----------
it but like there's this feeling of


---------28:19----------
anxiety


---------28:20----------
i would say like there's this feeling


---------28:22----------
that a physical feeling it's almost like


---------28:23----------
you know when your


---------28:24----------
throat is raspy


---------28:27----------
you know what i mean like it almost


---------28:29----------
feels like it's just you're throwing


---------28:30----------
lava down your throat like it's just


---------28:32----------
it's


---------28:33----------
you just don't feel good it's kind of


---------28:34----------
like a panic attack if you will because


---------28:36----------
i feel like i have to be doing something


---------28:39----------
it could be anything it could be


---------28:40----------
something it could literally be me like


---------28:42----------
you know spinning something in my hand


---------28:44----------
right like a fidget spinner whatever


---------28:46----------
anything but i i don't know if i can sit


---------28:48----------
down in a chair


---------28:50----------
and just close my eyes and breathe


---------28:53----------
non-stop for 15 minutes because in my


---------28:54----------
head i'm always like wow you could have


---------28:55----------
done something productive you could have


---------28:57----------
done something


---------28:58----------
you've just sat down and literally did


---------29:00----------
nothing you know you just sat down in


---------29:01----------
your own head


---------29:02----------
my brain doesn't allow me to sort of


---------29:04----------
think for a little bit to


---------29:05----------
to be in my head you know because my


---------29:07----------
head there's another voice that tells me


---------29:09----------
you gotta do this you gotta do that you


---------29:11----------
got to make sure this is done


---------29:12----------
you're wasting your time you know you


---------29:14----------
have this responsibility for tomorrow


---------29:15----------
you got to make sure that it's set


---------29:17----------
like i had i had a video project that i


---------29:19----------
had to get done


---------29:20----------
on friday one time this was a month ago


---------29:22----------
i uh i do a big video project on my


---------29:24----------
channel every month


---------29:26----------
so i divide up the whole thing you know


---------29:27----------
like i'll do an hour of it


---------29:29----------
one day and then i'll do an hour of it


---------29:30----------
the other day so i've already divided it


---------29:32----------
you know but even though that i've


---------29:35----------
allocated one hour of my day to this


---------29:36----------
project


---------29:37----------
when i sit down to breathe i'm like you


---------29:40----------
could have applied this half an hour to


---------29:42----------
this project and sort of gotten it done


---------29:43----------
faster you could have made the project


---------29:45----------
better


---------29:45----------
so when i'm uploading this video in my


---------29:47----------
head i'm like wow it could be way better


---------29:49----------
than what i did


---------29:49----------
i wasted you know free time it'll always


---------29:52----------
constantly run through your head like


---------29:54----------
there's never a there's never a point


---------29:55----------
where your brain will allow you to stop


---------29:57----------
and


---------29:57----------
think and be yourself it's always you


---------30:00----------
can do something you can be doing


---------30:01----------
something


---------30:02----------
you're not doing anything so i wouldn't


---------30:05----------
say worthless feeling but you know


---------30:08----------
it's it's not healthy at the same time i


---------30:09----------
don't know how to exactly describe that


---------30:11----------
i don't know the term if it exists but


---------30:13----------
how does it feel to share that


---------30:16----------
ah it doesn't yeah it feels


---------30:19----------
weird like i keep a lot of this in my


---------30:21----------
head man yeah


---------30:23----------
i never have the i don't think i have


---------30:24----------
the courage to ever describe this


---------30:27----------
to people you know like if you were to


---------30:30----------
sit across from me and you asked me hey


---------30:31----------
are you okay


---------30:32----------
i would most likely give you a lie like


---------30:35----------
i would lie to your face and be like i'm


---------30:36----------
totally


---------30:37----------
you know like i don't think i have the


---------30:40----------
why does it require courage to i just


---------30:44----------
feel like i'm


---------30:44----------
opening myself i feel like i'm coming


---------30:46----------
across as weak when i tell you like


---------30:49----------
i you know i'm calling myself this


---------30:51----------
worthless individual in my head i don't


---------30:53----------
want to like reiterate that same thing


---------30:54----------
to you i'll tell you that i'm doing fine


---------30:57----------
like even when it came to my parents


---------30:58----------
right it's like are you okay like are


---------30:59----------
you doing so i would always tell them


---------31:00----------
yeah


---------31:01----------
i'm absolutely wonder like even even


---------31:03----------
when we were moving around and i could


---------31:04----------
my dad like hey moving around in high


---------31:06----------
school would have been pretty bad like


---------31:07----------
it would have added stress i'm like no


---------31:08----------
dad it's 100 great i'll make it work


---------31:10----------
absolutely so you know this is one lie


---------31:13----------
you keep telling yourself and you try to


---------31:14----------
lie enough about that that you end up


---------31:16----------
believing


---------31:16----------
yourself i guess i feel weak in my head


---------31:19----------
like


---------31:20----------
i can't i don't have the i don't have


---------31:22----------
the courage to tell somebody that i feel


---------31:24----------
weak in my


---------31:26----------
i've always felt that those feelings


---------31:29----------
are a lot easier to deal with if you can


---------31:31----------
bottle it up


---------31:32----------
and punch through the day you know what


---------31:34----------
i mean the boxing match that never ends


---------31:38----------
the boxing match that'll never end


---------31:42----------
like some days it feels like it feels


---------31:44----------
like i i guess


---------31:45----------
it just it's like it's like somebody's


---------31:49----------
shooting me you know what i mean


---------31:50----------
it's like it's like it's like it's like


---------31:52----------
i'm getting shot every day right like


---------31:54----------
it's like that feeling right like that


---------31:55----------
punch to your stomach you know what i


---------31:57----------
mean and it's like


---------31:59----------
you can tell somebody that it hurts you


---------32:01----------
can tell somebody that it you know


---------32:03----------
you know you can lean on somebody or you


---------32:05----------
can just sort of


---------32:06----------
deal with the fact that it happened to


---------32:07----------
you and move on you know if that makes


---------32:09----------
any sense right like


---------32:10----------
you know you've you've already had the


---------32:13----------
impact


---------32:14----------
so are you gonna are you gonna waste


---------32:15----------
time sticking with it are you gonna


---------32:17----------
waste time


---------32:18----------
thinking to yourself what you could have


---------32:19----------
changed or will you just proceed to go


---------32:21----------
on or will you fight on ahead right


---------32:23----------
yeah persevere yeah perseverance exactly


---------32:27----------
you know


---------32:28----------
the strong survive type mentality that


---------32:30----------
like


---------32:31----------
there's no time for a break your brain


---------32:34----------
won't let you sit quietly for 15 minutes


---------32:37----------
absolutely not because you have to


---------32:38----------
persevere


---------32:41----------
and if you don't then your brain will


---------32:42----------
tell you you're wasting time


---------32:47----------
do you feel me sharing this right now


---------32:50----------
yeah actually


---------32:51----------
to be honest with you i feel uh yeah i


---------32:55----------
feel i


---------32:56----------
i i got i gotta i gotta i gotta


---------32:59----------
i have spent my entire life bottling


---------33:02----------
things up you know like if anything is


---------33:04----------
genuinely hurting me mentally


---------33:09----------
i felt that it's easier if i can just


---------33:10----------
bottle it up and push on but i've got


---------33:12----------
you know younger siblings i've got


---------33:14----------
parents you know like


---------33:15----------
the older they get the more i gotta take


---------33:17----------
care of them so it's like i gotta be in


---------33:18----------
that mentality


---------33:20----------
in some ways i gotta get used to be the


---------33:22----------
stone if you will right like this


---------33:24----------
tanooki suit from


---------33:25----------
mario which is like just perfectly still


---------33:27----------
like it just nothing can affect it


---------33:29----------
yeah i know the thing about the tanooki


---------33:31----------
suit is that you can't move anywhere


---------33:34----------
stay stuck


---------33:38----------
i mean i know listen in my head i know


---------33:40----------
at one point like for a long time


---------33:42----------
that if i keep doing it will be the


---------33:44----------
death of me like physically


---------33:46----------
if i if i choose to keep doing this


---------33:49----------
concept of


---------33:52----------
if i choose if i choose to keep bottling


---------33:54----------
myself up


---------33:55----------
i am eventually killing myself by doing


---------33:58----------
you know because there's no way that


---------33:59----------
i i feel like mentally i'll be able to


---------34:01----------
keep doing it for 10 more years like if


---------34:03----------
i'm 35 36 still bottling and things


---------34:06----------
that's going to be where my brain stops


---------34:09----------
working and


---------34:10----------
you know i'm just either i become such


---------34:12----------
an emotionless person either i do with


---------34:14----------
it that i lose who i am


---------34:16----------
or you know gets worse it's


---------34:19----------
unsustainable it's just not possible


---------34:20----------
it's not something healthy but i don't


---------34:22----------
know the way out i don't know how to


---------34:23----------
escape it


---------34:25----------
what scares me the most is i won't ever


---------34:27----------
figure out how to escape it


---------34:30----------
what's your understanding of


---------34:34----------
what's my understanding of okay i think


---------34:36----------
for a second muda


---------34:38----------
yeah yeah no absolutely go ahead take


---------34:39----------
your time


---------34:53----------
i don't want to feel like i'm one of


---------34:54----------
your you know hard cases or something


---------34:56----------
like


---------34:57----------
yeah so sorry i i i i get the sense


---------35:00----------
you're very anxiously looking at my face


---------35:02----------
and trying to interpret


---------35:04----------
how i'm sitting with what you're sharing


---------35:05----------
so let me just start talking because


---------35:07----------
i've


---------35:07----------
i'm afraid that if i sit silently for a


---------35:10----------
minute your mind is gonna


---------35:12----------
like create all kinds of negative


---------35:13----------
thoughts does that make sense yeah yeah


---------35:15----------
it already is beginning so what is it


---------35:17----------
share with me what your mind is


---------35:19----------
telling you right now well in your head


---------35:22----------
when you look around it's like when you


---------35:24----------
have when your eyes open up a little bit


---------35:25----------
and you're you know it's like earlier


---------35:27----------
you're like the [ __ ] right like you were


---------35:28----------
just like what's going on with


---------35:30----------
i was like man in my head for a second


---------35:32----------
i'm like i guess i'm i guess i'm too far


---------35:34----------
gone i guess i'm just one of those


---------35:35----------
people that he's like


---------35:37----------
i thought this guy was you know i


---------35:39----------
thought i thought i thought you know i


---------35:40----------
could do some work with this guy and i


---------35:42----------
was just


---------35:44----------
oh he's gone i uh uh i'm i'm very


---------35:47----------
confident that we can do work i can


---------35:49----------
i can feel very good about helping you


---------35:51----------
with this


---------35:52----------
um so so but and and i i think it's


---------35:56----------
tricky because no matter what i say even


---------35:58----------
if i


---------35:58----------
if i say something like that i would


---------35:59----------
imagine that instead of being reassured


---------36:02----------
you would actually feel like


---------36:03----------
maybe a little bit ashamed if i say


---------36:05----------
something like that


---------36:07----------
do you detect it actually actually you


---------36:09----------
hit it right on the money there


---------36:11----------
right now yeah


---------36:14----------
now now what what is it tell me when i


---------36:17----------
say


---------36:17----------
no no don't worry i can absolutely help


---------36:19----------
you with this and then what do you feel


---------36:22----------
i don't know i just i guess i feel like


---------36:23----------
the the positivity like sort of the


---------36:25----------
laugh for a second that you had


---------36:28----------
it almost i would feel like it's kind of


---------36:29----------
like a pitying in a way you know what i


---------36:31----------
mean like i don't know we can we can


---------36:32----------
deal with it


---------36:33----------
it's just it's it's hard for my brain to


---------36:38----------
believe it


---------36:38----------
you know it's hard for my brain to


---------36:39----------
believe it after so long what does it


---------36:41----------
believe


---------36:42----------
what is it my brain believes it's my


---------36:44----------
brain honestly believes


---------36:46----------
so it's my brain just telling me that


---------36:48----------
it's all like just bs and you can't just


---------36:50----------
do it you know


---------36:52----------
yeah my my brain is working against it


---------36:54----------
it's very difficult to explain how it's


---------36:56----------
working against it but it's it's it's


---------36:57----------
treating this whole scenario like


---------36:59----------
like it's it's all a joke and maybe like


---------37:02----------
someone's pitying you for what you're in


---------37:03----------
right now


---------37:05----------
um but i mean i i'm trying like in my


---------37:08----------
head i'm trying to convince myself yeah


---------37:10----------
okay


---------37:10----------
you know this is help right i don't want


---------37:12----------
it to be pity


---------37:13----------
no yeah we're good we're gonna help you


---------37:15----------
out so we're gonna calm your brain down


---------37:16----------
you ready


---------37:18----------
okay yeah so it's it's better to be dead


---------37:21----------
than weak


---------37:24----------
right that's true yeah you know you


---------37:27----------
don't like


---------37:28----------
like it's fine to suffer but like you


---------37:30----------
don't actually like need someone's help


---------37:32----------
you don't need your pity you can punch


---------37:34----------
through


---------37:36----------
you know and if like if the cost is your


---------37:39----------
mental health if the cost is a heart


---------37:40----------
attack


---------37:41----------
that's a price we're willing to pay


---------37:44----------
it's all good like we can handle that


---------37:46----------
we've survived this [ __ ] no mess


---------37:47----------
you know how messed up it is that i


---------37:49----------
believe that 100 that is like


---------37:51----------
that is a mantra i could live by like


---------37:53----------
it's better to be dead than it is weak


---------37:55----------
that's that's you've literally hit my


---------37:57----------
life [ __ ] like you


---------37:59----------
you like you know like you walk into an


---------38:01----------
office and they have like their company


---------38:03----------
slogan


---------38:03----------
you've exactly like wrote the company


---------38:05----------
slogan out there it's better to be dead


---------38:07----------
than it is


---------38:08----------
yeah when you say you could live your


---------38:10----------
life by it bro you have been living your


---------38:12----------
life


---------38:13----------
yeah you're right i haven't looked any


---------38:15----------
other way hypothetical my dude


---------38:18----------
yeah no no it's not


---------38:21----------
yeah exactly i'm making it sound like i


---------38:23----------
could be in the situation no i


---------38:25----------
am in the situation i am living in that


---------38:27----------
i built the entire house myself


---------38:29----------
yeah absolutely yeah right absolutely i


---------38:31----------
mean it's like you know that's your


---------38:33----------
company slogan this is the house that


---------38:34----------
you've built


---------38:36----------
right that's the bet i made you know i


---------38:38----------
better lay in it i guess


---------38:39----------
absolutely right it's it's my i chose


---------38:42----------
this


---------38:43----------
yeah right i have no one to blame i


---------38:45----------
don't need anyone's help no one needs to


---------38:47----------
pity me like


---------38:48----------
i did this yeah no 100


---------38:51----------
i i mean like i think of life as like in


---------38:53----------
a way i know that i said isolation i i


---------38:56----------
i said it earlier that i'm a very like


---------38:57----------
reserved like i'll


---------38:59----------
engage with everyone around me but in a


---------39:00----------
lot of ways and


---------39:03----------
if if i guess i feel i guess i feel like


---------39:07----------
in my head like the only life i've ever


---------39:08----------
known is being


---------39:09----------
alone on an island or sort of by


---------39:11----------
yourself trudging through every aspect


---------39:13----------
of your life yourself because it's like


---------39:15----------
for me i don't think i can rely on


---------39:17----------
anyone professionally i always put it on


---------39:19----------
to myself and that's


---------39:20----------
how i've succeeded in my life and that's


---------39:22----------
how i'll continue to succeed i think


---------39:23----------
it's very hard for me to include any


---------39:26----------
full partner you know what i mean like


---------39:28----------
uh


---------39:30----------
honestly i i feel like a lot of my


---------39:31----------
relationships in life have failed right


---------39:33----------
like


---------39:33----------
well you know romantic relationships


---------39:35----------
because i choose to


---------39:37----------
it's great for a while but then i just


---------39:39----------
tend to reserve and


---------39:41----------
get back into myself and it's hard for


---------39:42----------
me to end up trusting anyone else and


---------39:43----------
sort of confiding anymore like


---------39:45----------
literally the conversation that we just


---------39:46----------
had now i could never have even if i was


---------39:50----------
we're talking like two years into our


---------39:52----------
relationship if we talk


---------39:53----------
never this this is never going to happen


---------39:56----------
me and you we can never be together


---------39:58----------
i don't know i mean it could have been


---------40:00----------
life is


---------40:01----------
you know what i mean who knows but like


---------40:04----------
that conversation that like level of


---------40:06----------
okay you gave me my company slogan we


---------40:07----------
would never even get like


---------40:09----------
a quarter into that conversation like


---------40:11----------
anything they would like ask me


---------40:13----------
uh you know it's like are you okay my


---------40:15----------
response would be like i'm great


---------40:16----------
you know like yeah perfect absolutely


---------40:18----------
you know how's work


---------40:20----------
even though i could have had the worst


---------40:21----------
day like i could have lost a contract


---------40:23----------
i'm like it's great


---------40:24----------
what would it what would it mean to say


---------40:27----------
things aren't going great


---------40:30----------
what would it mean to say things aren't


---------40:32----------
going great for me is if you could look


---------40:34----------
around me and see the entire burning


---------40:36----------
pile that i'm in you know


---------40:37----------
like if my if my if you walked by my


---------40:40----------
office and it was like yeah foreclosed


---------40:42----------
everything gone company's dead you know


---------40:43----------
they have to dissolve


---------40:44----------
that's what it would take for me to say


---------40:47----------
yeah you know


---------40:48----------
it's not no but so so let's say that


---------40:49----------
that you you just had a bad day


---------40:52----------
what would it mean to you or what would


---------40:54----------
your brain tell you if you tried to


---------40:56----------
share with someone


---------40:58----------
oh my brain would tell me you don't


---------40:59----------
share because like that other person


---------41:01----------
they're probably going to look at you


---------41:02----------
like wow this is the guy that


---------41:04----------
like what an idiot like only an idiot


---------41:06----------
messes up like that right like kind of


---------41:08----------
like if i lost a contract my brain would


---------41:10----------
be like don't tell them that they'll


---------41:11----------
think you're a [ __ ] idiot for telling


---------41:13----------
that they'll think you didn't look you


---------41:14----------
can't even do your job you're like


---------41:16----------
you're like inept doing your job because


---------41:19----------
that's what my brain says like don't


---------41:20----------
bother like even if somebody asks me


---------41:23----------
that like if my parents will do it i'll


---------41:24----------
be like


---------41:26----------
work is going fine don't worry about it


---------41:28----------
even though


---------41:29----------
you know if i have a bad day i have a


---------41:30----------
bad day i can't you know tell anybody


---------41:32----------
anything


---------41:35----------
uh uh muda i'd i'd like a moment to


---------41:37----------
think


---------41:38----------
but i i want us to be a little bit


---------41:40----------
careful about what kind of judgments


---------41:42----------
your mind is telling you


---------41:44----------
yeah okay um


---------41:47----------
i'm just trying to figure out how to


---------41:49----------
help help you through this a little bit


---------41:51----------
and and don't worry you're going to do


---------41:52----------
it all on your own i'm just going to


---------41:54----------
point the way you're going to do all the


---------41:55----------
heavy lifting okay bro


---------41:57----------
all right just can i have a second yeah


---------42:00----------
no absolutely go for it


---------42:03----------
how you holding up by the way i i am


---------42:06----------
i'm actually surprisingly good right now


---------42:10----------
i had a good i had a good day before we


---------42:12----------
came over here like i got all of my work


---------42:14----------
pretty much done out with so


---------42:15----------
everything's great


---------42:17----------
everything is fine quite a bad day it'd


---------42:20----------
be up


---------42:21----------
i had a i had a good day before we


---------42:23----------
started this but but it's


---------42:25----------
no no i have a good day now but like


---------42:26----------
that would have like if


---------42:28----------
i had a terrible if i didn't get my job


---------42:30----------
like if i didn't get my work done before


---------42:32----------
we started i would have been like in a


---------42:33----------
completely off mood


---------42:35----------
so now i'm just like all right so here's


---------42:38----------
here's what we're getting here's my


---------42:39----------
hypothesis okay i'm gonna just lay


---------42:40----------
things out for you because i'm a little


---------42:42----------
bit


---------42:42----------
concerned about i want to try to help


---------42:45----------
you participate in the health healthiest


---------42:47----------
way possible


---------42:48----------
one really healthy way to participate is


---------42:50----------
that i can just predict what your brain


---------42:52----------
is going to tell you and we can kind of


---------42:53----------
like work through that just notice what


---------42:55----------
your brain is doing


---------42:56----------
that's actually that will help you come


---------42:57----------
out of this i know it sounds weird


---------42:59----------
but just noticing these thought patterns


---------43:02----------
will start to give you power over them


---------43:04----------
okay okay but what i'd really like to do


---------43:06----------
is i i think that basically what's going


---------43:08----------
on is that you


---------43:09----------
have like this programming in your head


---------43:13----------
and i think it actually comes from a


---------43:15----------
particular place


---------43:16----------
and as we understand like


---------43:20----------
where that programming comes from is we


---------43:22----------
understand why that voice


---------43:24----------
essentially like started in the first


---------43:27----------
place


---------43:28----------
and further more like what has


---------43:30----------
reinforced


---------43:32----------
the volume of that voice right because i


---------43:36----------
i think


---------43:36----------
at this point if we kind of talk about


---------43:38----------
it like what we see is that


---------43:40----------
it's that voice which has been looking


---------43:42----------
out for you


---------43:44----------
right like does that make sense


---------43:48----------
yeah the the guiding voice in your head


---------43:50----------
that tells you


---------43:51----------
how to succeed day to day yeah yeah


---------43:53----------
right but it's also the voice that kind


---------43:54----------
of like makes you feel like as you say


---------43:56----------
you get shot on a daily basis


---------43:58----------
because you know it's all tangled up


---------44:00----------
right


---------44:01----------
so so what i want you to understand is


---------44:02----------
that like you know our mind


---------44:04----------
does things to adapt to particular


---------44:06----------
situations


---------44:08----------
and then what ends up happening usually


---------44:10----------
later in life


---------44:11----------
is that some of those things can be


---------44:13----------
become maladaptive


---------44:15----------
so you learned how to be like


---------44:16----------
essentially like a one-man show right


---------44:19----------
like


---------44:20----------
you know i i would guess that while your


---------44:22----------
parents probably told you like oh it's


---------44:24----------
good to do


---------44:25----------
in school like they weren't the ones


---------44:27----------
keeping track


---------44:28----------
of like which classes you need to repeat


---------44:31----------
right right like you were doing that for


---------44:34----------
yourself so like


---------44:35----------
like like your ability and so that like


---------44:37----------
that sort of self-reliance was probably


---------44:39----------
like


---------44:40----------
really helpful back then but now as you


---------44:43----------
mentioned i'm glad you brought it up


---------44:44----------
because then you know i don't i don't


---------44:46----------
have to but


---------44:46----------
i i think like when it comes to romantic


---------44:48----------
relationships and stuff it's going to


---------44:50----------
cause problems


---------44:52----------
like because because and so i know it


---------44:54----------
sounds weird but


---------44:55----------
i'd rather be dead than weak i think


---------44:58----------
that's actually not


---------44:59----------
the original slogan that's the rebrand


---------45:02----------
i think actually this problem starts


---------45:05----------
with the phrase


---------45:06----------
making sure and that if you can


---------45:10----------
if you can learn how to like not make


---------45:13----------
sure


---------45:14----------
that dot dot dot then


---------45:17----------
your life will be quite different does


---------45:19----------
that make sense


---------45:20----------
or is that too vague no it makes sense


---------45:23----------
yeah no it's like make sure you don't do


---------45:25----------
this negative thing or else it'll lead


---------45:27----------
into that negative


---------45:28----------
yep so i'd say that the really the


---------45:29----------
controlling thing in your life is like


---------45:31----------
you know and even if you kind of talk


---------45:33----------
about confiding how your day is like


---------45:35----------
what are you really doing when you


---------45:37----------
don't share how you really feel


---------45:40----------
you're making sure right what are you


---------45:43----------
making sure


---------45:44----------
when does that make sense is that like i


---------45:46----------
know it's kind of a weird question


---------45:49----------
i guess i'm making sure that i'm like


---------45:52----------
not exposing myself


---------45:54----------
exactly right so like what are you


---------45:55----------
actually controlling like you're


---------45:57----------
controlling the perception you're making


---------45:59----------
sure


---------46:00----------
that this person does not think about


---------46:02----------
you


---------46:03----------
this way and so what i'm really hearing


---------46:06----------
is that like


---------46:07----------
like you know i could be wrong here okay


---------46:10----------
so this is i'm presenting you with a


---------46:11----------
hypothesis and it's


---------46:13----------
you know you're welcome to push back but


---------46:14----------
like the theme that i'm really hearing


---------46:16----------
is that like


---------46:17----------
you're making sure because it's it's


---------46:19----------
interesting because i'm gonna just start


---------46:20----------
tying stuff together okay


---------46:22----------
could be relevant i mean i don't really


---------46:24----------
know we're like


---------46:25----------
you know we're in alpha testing here


---------46:27----------
okay nowhere near a finished product


---------46:29----------
this idea of like no safety net right


---------46:32----------
and and so like if you think about like


---------46:33----------
you know what is someone who's


---------46:35----------
you did a beautiful job of creating this


---------46:37----------
imagery of like you know a horse hair


---------46:39----------
that is like stretched across for a


---------46:41----------
hundred miles


---------46:43----------
and what is someone who has to cross


---------46:45----------
that tightrope


---------46:46----------
have to do they have to make sure


---------46:48----------
because there's nothing to catch them


---------46:51----------
yeah right and like you know why can't


---------46:53----------
you tell people how you feel because you


---------46:55----------
have to make sure


---------46:56----------
that something when you when you know


---------46:59----------
why do you have to like


---------47:01----------
work you know you wake up every day at 8


---------47:02----------
00 a.m and and and you know you're like


---------47:04----------
oh my work my weekends are my busy days


---------47:06----------
but it sounds like you work seven days a


---------47:08----------
week


---------47:08----------
and then i get a little bit of me time


---------47:10----------
and then even get a bit of me time yeah


---------47:12----------
but even in the me time right your your


---------47:14----------
mind is like you better make sure like


---------47:16----------
you're not going to give yourself


---------47:17----------
any me time if your mind says you need


---------47:20----------
to make sure


---------47:21----------
dot dot dot because in the meantime i'm


---------47:22----------
guessing goes out the window


---------47:25----------
we haven't even talked about it but i'd


---------47:26----------
also guess that you know you said two


---------47:28----------
two hours


---------47:28----------
two years ago you're saying you would


---------47:30----------
work for 24 hours at a stretch


---------47:32----------
no work-life balance and i'd guess that


---------47:34----------
the main thing was that you had to make


---------47:36----------
sure


---------47:38----------
you had to make sure this went okay this


---------47:40----------
goes back to your partner business where


---------47:41----------
like you're kind of like i can't really


---------47:43----------
trust anyone right because


---------47:45----------
you have to make sure that everything is


---------47:47----------
okay


---------47:48----------
yeah so what i feel so like for me it's


---------47:51----------
also


---------47:52----------
i guess there's also a feeling of like i


---------47:53----------
have to be in control of myself and i


---------47:56----------
can't just you know


---------47:57----------
deconstruct my feelings and myself in


---------47:59----------
front of somebody else i don't want to


---------48:00----------
i guess there's also a feeling of i


---------48:02----------
don't need i don't want to feel like i


---------48:03----------
ever have to rely on


---------48:05----------
even if it's in like a roman


---------48:06----------
relationship like i want to feel like if


---------48:09----------
if something ever happens in that right


---------48:10----------
like god forbid like a partner passes


---------48:13----------
away or something you know what i mean


---------48:14----------
like


---------48:14----------
acts of god that i can at least


---------48:16----------
compartmentalize and like make sure that


---------48:18----------
i'm still


---------48:19----------
me yeah so so i think that's a great


---------48:22----------
example right so because i think here's


---------48:23----------
the thing


---------48:25----------
you can't make sure that acts of god


---------48:27----------
won't happen


---------48:29----------
absolutely so what can you make sure


---------48:34----------
i can see in front of me and i feel like


---------48:35----------
i can control right like what i think is


---------48:37----------
within my grasp you know


---------48:39----------
so i'm gonna i'm gonna jump a little bit


---------48:40----------
here okay so what you can


---------48:42----------
make sure of is that you don't fall in


---------48:44----------
love with someone that acts of god can


---------48:46----------
take away from you


---------48:47----------
right lord i made that mistake yeah


---------48:52----------
yeah have your phones


---------48:55----------
i fell in love with uh individuals with


---------48:57----------
your health


---------48:58----------
that you know i don't want to elaborate


---------49:02----------
further because i don't want to like you


---------49:03----------
know


---------49:04----------
expose what they have but point is it's


---------49:07----------
it's terminal and i guess i knew that


---------49:11----------
going ahead of time like falling in love


---------49:12----------
with somebody knowing years later that


---------49:14----------
they would be gone


---------49:15----------
exactly the smartest thing i could have


---------49:16----------
done but you know emotions are emotion


---------49:18----------
they tend to happen and


---------49:21----------
i made that mistake you know


---------49:24----------
in life they're still fine now don't


---------49:26----------
worry like they have a few more years to


---------49:28----------
go


---------49:31----------
yeah that was you know it's a rare thing


---------49:34----------
when i say something like that is like a


---------49:35----------
hypothetical


---------49:37----------
no this person has a well i'll tell you


---------49:40----------
this person has a


---------49:42----------
pot so it's uh tachycardia it's really


---------49:45----------
bad


---------49:46----------
um they have a couple more syndromes


---------49:47----------
regarding it like long qt and everything


---------49:49----------
of that nature so


---------49:50----------
for them the they've had to get like


---------49:53----------
sinus note surgery modifications like


---------49:55----------
burning on their hearts and things like


---------49:57----------
that


---------49:58----------
uh doctors have told doctor specialists


---------50:00----------
who are trained in this field have


---------50:02----------
started to you know give up and


---------50:03----------
sort of give like end of life uh you


---------50:06----------
know i have to be told about like what a


---------50:07----------
dnr is like a do not resuscitate order


---------50:10----------
i don't know it's it's at the end stages


---------50:12----------
and that's um


---------50:14----------
it's a lot more common i guess than one


---------50:15----------
can expect you know people are going


---------50:17----------
through it they just don't really like


---------50:18----------
to talk about it


---------50:19----------
very similar to how i don't like to talk


---------50:20----------
about what my head is doing people don't


---------50:22----------
like to ever talk about their


---------50:24----------
physical ailments until you end up


---------50:25----------
getting to love them and you know


---------50:27----------
that comes out


---------50:31----------
sorry i need a minute to process that i


---------50:33----------
was not expecting that one


---------50:36----------
how are you feeling when i say i need a


---------50:38----------
moment to process is it more of like oh


---------50:39----------
my god like i know i know i know you're


---------50:41----------
i know it's definitely like you know a


---------50:43----------
lot to deal with


---------50:44----------
it's still a lot to deal with mentally


---------50:45----------
in my head realizing somebody of my age


---------50:47----------
is going through that


---------50:49----------
um especially somebody i still very


---------50:51----------
deeply care about but you know


---------50:53----------
can i ask you questions about


---------50:56----------
no i i have no interest in in digging


---------50:59----------
into that person's privacy but


---------51:01----------
right now i i can ask you about my side


---------51:04----------
of the


---------51:04----------
yeah yeah connection to that yeah yeah


---------51:07----------
okay


---------51:13----------
um yeah can you tell me how old you were


---------51:17----------
when you met this person


---------51:20----------
i would say that i was 24


---------51:25----------
24. so three years ago


---------51:30----------
and that's uh can can you tell me a


---------51:33----------
little bit about


---------51:35----------
how you it sounds like you fell in love


---------51:40----------
yeah you know we sort of met we hung out


---------51:42----------
for a bit and


---------51:43----------
eventually we shared some common


---------51:45----------
interests


---------51:46----------
uh you know she became much she became


---------51:49----------
my girlfriend


---------51:50----------
that's pretty much what it comes down to


---------51:52----------
but uh you know


---------51:53----------
around that time she told me very much


---------51:55----------
before we ever got together that she was


---------51:57----------
going through all of this and all of you


---------51:58----------
know


---------51:59----------
these health issues and at the time it


---------52:01----------
wasn't it wasn't as severe as it is now


---------52:03----------
so i was always in my head like ah


---------52:05----------
you'll get


---------52:07----------
positivity right i'm like you have the


---------52:08----------
best doctor care in the world you'll be


---------52:10----------
fine


---------52:11----------
and uh now it's also to a point where


---------52:14----------
you know the best doctors in the world


---------52:16----------
couldn't do it right god's calling her


---------52:17----------
home that kind of [ __ ]


---------52:18----------
so yeah


---------52:22----------
how do you how do you feel right now


---------52:26----------
sharing that


---------52:28----------
i feel really [ __ ] sad that i'm about


---------52:30----------
to lose someone as


---------52:32----------
it's in my head there's nothing that i


---------52:34----------
feel like personally is happening to me


---------52:35----------
like you know i'm being


---------52:37----------
affected mentally because of it because


---------52:38----------
in my head i'm just realizing


---------52:40----------
as much as it affects me right like you


---------52:43----------
know that's


---------52:44----------
i would say inconsequential to the


---------52:46----------
physical health of this other person


---------52:48----------
right


---------52:49----------
you know even if like it's hard to see


---------52:52----------
somebody in that situation you know what


---------52:53----------
i mean like i don't want to see


---------52:55----------
somebody in that situation even wherever


---------52:56----------
i care about and so i try to like


---------52:58----------
distance myself in a way as much as i


---------53:00----------
can


---------53:02----------
you know by burying myself in work or a


---------53:04----------
hobby or something but then like


---------53:06----------
you know you can't completely do that


---------53:07----------
you can't completely ignore the world


---------53:09----------
around you


---------53:10----------
so i look at that


---------53:13----------
and i guess i get really angry seeing


---------53:15----------
that that's happening to somebody i care


---------53:16----------
about somebody


---------53:17----------
a very young age you know in their


---------53:20----------
mid-20s like me


---------53:23----------
it's like what the [ __ ] you know like


---------53:26----------
i guess i'm more angry than i am


---------53:27----------
thinking about myself because i don't


---------53:29----------
really matter in the


---------53:29----------
scheme of thing when it when i'm looking


---------53:32----------
at you know somebody go through sailing


---------53:34----------
they're about to go die and you know


---------53:37----------
i'm about to you know live on in the


---------53:39----------
world


---------53:40----------
while losing somebody so what right do


---------53:42----------
you have to complain


---------53:44----------
yeah right exactly like i'm sitting over


---------53:46----------
here


---------53:47----------
and you know i'm not dying with a


---------53:49----------
functioning heart


---------53:51----------
yeah right like i'm not dead you know i


---------53:53----------
get to i get to see tomorrow i get to


---------53:55----------
see


---------53:56----------
our acts of god 2022 2023 and beyond


---------54:00----------
you know this person is at the end you


---------54:02----------
know


---------54:04----------
i mean there was a period of my life


---------54:06----------
where i actually thought i could have it


---------54:07----------
like i could have had like


---------54:08----------
family something going forward right


---------54:10----------
like it could have worked past it could


---------54:11----------
have been everything


---------54:12----------
i i had i had a i had a brief moment of


---------54:15----------
like


---------54:16----------
i could have like you know really i


---------54:17----------
could settle down for once and then


---------54:19----------
things started messing up and we ended


---------54:22----------
up growing apart


---------54:24----------
you know because of my work and


---------54:25----------
everything


---------54:27----------
that was it you know do you do you talk


---------54:30----------
to her


---------54:32----------
oh yeah here and there you know we have


---------54:34----------
uh you know it's not like we


---------54:35----------
stopped communicating fact i'm


---------54:39----------
one of the few people aside from her


---------54:40----------
parents she'll communicate to about


---------54:42----------
health issues right i guess i'm like an


---------54:44----------
emergency contact


---------54:46----------
so that tends to happen does she know


---------54:50----------
how much she means to you yeah


---------54:53----------
i tell her that yeah i tell her that you


---------54:56----------
know at the end of the day i wish


---------54:58----------
things could have been different but uh


---------55:01----------
you know they're not


---------55:04----------
does she get to see strong muda or weak


---------55:08----------
muda


---------55:10----------
i don't think she's ever seen weak muta


---------55:12----------
to be honest with you it's been we


---------55:13----------
weren't


---------55:14----------
long enough together for her to ever see


---------55:15----------
me like


---------55:17----------
i think in a lot of ways when i saw her


---------55:19----------
in the way that she was and i saw her


---------55:21----------
physical like


---------55:22----------
you know issues her terminal issues like


---------55:24----------
you know health problems i'd never ever


---------55:26----------
wanted to show her


---------55:27----------
muta because i was like this [ __ ] on a


---------55:30----------
daily basis


---------55:31----------
and she was already really strong you


---------55:33----------
know like dealing with all of her


---------55:34----------
illnesses


---------55:35----------
when you're putting a smile on your face


---------55:37----------
after the specialists have told you


---------55:39----------
no i don't know if i could know you know


---------55:42----------
what i mean i don't know if i


---------55:43----------
i recently had appendicitis surgery


---------55:45----------
right and i remember waking up in


---------55:46----------
recovery and the doctor like


---------55:48----------
was telling me we did your blood test uh


---------55:49----------
you're gonna have to stay another day


---------55:51----------
i was losing in my mind i'm like die you


---------55:53----------
know what i mean like what is he saying


---------55:54----------
right and i mean


---------55:56----------
that was like inconsequential compared


---------55:58----------
to like this right like i was like


---------55:59----------
i was i was in a recovery i was going to


---------56:01----------
come out just fine but then i look at


---------56:02----------
her situation and it's like the doctors


---------56:04----------
the specialists are telling her okay we


---------56:06----------
should be discussing eol and all this


---------56:08----------
nonsense only dude that would have


---------56:09----------
completely broken me mentally i don't


---------56:11----------
know if i could have done it i think at


---------56:13----------
that point i would


---------56:14----------
prefer that they stuck some cyanide in


---------56:16----------
me and like ended it right there but i


---------56:17----------
mean if you're still putting on a smile


---------56:19----------
and you're still fighting through it and


---------56:20----------
[ __ ] if you're still exercising day in


---------56:22----------
and day out because of it


---------56:23----------
you're you're stronger man than i a


---------56:25----------
stronger person than i you know


---------56:27----------
so uh when it came to being with her


---------56:30----------
i always had to put on like an extra


---------56:32----------
smile i guess so to speak like i had to


---------56:34----------
bring out the extra smile just so that


---------56:36----------
you know since i knew this person was


---------56:38----------
already putting so much effort into


---------56:40----------
keeping sane themselves i didn't want to


---------56:41----------
bring them down


---------56:43----------
right like that's the last thing like


---------56:45----------
we're in a relationship i don't want to


---------56:46----------
like you know drag you down


---------56:48----------
you know if you're working so hard to be


---------56:50----------
where you're at and also in a way


---------56:51----------
dragging


---------56:52----------
too


---------56:57----------
i'm gonna need a minute i don't know


---------57:00----------
this is this is quite the curveball it's


---------57:02----------
not what i was expecting


---------57:03----------
yeah well


---------57:07----------
it's a it's an interesting it's an


---------57:08----------
interesting like point man because


---------57:10----------
when we're talking about the loss of


---------57:12----------
loved ones isil


---------57:14----------
it all sort of ties back to that


---------57:15----------
beginning right like the loss of loved


---------57:17----------
ones


---------57:18----------
i mean you're the psychologist but i


---------57:20----------
know there's never like a one track


---------57:22----------
answer to any of this


---------57:23----------
there's never like a one straight up


---------57:24----------
solid answer to how to deal with


---------57:26----------
for impending doom or any of this nature


---------57:30----------
what makes it there isn't one solid


---------57:32----------
answer


---------57:33----------
because because human beings aren't you


---------57:35----------
know computers right there's no like one


---------57:37----------
program you can run and you get


---------57:39----------
a finite result at the end right like


---------57:41----------
the brain is different


---------57:42----------
um and again i'm not a psychologist but


---------57:44----------
i like to think that human beings are


---------57:45----------
much more complex than you


---------57:48----------
we let on so it's like when it comes to


---------57:50----------
grief everyone goes through it in a


---------57:52----------
different way


---------57:53----------
who knows that's where my mind is


---------57:56----------
okay


---------58:03----------
so there are a couple of different


---------58:05----------
directions i'm i'm honestly mood i'm


---------58:07----------
gonna need your help


---------58:08----------
and and i hope you're not getting this


---------58:10----------
is like um


---------58:12----------
you know like you're so messed up that i


---------58:14----------
can't it it's really more about


---------58:15----------
that no i i know okay okay so so i it's


---------58:19----------
really just about choice because i think


---------58:20----------
there are a couple of uh


---------58:22----------
they're just a couple of really


---------58:23----------
important conversations that we could


---------58:25----------
have


---------58:25----------
from this point forward and and i i'm


---------58:28----------
having trouble


---------58:29----------
choosing and i was hoping you could help


---------58:30----------
me pick


---------58:32----------
okay so one is you know we could talk


---------58:35----------
more about your


---------58:36----------
friend who it sounds like is terminally


---------58:38----------
ill


---------58:46----------
which and and


---------58:49----------
relating to that there's just that


---------58:53----------
we could talk about that we can also


---------58:55----------
talk a little bit about and also


---------58:56----------
relating to that like


---------58:58----------
i think there's a important conversation


---------59:00----------
to be had about


---------59:02----------
showing weakness um


---------59:05----------
and and i know it sounds kind of weird


---------59:07----------
but like


---------59:08----------
i've worked with like terminal cancer


---------59:10----------
patients uh


---------59:12----------
mostly cancer and and sometimes you know


---------59:15----------
the family's trying to be like really


---------59:16----------
really strong for this person


---------59:18----------
but like actually what like


---------59:21----------
everyone's just pretending to be part of


---------59:24----------
a play


---------59:24----------
where like no one is being authentic and


---------59:27----------
it really doesn't


---------59:28----------
like it can actually be like really


---------59:30----------
wonderful to let


---------59:33----------
people who you care about know that life


---------59:35----------
is hard for you to


---------59:37----------
it can actually be like really really


---------59:38----------
healing to i know it sounds kind of


---------59:40----------
weird but have the terminally ill person


---------59:42----------
comfort you


---------59:44----------
like it can mean a lot to them it can


---------59:46----------
mean a lot to you


---------59:47----------
like and it's kind of weird but you kind


---------59:50----------
of feel like they're the only ones that


---------59:51----------
need support whereas


---------59:53----------
i i know you know for a lot of people if


---------59:55----------
you really think about love like what is


---------59:57----------
someone you know you want to take care


---------59:58----------
of her


---------60:00----------
and presuming she feels the same way


---------60:01----------
like she wants to take care of you so in


---------60:03----------
a weird way one of the nicest things you


---------60:05----------
can do for her is to


---------60:06----------
let her take care of you


---------60:09----------
so there's a there's a conversation


---------60:11----------
there if you want to talk more about


---------60:12----------
that that's fine i've also


---------60:14----------
noticed that um you know you're


---------60:17----------
talkative


---------60:18----------
and and so i think we can just kind of


---------60:20----------
meander a little bit


---------60:22----------
um yeah we can meander and and you can


---------60:26----------
just


---------60:26----------
i'm happy to just listen because i think


---------60:28----------
you're saying a lot of


---------60:29----------
important things that need to be said


---------60:32----------
and


---------60:33----------
the third thing that that i was which is


---------60:35----------
sort of what i was originally kind of


---------60:37----------
hinting at when i


---------60:38----------
offered this hypothetical but was just


---------60:41----------
sort of trying to understand like where


---------60:43----------
does making sure


---------60:44----------
come from like where does that complex


---------60:47----------
in your mind


---------60:49----------
if i were to call it something i'd call


---------60:50----------
it the making sure monster


---------60:52----------
because it's interesting because you say


---------60:53----------
like my brain won't let me which then


---------60:56----------
begs the question what is your brain and


---------60:58----------
what are you


---------60:59----------
but i i think what we're really talking


---------61:01----------
about is like it's the making sure


---------61:02----------
monster right so if you sit down and you


---------61:04----------
do nothing for 15 minutes


---------61:06----------
the making sure monster will be like no


---------61:08----------
no like you should be doing something


---------61:09----------
that way we can make sure


---------61:12----------
that something you know that this will


---------61:14----------
go well tomorrow


---------61:16----------
so it's you know we can kind of


---------61:19----------
leave it up to rng we can go down


---------61:22----------
talking about


---------61:23----------
you know loss of loved ones and and sort


---------61:25----------
of what makes it hard for you to express


---------61:27----------
vulnerability


---------61:28----------
or we can talk about the origins of the


---------61:30----------
making sure monster


---------61:32----------
i feel like if i do the making sure


---------61:33----------
monster i'll be able to learn about


---------61:34----------
myself more


---------61:36----------
i'd rather i want to deal with the


---------61:38----------
making sure monster


---------61:40----------
i feel like that's a mentality that's


---------61:41----------
going to be the hardest thing i've ever


---------61:43----------
done in my life


---------61:43----------
to get out of yep i i would agree i


---------61:46----------
think that's going to be the most useful


---------61:48----------
so let me ask you something how long


---------61:49----------
have you been making sure


---------61:54----------
fifteen sixteen okay


---------61:57----------
you sure it's not even before that


---------62:11----------
wow you're really you're really getting


---------62:12----------
me about elementary school all of a


---------62:14----------
sudden


---------62:15----------
jesus you're getting me all the way back


---------62:17----------
to the sixth grade with that


---------62:19----------
i wouldn't say it was like as insane but


---------62:21----------
yeah i guess i was making sure since


---------62:24----------
tell me about the sixth grade


---------62:27----------
sixth grade um we ended up moving for a


---------62:31----------
bit like couple months


---------62:32----------
and uh this is a time when i was moving


---------62:35----------
back and forth from canada


---------62:37----------
and the states and there's a period when


---------62:40----------
i got into canadian school again


---------62:41----------
that they told me that i was going to


---------62:43----------
fail the sixth grade because i guess


---------62:44----------
things were going to try


---------62:45----------
maybe i had to do a read and


---------62:49----------
i remember my parents being there with


---------62:51----------
the teacher that day


---------62:53----------
we were having this long discussion and


---------62:57----------
my parents they weren't they weren't mad


---------63:00----------
at me but i thought they were you know


---------63:01----------
they thought it was like stupid how the


---------63:03----------
hell do you have to repeat the sixth


---------63:05----------
grade they never said it but in my head


---------63:06----------
that's the only thing that i could think


---------63:07----------
of right


---------63:09----------
i never asked them about that i never


---------63:10----------
bothered to


---------63:12----------
what am i going to ask my parents that


---------63:14----------
i'm i'm a [ __ ]


---------63:15----------
idiot so i didn't and it was at that


---------63:18----------
point i guess it's


---------63:19----------
great that i had to make sure that i go


---------63:22----------
to middle school right i go to the


---------63:23----------
seventh grade i go one more up


---------63:25----------
so i made sure by then


---------63:28----------
and i guess it wasn't i i hate to say


---------63:32----------
that i was making sure


---------63:33----------
ever since then because i don't think


---------63:35----------
the feeling is something that i


---------63:36----------
recognized until i was 15 and 16 when i


---------63:39----------
started


---------63:40----------
when i knew that i had the feeling but i


---------63:41----------
guess if i


---------63:43----------
sixth grade was that point


---------63:46----------
i honestly i i hate to say it but i also


---------63:50----------
very much remember i don't remember a


---------63:52----------
whole lot of my


---------63:53----------
life at this before the sixth grade


---------63:56----------
like i know that sounds weird to say


---------63:58----------
because people should have memories of


---------64:00----------
it but


---------64:01----------
i've lived such a blur at this point


---------64:02----------
that when i think you know like what was


---------64:04----------
grade five four


---------64:05----------
three two like i've forgotten like


---------64:07----------
teacher names at the point like i've


---------64:08----------
forgotten you know


---------64:09----------
every like i've forgotten you know the


---------64:11----------
final tales and i've also forgotten


---------64:15----------
well i've forgotten the course details


---------64:16----------
as well too i find that i can understand


---------64:18----------
but


---------64:18----------
i should be able to remember a chunk of


---------64:20----------
it were you worried about needing to


---------64:22----------
repeat a grade like did you have any


---------64:24----------
inkling before that conversation


---------64:26----------
with that teacher and your parents that


---------64:28----------
things could have gone wrong


---------64:31----------
um yeah i know when the teacher told me


---------64:33----------
right like my parents


---------64:34----------
and i had that but uh did i have any


---------64:38----------
like i think i was too young to


---------64:39----------
understand the idea of when i had


---------64:42----------
so i didn't know about that


---------64:45----------
oh sorry your voice clipped out there


---------64:47----------
for a second oh


---------64:49----------
uh yeah but i don't think that i i like


---------64:51----------
when my teacher told me that i had to do


---------64:53----------
it when my parents had to come in that's


---------64:54----------
when i knew i don't think i had a


---------64:56----------
realistic understanding of what it meant


---------64:58----------
like to repeat the grades


---------65:01----------
no no can you just tell me as much like


---------65:03----------
do you mind just telling me like a brief


---------65:05----------
story about


---------65:06----------
the sequence of events and like what you


---------65:08----------
remember like


---------65:09----------
i'd love to hear a little bit so what


---------65:12----------
are


---------65:12----------
like how it happened so for us when we


---------65:15----------
started this


---------65:16----------
when we started school again right in


---------65:17----------
like september and everything


---------65:19----------
um things were fine uh probably up until


---------65:23----------
november is when we had to like move to


---------65:25----------
the states and everything so we ended up


---------65:26----------
switching schools out into the states uh


---------65:28----------
this is around michigan


---------65:30----------
so we ended up going to michigan in the


---------65:32----------
sixth grade for me


---------65:33----------
i went to school there for a little bit


---------65:35----------
um until


---------65:36----------
february or whatever like this was you


---------65:38----------
know we immediately


---------65:39----------
uh and then around february


---------65:43----------
my dad you know had to move back to


---------65:46----------
canada for his job and everything right


---------65:47----------
and


---------65:48----------
initially i remember at the time that my


---------65:50----------
dad was moving back and forth like he


---------65:52----------
was coming back and forth from the


---------65:54----------
states and canada all the time


---------65:56----------
so eventually you know in that sixth


---------66:00----------
grade right like when i'm telling you


---------66:01----------
like november we moved with my dad


---------66:03----------
because we wanted you know i guess my


---------66:04----------
mom and dad wanted us to be sort of like


---------66:06----------
a family rather than my dad going out


---------66:07----------
and


---------66:08----------
hearing that when i came back you know


---------66:10----------
in february to school


---------66:12----------
i i guess the system was so different


---------66:15----------
that i may have had to repeat the sixth


---------66:18----------
grade because i was missing like a chunk


---------66:19----------
of the curriculum


---------66:20----------
um so around the time of you know


---------66:23----------
february when like this


---------66:24----------
came up right like and at this point


---------66:26----------
march had started to roll in and this


---------66:28----------
was a week before march break


---------66:30----------
so like my teacher you know they brought


---------66:32----------
in my parents they talked about what i'm


---------66:34----------
missing out of the curriculum so i


---------66:35----------
remember i had to read like two books


---------66:37----------
i had to do like a big like project a


---------66:40----------
big project you know


---------66:41----------
sixth grade project like something you


---------66:43----------
do over the weekend like put stuff on


---------66:44----------
cardboard paper or whatever i had to do


---------66:46----------
a bunch of these reports or whatever


---------66:47----------
basically i had to do the entire


---------66:49----------
curriculum


---------66:50----------
of six months school you know and i did


---------66:53----------
it all in march break like i


---------66:55----------
i i asked my teacher i'm like can i just


---------66:57----------
have all of what i missed


---------66:59----------
and can i just do it for you so i


---------67:00----------
remember i spent that entire march break


---------67:02----------
i didn't go outside and play or do


---------67:04----------
anything i literally


---------67:06----------
did a curriculum work right in march i


---------67:09----------
read literally like two books and back


---------67:11----------
then


---------67:12----------
you're in the sixth grade right like a a


---------67:13----------
book is like a book is like a commitment


---------67:16----------
you know yeah now it's like now it's


---------67:18----------
like nightly reading


---------67:19----------
so i'm doing this entire like do these


---------67:23----------
two book reports and i ended up getting


---------67:25----------
it done in like two


---------67:26----------
three weeks and it wasn't until the


---------67:29----------
end of that entire year now my teacher


---------67:32----------
was like no you'll be fine you're


---------67:34----------
you're going to the seventh grade like i


---------67:36----------
remember the day came


---------67:38----------
where we all went into a room the entire


---------67:40----------
sixth grade class


---------67:41----------
so it's like we were split right they


---------67:43----------
started to give us sort of this middle


---------67:44----------
school um


---------67:46----------
orientation where they split us up into


---------67:48----------
different classrooms they gave us like


---------67:50----------
lockers so they made us feel like we're


---------67:51----------
in middle school kind of going into high


---------67:53----------
school


---------67:54----------
and the last day of school they brought


---------67:56----------
us into the room it's like


---------67:57----------
congratulations


---------67:58----------
you all graduated that was the most


---------68:00----------
relaxing thing that i've ever heard in


---------68:01----------
my life because i knew


---------68:02----------
i knew when i knew in my head she was


---------68:04----------
talking to me you know


---------68:06----------
i knew in my head she had to she the


---------68:08----------
only reason she said that


---------68:10----------
is so that you could finally say okay


---------68:11----------
i'm getting through school i'm


---------68:12----------
graduating finally i'm not a total idiot


---------68:14----------
like


---------68:15----------
you know so so when they were like


---------68:17----------
assigning lockers and stuff did you


---------68:18----------
think that like


---------68:20----------
that stuff may not apply to you like it


---------68:22----------
applied to all of your clients


---------68:24----------
i mean for the longest time i was like i


---------68:26----------
was like what's the point of me doing


---------68:27----------
this i'm gonna have to repeat sixth


---------68:28----------
grade again so until the last day came


---------68:30----------
like you all graduated


---------68:31----------
and they gave us like our report cards


---------68:33----------
and like those brown envelopes and [ __ ]


---------68:35----------
i was like oh my god i succeeded i


---------68:38----------
i honestly to this day i've never even


---------68:40----------
asked anybody else if a teacher has said


---------68:42----------
that to him right like in the sixth


---------68:43----------
grade like it feels so foreign to me


---------68:45----------
is it normal for a sixth grade teacher


---------68:47----------
to tell the entire class you all


---------68:48----------
graduated


---------68:49----------
it's elementary school but i mean for me


---------68:51----------
a kid who's on like that verge of


---------68:52----------
failure


---------68:53----------
i guess from what i know congrats i


---------68:56----------
succeeded


---------68:57----------
and then i go into the seventh and


---------68:58----------
eighth grade and i wouldn't say that i


---------69:00----------
feel


---------69:00----------
this this uh moment of like um


---------69:04----------
i i guess i guess i'm not a feeling of


---------69:06----------
like making sure in the seventh or


---------69:07----------
eighth grade


---------69:08----------
but even when you go into the seventh


---------69:09----------
grade they're telling you all right


---------69:11----------
you're going to need this and this if


---------69:12----------
you want to go to high school because we


---------69:13----------
had like high schools we could apply to


---------69:15----------
back then like those


---------69:16----------
like uh i remember kathra uh the greater


---------69:19----------
toronto area was like this artsy sort of


---------69:21----------
like


---------69:21----------
college that people could apply to


---------69:23----------
gordon grayson was like a business


---------69:25----------
school that you could apply to um we


---------69:27----------
were talking about high school


---------69:28----------
applications back then bro


---------69:30----------
[ __ ] insanity if i'm gonna be honest


---------69:32----------
with you but


---------69:33----------
yeah that's what uh that's what we had


---------69:35----------
to that's what i was doing


---------69:36----------
back in the day it felt it dude i feel


---------69:39----------
like it was i grew up in like


---------69:40----------
india abroad you know because it's like


---------69:43----------
you know you hear all the stories of


---------69:44----------
like people back in india it's like


---------69:45----------
you need a 99 gpa to get into the best


---------69:47----------
indian universities imagine well i'm


---------69:49----------
like [ __ ] man


---------69:50----------
no one's getting that


---------69:54----------
it's kind of crazy right because i what


---------69:55----------
i'm really hearing is like


---------69:57----------
when before your your march break you


---------70:00----------
kind of have a sit down with your


---------70:01----------
parents


---------70:02----------
and and your parents what what are they


---------70:05----------
what did they say like i


---------70:08----------
do you remember i remember like my mom


---------70:11----------
was the one that was trying to like you


---------70:12----------
know rationalize she's like you gotta go


---------70:14----------
to


---------70:14----------
we're gonna talk to your teacher she's


---------70:16----------
going to give us all the schoolwork and


---------70:17----------
you're going to get it done you know


---------70:18----------
you're going to have you're going to


---------70:19----------
make sure that it's it's done right like


---------70:21----------
that's what you can do


---------70:22----------
my dad didn't really say anything to me


---------70:26----------
like i don't remember anything my mom


---------70:27----------
was the only one that walked me through


---------70:28----------
it because she's like


---------70:30----------
she is kind of like me she knows how to


---------70:32----------
you know break things down


---------70:33----------
flowchart your way through so that's


---------70:35----------
pretty much what my mom got me through


---------70:37----------
my dad didn't


---------70:38----------
say anything i asked him later on you


---------70:41----------
know


---------70:42----------
after you know my teacher was like


---------70:43----------
everyone graduated i'm like were you


---------70:45----------
guys ever mad at me my dad was like


---------70:47----------
no he understood everything


---------70:50----------
but uh it was it's also dude it's also


---------70:53----------
weird from a social perspective too


---------70:54----------
because when you're in the sixth grade


---------70:56----------
and you know your entire


---------70:57----------
grade because i grew up with some of


---------70:58----------
these people they're going a year ahead


---------70:59----------
of you


---------71:01----------
and now you're getting like last year's


---------71:02----------
kids coming up to you


---------71:04----------
yeah and everyone knows you're there


---------71:06----------
like makes you feel even dumber than you


---------71:08----------
usually are [ __ ]


---------71:10----------
yeah no i think it's quite humiliating


---------71:12----------
i'm wondering what is


---------71:14----------
what are you imagining also yeah yeah go


---------71:16----------
ahead and go ahead no i was just saying


---------71:17----------
like it's also kind of weird like


---------71:19----------
i've carried that mentality in in


---------71:20----------
college too because uh there was a


---------71:21----------
period where i did some continuing


---------71:23----------
education


---------71:24----------
and like it only became normal for me


---------71:26----------
when i ended up going


---------71:27----------
education i was like oh wow there's


---------71:29----------
people that are like 50 coming with me


---------71:30----------
okay


---------71:31----------
like my classmates are you know varying


---------71:33----------
ages people my i was me and my buddy


---------71:35----------
were like


---------71:36----------
one of my closest friends now as we're


---------71:37----------
one of the youngest people in our


---------71:38----------
continuing education courses because we


---------71:40----------
were doing like after effects


---------71:42----------
uh continuing education and like all of


---------71:44----------
our peers were like 40 45 so we're like


---------71:46----------
oh


---------71:47----------
okay it's normal yeah cool


---------71:49----------
[Music]


---------71:50----------
sorry i get too chatty about it when you


---------71:52----------
want me to describe something i will


---------71:53----------
describe it


---------71:54----------
no i think it's wonderful i think it so


---------71:57----------
i'm going to ask you kind of a weird


---------71:58----------
question


---------71:59----------
okay there's there's going to be a weird


---------72:00----------
question maybe weird emotions will come


---------72:02----------
up


---------72:03----------
what do you imagine your dad was feeling


---------72:05----------
during that meeting


---------72:07----------
think he took it on himself because i


---------72:10----------
think he i think he came to the


---------72:11----------
realization that him moving around a lot


---------72:13----------
cost us i think he even realized that


---------72:15----------
when


---------72:17----------
um i i think to an extent the


---------72:19----------
conversation he had where he told me


---------72:21----------
like


---------72:21----------
how do you know if you're going to be


---------72:22----------
alive so many so years


---------72:25----------
came up you know i think he has to know


---------72:28----------
like my dad's my dad's a smart guy he


---------72:30----------
knows


---------72:30----------
that he cost you know family that and i


---------72:32----------
feel terrible saying that because i feel


---------72:34----------
like i'm calling my dad a terrible


---------72:35----------
person for that [ __ ] but it's not


---------72:37----------
so the truth like we ended up fine you


---------72:39----------
know but i think my dad realized that


---------72:40----------
his actions


---------72:41----------
may have caused difficulty for me


---------72:44----------
growing up and even my brother like i


---------72:45----------
haven't


---------72:46----------
i've never talked brother about his


---------72:47----------
school he turned out just fine now


---------72:50----------
but i've never had that discussion too


---------72:52----------
so i feel like to an extent


---------72:53----------
my dad has to know he probably has that


---------72:56----------
in his head


---------72:57----------
so what dad doesn't realize yeah so what


---------73:01----------
what do you


---------73:02----------
what do you think about that how does


---------73:03----------
that how does it feel


---------73:05----------
that makes me feel worse though if i'm


---------73:07----------
making my dad go through that yeah


---------73:09----------
because like i feel like if my dad


---------73:10----------
thinks that way i'm like then i feel


---------73:12----------
like wow i guess i caught


---------73:13----------
it [ __ ] in a way and it's like it


---------73:15----------
doesn't even make any logical sense but


---------73:16----------
that's what my brain is doing too


---------73:18----------
yeah right so and and so


---------73:22----------
if you're strong for your dad


---------73:27----------
what does that do for him


---------73:30----------
i feel like that relaxes him in my head


---------73:32----------
like for me i look at my dad i'm like


---------73:34----------
okay you're getting old now so


---------73:36----------
i'm your oldest son so i gotta you know


---------73:38----------
step up and make sure that


---------73:40----------
the rest of your retirement days are


---------73:42----------
solid and relaxed you know like that's


---------73:43----------
what i'm so


---------73:44----------
to me my parents are the most important


---------73:46----------
thing yep i


---------73:48----------
i i do i go to bed like every once in a


---------73:51----------
while and i think of a day when they


---------73:53----------
eventually have to pass and everything


---------73:54----------
and i don't know how i like that's


---------73:56----------
uncopable in my head because i'm like


---------73:58----------
closest people i've ever had and it's


---------73:59----------
like regardless of what has happened


---------74:02----------
i don't know what i'll ever do you know


---------74:04----------
yeah so


---------74:06----------
you know how okay we're gonna really go


---------74:08----------
i'm gonna go


---------74:09----------
hunting now okay so i'm gonna ask you a


---------74:11----------
lot of specific and arguably leading


---------74:13----------
questions


---------74:14----------
okay let me know if it starts to feel


---------74:16----------
weird so


---------74:18----------
you said that you know you you said


---------74:20----------
several times actually during this


---------74:22----------
conversation


---------74:23----------
that you would have never let your dad


---------74:25----------
know that him moving around was hard on


---------74:27----------
you


---------74:29----------
yeah i don't think i would want to no


---------74:31----------
right so let's think a little bit about


---------74:34----------
why not because i feel like he'd blame


---------74:38----------
himself


---------74:39----------
okay yeah and slamming himself yeah no


---------74:44----------
wouldn't be good


---------74:45----------
for me when you say wouldn't be good for


---------74:48----------
you how would you


---------74:49----------
feel if your dad blamed himself yeah


---------74:52----------
i feel like i'm causing my dad some


---------74:54----------
level of grief when i could have just


---------74:56----------
kept it to myself and maybe


---------74:58----------
in blissful ignorance life would have


---------75:00----------
moved on and


---------75:01----------
all this would have been a memory


---------75:05----------
okay so i know it sounds kind of weird


---------75:08----------
and now i'm gonna


---------75:09----------
look for a particular answer so when you


---------75:11----------
don't tell your dad about what your


---------75:13----------
experience is when you don't open up to


---------75:15----------
him


---------75:16----------
what are you doing


---------75:20----------
i'm lying to you you're sure you're


---------75:23----------
lying so the word i was looking for is


---------75:25----------
protect


---------75:27----------
yeah what do you think about that


---------75:35----------
i want to say protect but literally we


---------75:37----------
just had a conversation


---------75:39----------
not five minutes ago where i know that


---------75:41----------
in his you know what he's done


---------75:42----------
moving around and everything so it's


---------75:44----------
like what am i protecting him from the


---------75:46----------
fact that


---------75:46----------
excellent am i protecting him from like


---------75:48----------
him i know


---------75:50----------
the reality of this okay i feel like in


---------75:52----------
some ways when i lie to him


---------75:54----------
i'm feeling like an idiot because he


---------75:55----------
knows what like he's not


---------75:57----------
so yeah some days what am i even doing


---------76:00----------
okay let's just go on with it yep so so


---------76:03----------
this is where it was adaptive at one


---------76:05----------
point it's not stupid it's just


---------76:07----------
maladapted because i think this is like


---------76:11----------
literally that this this is a pattern i


---------76:14----------
see a lot where like


---------76:15----------
when sometimes our parents in a sense do


---------76:18----------
the best that they could right like your


---------76:19----------
dad did the best he could


---------76:21----------
oh absolutely and and you love him and


---------76:24----------
respect him for all the sacrifices he


---------76:25----------
made and it


---------76:26----------
can't have been easy like for him to


---------76:27----------
have to move you know every six months


---------76:29----------
to like


---------76:30----------
michigan canada was rough right yeah


---------76:33----------
and and who bore the brunt of the


---------76:36----------
situation that


---------76:38----------
he was in


---------76:42----------
i mean i i don't know what his work life


---------76:44----------
was ever like


---------76:46----------
you know i don't know what he was doing


---------76:47----------
in the professional career


---------76:49----------
you know what i mean like i was too


---------76:50----------
young and i never asked i i don't know


---------76:53----------
dealing what but i knew at the time like


---------76:56----------
my mom was dealing with you know


---------76:58----------
because at one point dude it felt like


---------77:00----------
she was a single mom for a while you


---------77:01----------
know what i mean like


---------77:03----------
literally when you see your dad like one


---------77:05----------
weekend out of the month


---------77:07----------
you know you're way closer to your mom


---------77:10----------
felt like she was super alone


---------77:13----------
me and my brother were just on my own


---------77:16----------
too


---------77:16----------
you know like we were just doing our


---------77:18----------
life the way that we did it we never had


---------77:20----------
like


---------77:20----------
say family normality and


---------77:24----------
have like i guess everyone around me i


---------77:26----------
must


---------77:27----------
be with their mom and dad i was just


---------77:30----------
always with my mom and


---------77:32----------
even then i was always doing schoolwork


---------77:34----------
or


---------77:36----------
you know all that [ __ ]


---------77:40----------
even the time when like i moved around


---------77:41----------
and we lit my dad dr


---------77:43----------
work in that period


---------77:46----------
it's like how do you how do you like how


---------77:48----------
do you just make everything


---------77:50----------
you're cutting out sorry sorry oh i'm


---------77:53----------
sorry i don't i think it might be


---------77:54----------
but it's like how do you move in like


---------77:57----------
how do you move


---------77:58----------
together as a family right and then make


---------78:00----------
it normal in a day


---------78:01----------
right like how do you act like of how do


---------78:04----------
you like


---------78:04----------
participate in family activity after


---------78:07----------
like like


---------78:07----------
when we moved in november together and


---------78:09----------
we started living


---------78:10----------
it's like okay what's going on


---------78:14----------
right like i guess we're together now


---------78:16----------
let's


---------78:17----------
we'll be yeah it's like it feels pretty


---------78:20----------
artificial


---------78:22----------
the event honestly it still feels


---------78:24----------
artificial to this day even like


---------78:26----------
even going all the way up to now like


---------78:29----------
just


---------78:30----------
i would say in a matter of like a few


---------78:31----------
years ago i started becoming closer to


---------78:33----------
my family because there was a point


---------78:34----------
where like


---------78:36----------
i left like college you know like i left


---------78:40----------
and went into the world and lived my


---------78:41----------
life and now i'm more


---------78:43----------
participant in my family at least direct


---------78:45----------
family um


---------78:47----------
now like years ago but it's like how do


---------78:49----------
you how do you how do you get back to


---------78:51----------
normal


---------78:52----------
like how do you make something that you


---------78:54----------
know isn't normal like


---------78:56----------
we're we're gonna help you with that


---------78:58----------
yeah okay


---------78:59----------
so why do things in a family feel


---------79:01----------
artificial


---------79:04----------
why because they are artificial


---------79:10----------
okay right simple


---------79:13----------
yeah and and so i know it sounds kind of


---------79:16----------
weird but like muda what i get the sense


---------79:18----------
of is that like there's a lot


---------79:19----------
hanging between you and your dad


---------79:24----------
and so like sometimes like like there's


---------79:26----------
a lot behind


---------79:28----------
what he told you like you know he's like


---------79:29----------
you don't even know if you're gonna be


---------79:30----------
alive when you're 40 right like


---------79:32----------
that i'm sure that it's important for


---------79:35----------
him to say it sounds like it's a really


---------79:36----------
important conversation


---------79:37----------
but do you get how like that's the


---------79:40----------
output and there's a lot of like


---------79:42----------
number crunching behind what he says


---------79:47----------
like does that make sense


---------79:51----------
there was a lot more to his answer to me


---------79:54----------
that he was thinking that i just never


---------79:56----------
picked up on you yeah right so like


---------79:58----------
like your dad doesn't just show up to


---------80:00----------
you and he's like


---------80:01----------
hey where'd you have for lunch today


---------80:03----------
cool yeah


---------80:04----------
are you gonna be alive when you're 40


---------80:06----------
like what that's not


---------80:07----------
right so he's like thinking about


---------80:09----------
something


---------80:10----------
processing observing something within


---------80:13----------
you


---------80:14----------
and then decides to like give you this


---------80:16----------
particular package


---------80:19----------
yeah right so like he's been thinking


---------80:21----------
about this so like i think that what


---------80:23----------
i think the reason that there's some


---------80:24----------
amount of like artificiality


---------80:26----------
is because you guys are both


---------80:31----------
ignoring the same damn thing


---------80:34----------
and so like like you know and you guys


---------80:36----------
have learned how to do this for a while


---------80:38----------
because you all have been doing it now


---------80:39----------
for like what sounds like


---------80:40----------
you know a decade or two yeah where you


---------80:43----------
all have learned


---------80:44----------
you all have learned like not like


---------80:46----------
because like because it's interesting


---------80:48----------
right so you're you're


---------80:49----------
you watch game of thrones or have you


---------80:51----------
read the book i


---------80:53----------
have watched maybe episode one of game


---------80:55----------
of thrones i've never been into that


---------80:56----------
yeah anyway so so like you know if there


---------80:58----------
was a house of muda


---------81:00----------
the words would be so each house


---------81:03----------
has words right so your house words are


---------81:06----------
better dead than weak those are the


---------81:09----------
words of house


---------81:09----------
the slogan on the slogan on the house


---------81:11----------
yeah the slogan on the house exactly


---------81:13----------
like when you


---------81:14----------
walk in like that's what better dead


---------81:15----------
than weak and it's interesting right


---------81:17----------
because like when i hear that sixth


---------81:18----------
grade story like i


---------81:20----------
i totally get why your mind jumps there


---------81:21----------
because


---------81:23----------
you know you had a choice like you can


---------81:25----------
be like oh [ __ ]


---------81:26----------
can i do six months worth of work in two


---------81:29----------
weeks


---------81:30----------
i would rather be dead


---------81:34----------
yeah right so like well i mean i don't


---------81:36----------
wanna i don't wanna fail yeah


---------81:37----------
yeah right so like like i'm not gonna be


---------81:39----------
left behind like if i have to sacrifice


---------81:41----------
two weeks of my life


---------81:43----------
i'm doing book reports i'm i'm gluing


---------81:46----------
stationary stuff together i'm gonna i'm


---------81:48----------
working in a i'm in a sweatshop of my


---------81:50----------
own for two weeks yeah


---------81:51----------
absolutely and it's a sweatshop that


---------81:53----------
you've been in


---------81:55----------
since the sixth grade it's the boxing


---------81:59----------
ring


---------81:59----------
that we're round after round and never


---------82:02----------
around


---------82:02----------
there's no there's no like it's not even


---------82:04----------
like the round over chills out you know


---------82:06----------
i mean it's like you sound like you have


---------82:07----------
a


---------82:08----------
10 second break to drink water no you


---------82:09----------
just keep going with the blood


---------82:11----------
it's it's the sweatshop of your own


---------82:13----------
making and i think it's like i


---------82:14----------
because i i think back in the sixth


---------82:15----------
grade i realize i'm bouncing around a


---------82:17----------
lot right because i'm just gonna start


---------82:18----------
spitballing here but like i think you


---------82:20----------
kind of learned a really important


---------82:22----------
lesson back then


---------82:23----------
which is that you know it's it's really


---------82:26----------
interesting because it's that there's


---------82:27----------
circumstances outside of your control


---------82:30----------
and that your life can be screwed by


---------82:33----------
things that are like


---------82:34----------
completely like outside of there's


---------82:37----------
almost like a healthy amount of paranoia


---------82:39----------
which i can imagine


---------82:40----------
gets set in the mind at that point like


---------82:43----------
you just can't count on like you never


---------82:45----------
know


---------82:46----------
when your teacher is gonna call a


---------82:48----------
conference


---------82:49----------
like you never know and then


---------82:53----------
if you work really really hard


---------82:56----------
then you can like there's a way forward


---------82:59----------
and the only thing you have to sacrifice


---------83:01----------
is yourself and so like


---------83:04----------
there's there's a lot there in that


---------83:06----------
story about like


---------83:08----------
you know sort of being put into bad


---------83:10----------
situations because of other people


---------83:12----------
sort of not being able to rely on others


---------83:14----------
like


---------83:15----------
you know like your dad's sort of like


---------83:17----------
not really owning up to


---------83:21----------
you know like why you're in that


---------83:23----------
situation in the first place like not to


---------83:25----------
say that you shouldn't have done the


---------83:26----------
work or things like that and


---------83:27----------
it's not even to say that like he really


---------83:29----------
had much of a choice because you know


---------83:30----------
sometimes you just got to follow where


---------83:32----------
the work is


---------83:33----------
yeah but i think that's where like a


---------83:35----------
really healthy conversation at that


---------83:36----------
point


---------83:37----------
really could have been hey son i'm sorry


---------83:40----------
you're in this situation


---------83:41----------
we have to do this because of work i


---------83:44----------
love you a lot


---------83:46----------
i you know i know you can do the work


---------83:49----------
like i'm sorry to put you into this


---------83:51----------
situation


---------83:53----------
um but this is just the way that it has


---------83:55----------
to be right now


---------83:56----------
like what are you feeling as i say those


---------84:00----------
things


---------84:02----------
i've never heard that out of his mouth


---------84:04----------
actually


---------84:06----------
i wish i wish well i mean i've heard


---------84:08----------
half of that


---------84:10----------
i never really uh


---------84:15----------
yeah that uh that


---------84:18----------
god that perfectly exemplifies what you


---------84:20----------
know the whole situation was like


---------84:23----------
i know that he had to do his [ __ ] but


---------84:26----------
god some days i wish you wouldn't


---------84:29----------
yeah some days i kind of wish he


---------84:34----------
i kind of wish our family was god you


---------84:37----------
know i i t


---------84:38----------
i take living in absolute abject shitty


---------84:40----------
conditions


---------84:41----------
if it meant my family was more together


---------84:43----------
but


---------84:49----------
maybe that maybe that's why i keep


---------84:50----------
thinking you know in some ways if i ever


---------84:52----------
get to be a dad


---------84:52----------
if like if that day ever comes


---------84:56----------
i don't want to have to be the one


---------84:57----------
moving around i don't want to have to


---------85:00----------
i want to be able to you know have


---------85:03----------
everything


---------85:05----------
in the most perfect way that i can even


---------85:07----------
if that means


---------85:10----------
killing part of myself to achieve it you


---------85:12----------
know what i mean


---------85:13----------
sure what i'm hearing from you is you


---------85:16----------
want to make sure


---------85:17----------
that your children never have to go


---------85:19----------
through what you went through


---------85:21----------
absolutely and muda is well worth


---------85:25----------
sacrificing


---------85:26----------
for that yeah


---------85:29----------
100 i


---------85:33----------
uh you you 100


---------85:36----------
hit my mindset right there and you know


---------85:39----------
the thing is


---------85:40----------
i in a way i've i've even told myself


---------85:42----------
i'm like there's got to be something


---------85:43----------
wrong to


---------85:44----------
never i've never sat down and did the


---------85:46----------
original you know like


---------85:48----------
you know how you know you do like the uh


---------85:49----------
the good and bad you know sort of tea


---------85:51----------
table


---------85:52----------
i've never done that i've never come


---------85:53----------
across with bad i've always realized


---------85:56----------
it's always good for the people around


---------85:57----------
you it's always good if you have kids


---------85:59----------
for their


---------86:00----------
benefit growing up it doesn't really


---------86:02----------
matter tough through it


---------86:04----------
you've already done it so far what's


---------86:06----------
another few decades


---------86:08----------
right sure you know


---------86:12----------
so now we get to a really important


---------86:14----------
question right so


---------86:15----------
a little while ago i asked you do you


---------86:18----------
want this to change


---------86:20----------
and you said you remember what you said


---------86:24----------
about the what's going on so so


---------86:27----------
you were like yeah i think we're


---------86:29----------
probably rapping we're probably hitting


---------86:31----------
the limit because i think you've done a


---------86:33----------
lot of good work today


---------86:35----------
i'd love to tie it up for you a little


---------86:37----------
bit more but i think you should just


---------86:38----------
process this so i'm going to try to


---------86:40----------
summarize okay


---------86:41----------
and give us at least a stopping point


---------86:42----------
i'll make a couple recommendations


---------86:44----------
first is like when we talk about


---------86:47----------
better dead than weak gotta make sure


---------86:51----------
and you were like yeah this is the thing


---------86:52----------
that has been like running my life and i


---------86:54----------
want it to change


---------86:56----------
but now after we talk about it do you


---------86:58----------
want it to change


---------87:01----------
i don't think so no good right so now we


---------87:05----------
understand


---------87:06----------
because what is the and don't worry


---------87:08----------
we'll flip-flop you back and forth a


---------87:10----------
couple times okay


---------87:11----------
so like because what would be the cost


---------87:13----------
of you changing


---------87:18----------
everyone around me right


---------87:21----------
so and and what we're thinking about is


---------87:23----------
like if you changed if you started to


---------87:24----------
become more indulgent like


---------87:27----------
you could be subject to the whims of the


---------87:29----------
world


---------87:30----------
right like this goes back to control


---------87:32----------
like you're not gonna give up the


---------87:33----------
[ __ ] control


---------87:34----------
that your dad did not have like you are


---------87:36----------
gonna move mountains to make sure


---------87:39----------
that like you're gonna make sure right


---------87:41----------
because it's like you're not gonna be in


---------87:43----------
that situation


---------87:44----------
where you have to do something that


---------87:46----------
could potentially hurt your kids


---------87:48----------
yeah [ __ ] that never


---------87:52----------
and so then the next question that i


---------87:54----------
have for you


---------87:56----------
is what do you think your kids will do


---------87:59----------
when they grow up if you do that


---------88:03----------
if i do what i'm doing right now what


---------88:06----------
are you gonna learn and what are you


---------88:07----------
gonna teach them


---------88:13----------
i mean if i if i had a kid i feel like i


---------88:16----------
could honestly


---------88:18----------
i feel like i pass on the same [ __ ] yep


---------88:20----------
i feel like i feel like i tell them like


---------88:22----------
honestly if i had a kid i would tell


---------88:25----------
them


---------88:26----------
life for people like for for you and me


---------88:29----------
and


---------88:30----------
our entire like everyone around us


---------88:32----------
you've only got yourself


---------88:34----------
like i'm here like if i have my kid i


---------88:36----------
tell them listen i'm here


---------88:38----------
in the ground after me you've got no one


---------88:40----------
else but yourself


---------88:42----------
no one else that you can rely on you


---------88:43----------
better learn to [ __ ]


---------88:45----------
dig your heels in the ground and make


---------88:47----------
something worthwhile or


---------88:49----------
die like the rest of okay


---------88:52----------
like yeah i


---------88:56----------
think that's what your dad taught you


---------88:57----------
right


---------89:00----------
because he's like you got to do like is


---------89:02----------
your dad


---------89:03----------
weak no


---------89:06----------
no i don't know no he's worked hard yeah


---------89:09----------
yeah right


---------89:10----------
like so he taught you that lesson too he


---------89:11----------
was like if you have to commute to


---------89:13----------
michigan


---------89:14----------
every single weekend that's what you do


---------89:16----------
to provide for your family i


---------89:18----------
i look at my dad like this you know he


---------89:20----------
went to medical school twice


---------89:21----------
one in india one over here could get


---------89:24----------
your medical


---------89:24----------
license in one part of the world you


---------89:27----------
don't get it carried over here so


---------89:29----------
yeah when i look at my dad and i look at


---------89:32----------
all he had to do like imagine


---------89:35----------
across the world at age 35


---------89:38----------
you're young but you know you're hitting


---------89:41----------
that middle age pretty [ __ ] quickly


---------89:43----------
you got a wife you got a kid you got


---------89:46----------
another kid on the way


---------89:47----------
[ __ ] you know you can either my dad


---------89:50----------
worked his


---------89:51----------
ass off when i was you know there were


---------89:53----------
days where


---------89:54----------
when we moved into the gta we lived in


---------89:58----------
an apartment in east toronto


---------89:59----------
and i got to see my dad once out of the


---------90:02----------
week


---------90:03----------
okay because back then to pay for


---------90:06----------
medical school again


---------90:07----------
he would have to pour it right so he


---------90:10----------
would drive from toronto all the way to


---------90:11----------
my


---------90:12----------
[ __ ] insane drive back and forth day


---------90:15----------
to day to day to day to day-to-day


---------90:18----------
and i i mean at one point the man


---------90:21----------
[ __ ] kills himself right like you


---------90:22----------
have no personality of nothing


---------90:24----------
you gotta do gotta do to money


---------90:27----------
to pay off these mounting debts he


---------90:29----------
taught and eventually


---------90:31----------
yeah yeah i'm gonna interrupt and


---------90:34----------
he taught you this lesson which you were


---------90:36----------
going to pass on to your children right


---------90:40----------
yeah and what is he trying to teach you


---------90:42----------
now


---------90:46----------
i feel like he's trying to teach me that


---------90:47----------
i have to i have to keep my [ __ ]


---------90:49----------
together


---------90:50----------
i have to stand on my own two feet


---------90:52----------
because there's not going to be anybody


---------90:53----------
else out there that's going to do it for


---------90:54----------
me


---------90:55----------
i also feel like you can't rely on


---------90:56----------
anyone so i i think if you pay attention


---------90:59----------
to his last conversation right when he


---------91:01----------
comes to you and he says you don't know


---------91:02----------
if you're going to be alive when you're


---------91:04----------
40.


---------91:05----------
[Music]


---------91:06----------
i think he's trying in his own way to


---------91:09----------
tell you that like


---------91:13----------
you know i'm not so sure


---------91:16----------
right like that sounds yeah because he's


---------91:18----------
lived it yeah because right


---------91:20----------
he's saying like he's actually saying


---------91:21----------
like don't be like me


---------91:29----------
dude i just feel like man after all this


---------91:31----------
[ __ ] i feel like the only


---------91:32----------
normal generation after


---------91:37----------
like as far as i feel like after like


---------91:39----------
this entire situation the only like


---------91:41----------
normal generation that i'll have a


---------91:43----------
chance to make their


---------91:44----------
own decisions and will have a chance of


---------91:46----------
normality in this part of the world


---------91:49----------
is the next generation after me i feel


---------91:51----------
like i'm already going


---------91:52----------
already going blow-by-blow you know


---------91:56----------
yeah to live that normal life that's


---------91:57----------
what i'm only worried about right


---------91:59----------
because i've already been past it my


---------92:00----------
childhood's gone you know i'm an adult


---------92:03----------
so i got to make sure it doesn't repeat


---------92:04----------
itself


---------92:07----------
yeah so there's more there right


---------92:11----------
there's a lot to talk about there which


---------92:12----------
is like i'm sorry if my mic keeps


---------92:14----------
cutting out by the way


---------92:15----------
um i just like i keep looking at the uh


---------92:18----------
discord light


---------92:20----------
so i don't know let me just yeah is it


---------92:22----------
better now


---------92:23----------
it look yeah it seems better yeah but um


---------92:26----------
i think sometimes it's when you move


---------92:27----------
around but so here's here's what i'd say


---------92:29----------
murder like


---------92:31----------
i know we've been at it for a little


---------92:32----------
while i think we've covered some good


---------92:33----------
stuff


---------92:34----------
um you know the next generation things


---------92:37----------
like that i i don't think your


---------92:38----------
generation is lost yet i also don't


---------92:40----------
think you're lost and i think you can


---------92:41----------
reclaim some of your childhood as well


---------92:44----------
but i want to leave you with a couple


---------92:45----------
things to think about okay


---------92:48----------
right first is i think you got to talk


---------92:49----------
to your dad


---------92:52----------
i think you got to have a lot of


---------92:53----------
conversations with him oh


---------92:55----------
yeah we do right so that that is


---------92:58----------
that you say that but man in my head


---------93:00----------
that's like the hardest thing to ever


---------93:02----------
achieve man to sit down with my dad and


---------93:03----------
have this discussion


---------93:05----------
holy [ __ ] dude i would rather architect


---------93:07----------
like entire server farms for a company


---------93:10----------
and get over this jesus christ that's


---------93:12----------
too much you know


---------93:13----------
yeah so the the good news is that you


---------93:15----------
know if you want to he can just watch


---------93:17----------
this


---------93:18----------
although i imagine you'll be terrified


---------93:20----------
of him watching


---------93:21----------
because yeah because it's going to be


---------93:23----------
hard to protect him if he listens to you


---------93:24----------
right


---------93:25----------
absolutely if he actually hears what you


---------93:27----------
have to say like you see that you


---------93:29----------
want to protect him you don't ever want


---------93:30----------
him to watch this and the reason you


---------93:32----------
don't want him to watch this is because


---------93:34----------
he may feel bad


---------93:36----------
oh absolutely yeah right so so you got


---------93:38----------
to be careful because i think i think in


---------93:40----------
order for you and your dad to like


---------93:41----------
really connect in the way that like


---------93:43----------
sounds important to me it's important to


---------93:46----------
me i you have to [ __ ] decide if it's


---------93:47----------
important to you but


---------93:49----------
you know i think it's about talking a


---------93:50----------
little bit about you know like because


---------93:52----------
there's i think there's a really healthy


---------93:54----------
way to have the conversation which is


---------93:55----------
sort of


---------93:56----------
you know you love him you respect him


---------93:58----------
you completely understand the sacrifices


---------94:00----------
he made he did the best that he could it


---------94:01----------
was really hard


---------94:03----------
and it also kind of sucked for you


---------94:07----------
and if he's if his narcissistic defense


---------94:09----------
mechanisms are


---------94:11----------
are up he'll get mad at you and he'll


---------94:14----------
say


---------94:14----------
you are grateful little blah blah blah


---------94:17----------
blah


---------94:18----------
right but but i think that the reason


---------94:20----------
that those


---------94:21----------
narcissistic defense mechanisms arise is


---------94:24----------
because


---------94:24----------
they arise to protect himself from his


---------94:28----------
own guilt


---------94:31----------
right and and so i think that like not


---------94:33----------
you don't have to blame him i i think


---------94:34----------
you can just


---------94:34----------
but but i think like it's it's i don't


---------94:36----------
like i don't blame my dad or anything of


---------94:38----------
that nature you know like at the end of


---------94:40----------
the day like i know


---------94:41----------
i i'm completely understanding of what


---------94:43----------
he's done you know like yeah


---------94:44----------
so it's not like my dad ruined my


---------94:46----------
childhood right of course


---------94:48----------
yeah so so i and i think if you want an


---------94:50----------
easy way


---------94:51----------
okay so i'm gonna try to protect your


---------94:53----------
brain


---------94:54----------
so like an easy way to enter into a


---------94:56----------
conversation with your dad is is that


---------94:59----------
you just revisit this conversation about


---------95:01----------
like are you going to be alive when


---------95:03----------
you're 40.


---------95:04----------
you just ask your dad questions like hey


---------95:05----------
dad like last week or a month ago or a


---------95:07----------
year ago or whenever he had it you


---------95:09----------
remember you told me this thing


---------95:10----------
i was hoping to understand that you


---------95:12----------
don't have to talk about feelings


---------95:14----------
you don't have to talk about the past


---------95:16----------
you don't have to demonstrate weakness


---------95:18----------
he doesn't have to demonstrate weakness


---------95:21----------
and then i would ask him so that's the


---------95:23----------
first question you feel okay asking that


---------95:24----------
question


---------95:27----------
yeah i can actually okay if it's like


---------95:29----------
purely non you know like no


---------95:31----------
confrontation nothing edges no


---------95:32----------
yep yep easy easy questions okay we're


---------95:34----------
gonna go nice and smooth so then the


---------95:36----------
next question is like


---------95:37----------
can you tell me a little bit about like


---------95:39----------
what you know when you


---------95:41----------
when i was your age like what was going


---------95:43----------
through your head about your life


---------95:45----------
and ask him like you know what it what


---------95:47----------
do you see like how do you see me living


---------95:49----------
my life what do you think about the way


---------95:51----------
i'm living my life what do you think i


---------95:52----------
you know because he's


---------95:53----------
saying that to you for a reason and how


---------95:56----------
did you live your life back then how did


---------95:57----------
you live your life in your 30s what was


---------95:59----------
it like to have to go through


---------96:00----------
like residency again or medical school


---------96:03----------
again yeah


---------96:04----------
you know and just ask him questions


---------96:06----------
about like his his upbringing and stuff


---------96:08----------
like that


---------96:09----------
and and then you know that's gonna be


---------96:10----------
safe


---------96:12----------
and then you know if you ever


---------96:16----------
are able to or he may go there


---------96:19----------
um you can also have a conversation


---------96:21----------
about you know what it was like growing


---------96:23----------
up and like


---------96:24----------
just try to understand his perspective


---------96:27----------
and and i think the closer you you the


---------96:30----------
the more he starts talking about


---------96:32----------
you growing up the closer y'all are


---------96:34----------
gonna get to emotions


---------96:36----------
and you have to decide whether you're


---------96:39----------
comfortable


---------96:40----------
talking about that does that make sense


---------96:43----------
yeah i know it


---------96:44----------
should lead the conversation into where


---------96:45----------
he was at my point in life and see what


---------96:48----------
you know similarities


---------96:49----------
and and you guys may have the ability to


---------96:51----------
just communicate with each other


---------96:54----------
without ever saying anything but i think


---------96:57----------
both of y'all need to know


---------96:58----------
that like like there's something needs


---------97:01----------
to happen between y'all


---------97:03----------
yeah no i i think i think it's to me


---------97:07----------
i feel like the way that i want this


---------97:08----------
conversation to go is i want to like


---------97:10----------
really talk about the commonalities we


---------97:12----------
had because i know he's been


---------97:13----------
he's worked hard around my age too so i


---------97:15----------
want to see like


---------97:16----------
yep why like i mean when you're talking


---------97:18----------
about this whole cycle repeating itself


---------97:20----------
like this


---------97:21----------
maybe it has repeated itself more


---------97:23----------
literally than i'm thinking right now


---------97:25----------
maybe maybe the parallels are just more


---------97:27----------
there than it ever was you know


---------97:29----------
yep yep and then i would i would also


---------97:32----------
share with him this may be actually


---------97:34----------
safer because in the context of that


---------97:36----------
conversation


---------97:37----------
you can even tell him sometimes


---------97:40----------
when i sit down and i like try to take a


---------97:42----------
break my mind tells me i should be doing


---------97:45----------
more work


---------97:46----------
what do you think about that just ask


---------97:48----------
him about that


---------97:50----------
oh i feel i feel like we'll come across


---------97:51----------
some real commonality because i know my


---------97:53----------
dad he's definitely one of those


---------97:54----------
anxious people too yeah yeah he can't


---------97:57----------
take a break either


---------97:58----------
yeah and so i'd say start there and i


---------98:01----------
think more


---------98:02----------
long term


---------98:05----------
this is going to be harder but it's


---------98:06----------
definitely doable it's going to take


---------98:08----------
some work


---------98:09----------
i think you have to learn how to like


---------98:11----------
not be so sure about stuff


---------98:13----------
right like i think you've got to learn


---------98:15----------
how to like let go a little bit


---------98:17----------
and and sort of know that you can do the


---------98:20----------
most that you can do


---------98:21----------
and you can do the best that you can do


---------98:23----------
but that like


---------98:24----------
[Music]


---------98:27----------
you know that trust trust not


---------98:30----------
in your ability to make things perfect


---------98:32----------
trust in your ability for damage control


---------98:35----------
so basically flowchart less is my life


---------98:38----------
right


---------98:39----------
instead of thing instead of waking up


---------98:40----------
every day thinking of every possible


---------98:42----------
action instead of making like


---------98:45----------
you know every like because because in


---------98:47----------
my head i think of every find it like if


---------98:48----------
i do this


---------98:49----------
it could you know lead to this or that


---------98:50----------
or this or that maybe instead of you


---------98:52----------
know making six or seventy


---------98:53----------
different little boxes have it all one


---------98:55----------
box as a


---------98:57----------
this could happen and i'm going to have


---------98:58----------
to learn to adapt to it regardless of


---------99:00----------
how it happens


---------99:01----------
yeah sort of so i wouldn't quite say


---------99:03----------
flowchart less but what i'd say is what


---------99:04----------
you need to learn how to do is tolerate


---------99:06----------
uncertainty because i think it's the


---------99:10----------
uncertainty that terrifies you and it's


---------99:12----------
it's a lot of you trying because like


---------99:15----------
muda what you are is a control freak


---------99:17----------
because


---------99:18----------
uncertainty you've learned that that


---------99:20----------
uncertainty is like


---------99:22----------
just way too painful and and over time i


---------99:25----------
think what you


---------99:26----------
need to really do otherwise you really


---------99:28----------
are going to pass this on to your kids


---------99:30----------
which i'm sure that you'll


---------99:32----------
i mean i'm not sure but i imagine you'll


---------99:33----------
have one day


---------99:35----------
um and i just think it's karmic it's


---------99:37----------
just


---------99:38----------
two too too much karma


---------99:42----------
in your life to not have children um


---------99:45----------
but like like i i think it's it you got


---------99:47----------
to be a little bit careful because you


---------99:49----------
have to understand that like some of


---------99:51----------
some of your aversion to uncertainty i


---------99:54----------
think has come out of experiences


---------99:56----------
that are like like because you learned


---------99:58----------
early on that [ __ ] is out of your


---------100:00----------
control


---------100:00----------
so like if you double down i mean that


---------100:02----------
sixth grade story is perfect because


---------100:03----------
it's like


---------100:04----------
random thing happens to you that could


---------100:06----------
screw over your life


---------100:08----------
yeah and all you have to do is sacrifice


---------100:10----------
yourself get into the ring


---------100:12----------
and then you can alter the course of


---------100:15----------
fate


---------100:17----------
and so that lesson is what you've


---------100:20----------
has become a part of your fabric you can


---------100:23----------
cost yourself


---------100:24----------
and you you don't have to like bring


---------100:26----------
other people in it just takes you to win


---------100:28----------
you know that's


---------100:29----------
exactly yeah and and so i think as you


---------100:31----------
kind of work on that it's going to


---------100:32----------
become


---------100:33----------
important for romantic relationships and


---------100:35----------
stuff like that but i'd say start with


---------100:36----------
your dad and you know


---------100:38----------
there's more conversations i don't know


---------100:40----------
if you've ever worked with a therapist


---------100:42----------
but i think this is definitely the kind


---------100:43----------
of stuff you can work with a therapist


---------100:45----------
i've never worked with a therapist


---------100:47----------
actually i've always


---------100:49----------
again like it goes back to what you said


---------100:51----------
before i like do i feel weak when i open


---------100:53----------
myself up i don't think i could


---------100:55----------
it's hard for me to like go sit in front


---------100:57----------
of anybody even if it's like so


---------100:59----------
personally detached from me like a


---------101:00----------
therapist who you know


---------101:02----------
i pay this person we sit down we talk


---------101:03----------
they professionally you know


---------101:05----------
respond to me it's still so difficult to


---------101:08----------
let them into your head you know


---------101:09----------
how has this been difficult oh it's been


---------101:12----------
incredible


---------101:13----------
well this whole thing hasn't been


---------101:14----------
difficult like i've been able to ease in


---------101:15----------
with you it's kind of like you know


---------101:16----------
buddy talking but


---------101:18----------
it's just um i feel like i feel like if


---------101:20----------
this is


---------101:22----------
this is professional i don't want to say


---------101:23----------
that what we're doing isn't it's you


---------101:25----------
know it's not professional but


---------101:27----------
if this was a real professional setting


---------101:29----------
like if i was sitting with you right now


---------101:31----------
and like


---------101:32----------
in like an office like laying down on


---------101:34----------
one of those you know like


---------101:35----------
you know therapist beds or whatever i


---------101:37----------
don't think i could do it man i think i


---------101:38----------
probably i would walk out i'd be like


---------101:40----------
you know what man


---------101:42----------
not for me i get up in 10 minutes i'll


---------101:45----------
be like bye


---------101:46----------
so so what what about doing this


---------101:49----------
in front of thousands of strangers on


---------101:51----------
the internet


---------101:52----------
makes it easier for you than doing it


---------101:54----------
alone in the privacy of a therapist oh


---------101:56----------
it's uh it's streaming i'll be real with


---------101:58----------
you when i first started streaming in


---------102:00----------
front of like a couple hundred people it


---------102:01----------
used to be a little anxiety inducing


---------102:03----------
uh you just get that that i will say you


---------102:05----------
just get used to after a while it


---------102:06----------
becomes like a number you look at like


---------102:08----------
whatever okay it's just


---------102:09----------
it's someone on like the other side of


---------102:11----------
the world cool it's not


---------102:12----------
it's it's it's also just i don't know i


---------102:15----------
just i've


---------102:16----------
i've gotten used to seeing those number


---------102:17----------
counts like it's it is what it is


---------102:19----------
okay how i know is me and you are


---------102:21----------
talking you know yeah so


---------102:23----------
i know it sounds weird but that's the


---------102:24----------
strange thing that i've discovered is


---------102:26----------
that like actually a lot of people feel


---------102:28----------
the same way you do


---------102:29----------
and that like almost doing it in the


---------102:31----------
privacy of a therapist's office


---------102:33----------
which you know you're right that this


---------102:35----------
isn't we're more you know we're both


---------102:37----------
like we're streaming here we're more


---------102:39----------
like content creator colleagues just


---------102:40----------
having a conversation but


---------102:42----------
there is something strange about you


---------102:44----------
know this being more accessible


---------102:46----------
even though in theory it should be like


---------102:47----------
way harder to do i don't understand it


---------102:49----------
myself


---------102:50----------
but i totally get what i'm saying like i


---------102:52----------
feel like i'm just talking to


---------102:53----------
a dude we're just chilling yeah you know


---------102:56----------
there's it's like in a way it's i think


---------102:58----------
it's like being there and you know why


---------103:00----------
you're there like you understood like


---------103:02----------
when we started this conversation we


---------103:03----------
didn't exactly have like


---------103:05----------
a plan set or what we were going to


---------103:07----------
attack or whatever right


---------103:08----------
you know we didn't like jump down into


---------103:10----------
this like this is what we're gonna cut


---------103:11----------
like it just sort of led into one


---------103:12----------
another and it is


---------103:13----------
it is what it is you know has it been


---------103:15----------
tougher at times during the conversation


---------103:17----------
yeah


---------103:18----------
has it been easier yeah but you know


---------103:19----------
it's a conversation i could go with it's


---------103:22----------
again i don't want to say it's not


---------103:23----------
professional but it's like you said it's


---------103:24----------
just two dudes talking like


---------103:26----------
yeah yeah yeah no i i think it's it's i


---------103:28----------
mean this is not


---------103:29----------
therapy or medical advice so you know


---------103:32----------
there's a legal disclaimer of that which


---------103:34----------
yeah but but i mean i think there's also


---------103:36----------
something different i think this is


---------103:38----------
where a lot of people get


---------103:39----------
confused because they sort of say like


---------103:41----------
because actually you know


---------103:42----------
to just be just to be perfectly honest i


---------103:44----------
would be saying and doing different


---------103:46----------
things if the two of us were in our


---------103:47----------
office and i was your doctor


---------103:49----------
i would actually be doing things quite


---------103:50----------
differently but um


---------103:53----------
uh but then the last thought is just you


---------103:56----------
know if you're interested


---------103:57----------
then i mean i would actually recommend a


---------103:59----------
therapist in your case but


---------104:00----------
um you know if that doesn't feel


---------104:02----------
comfortable to you


---------104:03----------
we do actually have a coaching program


---------104:06----------
for content creators


---------104:08----------
which they seem to you know so far the


---------104:11----------
content creators seem to be happy we can


---------104:12----------
send you some info if you're interested


---------104:14----------
but


---------104:14----------
i'd be interested in that yeah yeah so


---------104:17----------
it it's


---------104:18----------
some stuff around work-life balance and


---------104:20----------
and things like that but


---------104:21----------
any questions for me muta before we wrap


---------104:23----------
up i know we've been at it for a while


---------104:25----------
you've been doing a fantastic job by the


---------104:26----------
way


---------104:27----------
it's hard i know i i i i


---------104:30----------
honestly i feel like you're giving me


---------104:31----------
the road map to have a discussion with


---------104:33----------
my dad


---------104:34----------
at some point so when this lockdown is a


---------104:35----------
little more eased up i think i'll take


---------104:37----------
him out to dinner just me and him


---------104:39----------
somewhere and we'll have this


---------104:40----------
conversation


---------104:41----------
um that's that's the only thing i'm


---------104:43----------
looking like really


---------104:45----------
forward to actually now like i'm not so


---------104:47----------
much scared of doing that


---------104:49----------
uh i want to you know it's just


---------104:51----------
something that i feel like needs to


---------104:52----------
happen i feel like it needs to be


---------104:53----------
discussed either do it now


---------104:55----------
or yeah or you let it screw up another


---------104:57----------
you know section of your life


---------104:59----------
