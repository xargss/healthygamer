---------00:00----------
and so the first thing to understand is


---------00:01----------
that like as long as that process


---------00:04----------
can be improved then you will be a


---------00:06----------
better communicator okay


---------00:08----------
so to start with


---------00:10----------
let's understand this


---------00:12----------
okay


---------00:13----------
so why can't i talk like the way i do in


---------00:16----------
my mind this is such a great question


---------00:18----------
whenever i'm in my head rehearsing


---------00:19----------
speeches or conversations i talk so


---------00:21----------
eloquently and articulated but when it's


---------00:24----------
time to speak to


---------00:26----------
when it's time to come to speak with my


---------00:29----------
mouth i end up stumbling stuttering or


---------00:31----------
forgetting what i'm saying and about


---------00:34----------
to say


---------00:36----------
it happens to me a lot to the point


---------00:37----------
where i don't want to speak sometimes


---------00:38----------
and i wish i can talk like that


---------00:40----------
attractive chad inside my head


---------00:42----------
i do have anxiety and fear of judgment


---------00:44----------
along with adhd in case that affects it


---------00:46----------
why does this happen and how can we


---------00:47----------
train to overcome this does it have a


---------00:49----------
term


---------00:51----------
what a great question


---------00:52----------
so


---------00:54----------
a lot of times


---------00:55----------
we think thoughts in our head


---------00:57----------
and the thoughts in our head are so pure


---------00:59----------
so clean they make such perfect sense


---------01:02----------
and then our beautiful mind is like hey


---------01:04----------
let us share this brilliance with the


---------01:05----------
world


---------01:06----------
and then something happens somewhere


---------01:08----------
between the brilliance in your mind and


---------01:10----------
the words that come out of your mouth


---------01:12----------
something gets super garbled and it


---------01:14----------
comes out like a hot mess


---------01:16----------
and then people are super confused


---------01:18----------
because they're like why is this


---------01:19----------
happening i understood it it made so


---------01:20----------
much sense in my head i understood it so


---------01:23----------
well


---------01:23----------
in my head like what happened


---------01:26----------
okay


---------01:27----------
so


---------01:28----------
we're gonna talk a little bit about


---------01:32----------
um


---------01:33----------
you know why this happens


---------01:34----------
so to start off with


---------01:37----------
we have


---------01:41----------
thoughts that are kind of perfect in our


---------01:43----------
head right


---------01:44----------
so let's start with this like what part


---------01:46----------
of our brain


---------01:48----------
dictates speech right so we have like


---------01:51----------
our left hemisphere is very speech


---------01:52----------
oriented we have something that i'm just


---------01:54----------
going to go ahead and call the


---------01:55----------
linguistic cortex


---------01:56----------
so we have a part of our brain that like


---------01:58----------
chooses words and formulates like how to


---------02:01----------
say things


---------02:02----------
but the interesting thing is that


---------02:03----------
thoughts


---------02:05----------
are not restricted to the linguistic


---------02:07----------
cortex right so for example we have the


---------02:09----------
default mode network which is the part


---------02:11----------
of our mind that gives us the capacity


---------02:13----------
to self-reflect and is hyperactive when


---------02:15----------
we're depressed so when we're beating


---------02:17----------
ourselves up in depression oh i'm i'm


---------02:19----------
i'm stupid i'm dumb i'm this people


---------02:21----------
don't like me people would be better off


---------02:23----------
without me the everyone would have more


---------02:25----------
fun at the party if i wasn't there like


---------02:26----------
all these kinds of thoughts those are


---------02:28----------
not coming from the linguistic cortex


---------02:30----------
right those are coming from your default


---------02:31----------
mode network


---------02:33----------
we have a limbic system we have frontal


---------02:34----------
lobes we have all these different


---------02:35----------
cortices that will manage things like


---------02:38----------
risk assessment and anxiety and


---------02:40----------
mathematics we have all these different


---------02:42----------
parts of our brain that think


---------02:44----------
we also have empathic circuits of the


---------02:46----------
brain right which are like help us


---------02:48----------
understand other people none of those


---------02:50----------
things are the linguistic cortex


---------02:52----------
so the first thing to understand


---------02:55----------
is that when we have thoughts they exist


---------02:57----------
in all these different parts of our


---------02:58----------
brain


---------03:00----------
and when we speak


---------03:02----------
all that crap has to get channeled


---------03:04----------
through the linguistic cortex


---------03:07----------
and by channeling it through the


---------03:08----------
linguistic cortex we talk


---------03:11----------
and so the first thing to understand is


---------03:13----------
that like as long as that process


---------03:16----------
can be improved then you will be a


---------03:18----------
better communicator okay


---------03:19----------
so to start with


---------03:21----------
let's understand this


---------03:26----------
so


---------03:27----------
why can't the thoughts in my head


---------03:29----------
translate to the words that come out of


---------03:31----------
my mouth


---------03:32----------
and the short answer is because


---------03:33----------
communication


---------03:42----------
is a skill


---------03:46----------
so you know there are all kinds of other


---------03:48----------
things i can do in my head besides think


---------03:51----------
right


---------03:52----------
so i was like in the shower this morning


---------03:54----------
and i was you know washing my hair and


---------03:56----------
whatnot and washing my face and i


---------03:58----------
imagined doing a ninja kick i don't even


---------04:00----------
know what that is right so i'm just


---------04:02----------
making this up but like i imagine like


---------04:04----------
jumping over the fence and like doing


---------04:05----------
all this parkour and it would be so cool


---------04:07----------
if i could like jump and like i'm gonna


---------04:08----------
be like star wars kid and darth maul and


---------04:11----------
all this good stuff


---------04:13----------
right and i can imagine those things but


---------04:16----------
why can't my body do those things


---------04:19----------
i can imagine it


---------04:21----------
and so why do we assume that


---------04:23----------
communication is different why do we


---------04:25----------
assume that just because we can think


---------04:26----------
one thing i can think in ninja moves or


---------04:29----------
matrix martial arts sequences but that


---------04:31----------
doesn't mean my body can do them why do


---------04:33----------
we assume for a moment that just because


---------04:35----------
i can think articulately that speaking


---------04:38----------
articulately should come automatically


---------04:40----------
right so it comes down to the fact that


---------04:42----------
communication is a skill


---------04:44----------
so what are the components of


---------04:45----------
communication so the first that we kind


---------04:47----------
of talked about is the linguistic cortex


---------04:51----------
so if you want to be an effective


---------04:52----------
speaker


---------04:53----------
you have to like


---------04:56----------
work on the neurons that translate


---------05:01----------
thoughts


---------05:03----------
into words


---------05:06----------
and we know that people do this right so


---------05:08----------
like we know for example like


---------05:10----------
if you're an author


---------05:13----------
or let's say like you do creative


---------05:15----------
writing


---------05:18----------
so i'm just gonna use writing as an


---------05:19----------
example where you can have a scene in


---------05:20----------
your head you can even have the words in


---------05:23----------
your head he walked into the room


---------05:25----------
and he was


---------05:27----------
you know


---------05:28----------
covered in


---------05:29----------
sweat


---------05:31----------
like you can like think that and then


---------05:32----------
you write it out and it's like that


---------05:34----------
doesn't convey what i want


---------05:36----------
right so like getting stuff through the


---------05:38----------
linguistic cortex takes practice


---------05:41----------
so then people may wonder a little bit


---------05:42----------
about


---------05:45----------
um


---------05:46----------
you know so


---------05:47----------
what are some of the ways in which you


---------05:48----------
can do this so the first thing that you


---------05:49----------
can do is you can write stuff out


---------05:52----------
i don't know if you guys just noticed


---------05:55----------
but


---------05:55----------
what did i just look at


---------05:57----------
did y'all notice what was i looking at


---------06:01----------
i did this i was like what was i looking


---------06:03----------
at what do y'all think


---------06:04----------
right so i've written things out


---------06:09----------
and so as i write things out it


---------06:11----------
clarifies things in my mind and


---------06:13----------
facilitates the process of getting the


---------06:15----------
thoughts in my head out the linguistic


---------06:18----------
cortex and like through my mouth


---------06:20----------
so it's interesting right so you can


---------06:22----------
write things out so i've also i sort of


---------06:24----------
also recently discovered or like not


---------06:26----------
recently but somewhat you know maybe a


---------06:27----------
year or two ago the part of the reason


---------06:29----------
i'm successful on stream is that i spent


---------06:32----------
about 10 years like trying to write a


---------06:34----------
book and it was crap so like the book


---------06:36----------
sucked but what happened during those 10


---------06:39----------
years is i clarified a lot of my ideas


---------06:42----------
so when you write stuff out you know you


---------06:43----------
can go through the process of clarifying


---------06:45----------
ideas


---------06:48----------
and so the clarification of ideas can be


---------06:50----------
done through writing stuff out but i


---------06:52----------
also do this in terms of like verbal


---------06:54----------
communication without writing things out


---------06:56----------
so let's say i've got a patient with


---------06:57----------
narcissistic parents and the holidays


---------06:59----------
are coming up so when they come into my


---------07:01----------
office and they're saying i'm anxious


---------07:02----------
about the holidays i don't want to see


---------07:04----------
my parents i know they're going to fight


---------07:05----------
about this or they don't have to be


---------07:06----------
narcissistic they can be like


---------07:08----------
irregular people but they're just going


---------07:10----------
to ask me when am i going to get married


---------07:11----------
and like i don't want to have that


---------07:12----------
conversation


---------07:13----------
and so there's a lot of stuff that they


---------07:15----------
can tell me


---------07:17----------
in their office


---------07:19----------
right they can say to me like hey like i


---------07:21----------
i want to say this and i want to say


---------07:22----------
this and i want to say this but when it


---------07:24----------
comes to actually talking to them it's


---------07:26----------
hard so what do we do we role play right


---------07:28----------
we're like okay so like tell me what you


---------07:29----------
would want to say


---------07:31----------
and then i'll help them with their


---------07:32----------
phrasing and we'll kind of like coach


---------07:34----------
them through like okay why don't you say


---------07:35----------
this or you could say this i've had


---------07:37----------
conversations like this with like


---------07:38----------
patients of mine who want to talk to


---------07:40----------
their boss about


---------07:42----------
wanting more time off or like you know


---------07:44----------
breaking the news to their boss that


---------07:45----------
they're pregnant because they're


---------07:46----------
terrified of you know how it's going to


---------07:48----------
affect their promotion and things like


---------07:49----------
that forget the fact that it's illegal


---------07:51----------
but you know no one cares about that


---------07:54----------
so there's all kinds of like practice


---------07:56----------
you can literally do with your


---------07:57----------
linguistic cortex so this can be things


---------07:59----------
like role-playing conversations


---------08:02----------
and you can like role-play it in your


---------08:03----------
head if you want to but i think um


---------08:06----------
if you've got someone that you can talk


---------08:07----------
things through with


---------08:09----------
right so we also have these phrases like


---------08:11----------
sounding board


---------08:14----------
you can you can just practice


---------08:18----------
so that's like the first thing if you


---------08:19----------
want to be an effective communicator you


---------08:20----------
can practice


---------08:22----------
the second reason this is kind of big


---------08:25----------
that


---------08:26----------
communication everything makes perfect


---------08:28----------
sense in your head and doesn't translate


---------08:31----------
is because of assumptions


---------08:35----------
so


---------08:36----------
when you are thinking in your head


---------08:39----------
you have a bunch of assumptions


---------08:41----------
but you perfectly understand what your


---------08:44----------
assumptions are because they're your


---------08:46----------
assumptions so there's no gap between


---------08:48----------
like you know if i'm trying to say


---------08:50----------
one two three four


---------08:53----------
but i don't realize that my mind is


---------08:55----------
automatically filling in these gaps


---------08:59----------
right so then oh this is like perfect


---------09:01----------
it's a complete line fantastic


---------09:03----------
but when i start talking it comes out


---------09:05----------
jarbled


---------09:06----------
and what's missing it's the assumptions


---------09:11----------
so when you communicate it doesn't come


---------09:12----------
out the right way or people don't


---------09:14----------
understand it the right way so the other


---------09:16----------
thing to think a little bit about is if


---------09:18----------
we're saying how do i communicate


---------09:19----------
effectively


---------09:21----------
part of that effective communication


---------09:23----------
involves the other person right so how


---------09:25----------
do you deal with assumptions


---------09:27----------
so this is where it's kind of


---------09:28----------
interesting but this is where the


---------09:29----------
empathic circuits of your brain come in


---------09:38----------
so


---------09:39----------
even authors do this right because like


---------09:41----------
and when an author is writing something


---------09:44----------
they may know more of the story than


---------09:47----------
they want the reader to know but what


---------09:49----------
they literally have to do is put


---------09:51----------
themselves in the shoes of the reader


---------09:53----------
and look at things from the reader's


---------09:55----------
perspective


---------09:56----------
what are the things that are missing


---------09:57----------
from this story what do i need to


---------09:59----------
explain what are the things that i want


---------10:00----------
to purposely keep from the story because


---------10:03----------
every author who has sat down to write a


---------10:05----------
best-selling novel that had a plot to us


---------10:07----------
at the end they know the plot twist from


---------10:09----------
moment one


---------10:10----------
but it's their ability to empathize with


---------10:13----------
the reader that allows them to put in


---------10:15----------
the plot twist because for them it's not


---------10:17----------
a plot twist it's all figured out like


---------10:18----------
they know everything right at the


---------10:19----------
beginning right


---------10:20----------
so in a similar way if we want to


---------10:22----------
communicate with someone else what we


---------10:24----------
need to understand is what are our own


---------10:26----------
assumptions


---------10:27----------
and how can we have our audience


---------10:30----------
understand those assumptions and


---------10:31----------
oftentimes what's missing between our


---------10:34----------
head and the perfection of our head and


---------10:36----------
what is what we give to the rest of the


---------10:38----------
world what's missing is this stuff right


---------10:40----------
it's the in between stuff


---------10:43----------
so as we learn how to be more empathic


---------10:46----------
and we think a little bit about our


---------10:47----------
audience


---------10:49----------
we will start to be better at


---------10:50----------
communicating so i know this sounds kind


---------10:52----------
of weird but like i'm a psychiatrist


---------10:54----------
right so like what is my job


---------10:57----------
what have i trained myself to do what


---------10:59----------
i've trained myself to do is put myself


---------11:01----------
into someone else's shoes okay what's


---------11:03----------
going on in this person's head it's not


---------11:05----------
about who's right and who's wrong if i


---------11:07----------
tell this person hey your thinking is


---------11:09----------
wrong gg


---------11:10----------
this is what you should do just


---------11:12----------
get up every day like i wouldn't be


---------11:14----------
successful at all right


---------11:16----------
so being a successful psychiatrist being


---------11:18----------
a successful therapist being a good


---------11:19----------
friend


---------11:20----------
being a good parent


---------11:22----------
being a good kid


---------11:24----------
is about acknowledging your own


---------11:25----------
assumptions and meeting people where


---------11:27----------
they're at right so if i want to like if


---------11:30----------
i want to be an effective communicator


---------11:32----------
and i want to convey


---------11:34----------
you know this line i have to start by


---------11:36----------
understanding okay like where is my


---------11:38----------
audience what do they have and what do


---------11:39----------
they not have oh that's kind of


---------11:40----------
interesting so they already have this


---------11:42----------
part so actually what i need to to say


---------11:45----------
is this part


---------11:46----------
which is very different from what i was


---------11:48----------
envisioning because in my original


---------11:50----------
vision i only needed this


---------11:52----------
this


---------11:53----------
this and this


---------11:56----------
and so if you want to effectively


---------11:57----------
communicate instead of like operating


---------11:59----------
from your own mind and this is how we


---------12:01----------
get all these kinds of things like why


---------12:03----------
can't you understand i don't know how do


---------12:05----------
i get my kids to realize how do i get my


---------12:08----------
parents to realize that is you pulling


---------12:11----------
them towards this


---------12:13----------
instead of operating from here because


---------12:16----------
when you start communicating this way


---------12:17----------
you're like okay so they already get


---------12:18----------
this part so i'm going to provide this


---------12:20----------
and i'm going to provide this and then


---------12:21----------
we'll be golden so this is how you be an


---------12:23----------
effective communicator


---------12:25----------
so if you want your thoughts to


---------12:27----------
translate in a way that lands well


---------12:30----------
with other people


---------12:32----------
it involves your empathic circuits of


---------12:34----------
the brain


---------12:35----------
okay


---------12:36----------
so in short


---------12:38----------
we've got a couple of things to think


---------12:39----------
about so if your problem is


---------12:43----------
why can't i talk the way i do in my mind


---------12:45----------
the first thing that you've got to


---------12:46----------
understand is that


---------12:48----------
being able to convey the thoughts out of


---------12:50----------
your head is a skill


---------12:52----------
so it can be practice like i can imagine


---------12:54----------
all i can imagine a drawing


---------12:56----------
but i can't make a drawing i can imagine


---------12:59----------
doing gymnastics but i can't do


---------13:01----------
gymnastics there are all kinds of things


---------13:03----------
i can imagine in my mind and your


---------13:04----------
thoughts like you know communicating is


---------13:07----------
no different


---------13:09----------
and so this is a skill and what are the


---------13:11----------
components of the skill okay just to


---------13:13----------
kind of summarize


---------13:15----------
number one is training the linguistic


---------13:17----------
cortex


---------13:21----------
right so everything's got to come


---------13:22----------
through the linguistic cortex whether


---------13:23----------
you write or you speak


---------13:25----------
so this can involve things like writing


---------13:26----------
things out


---------13:31----------
right this can involve role playing


---------13:36----------
even rehearsal


---------13:40----------
right so these are examples of


---------13:41----------
essentially practice they're practicing


---------13:43----------
a skill the second thing is it comes


---------13:45----------
down to assumptions


---------13:49----------
so the biggest gaps in our thinking


---------13:51----------
are assumptions


---------13:53----------
so like we just don't realize what other


---------13:55----------
people are missing and if we want to be


---------13:56----------
effective communicators we need to


---------13:58----------
engage our empathic circuitry


---------14:02----------
understand what does someone else


---------14:04----------
understand we need to start there


---------14:06----------
because our communication is going to


---------14:08----------
depend on their understanding not our


---------14:10----------
understanding right to bridge the gap


---------14:12----------
between where they are and where you are


---------14:15----------
i'm trying to drag people over here


---------14:17----------
why don't you understand why don't you


---------14:19----------
understand why can't you understand why


---------14:20----------
can't you understand my boss doesn't


---------14:22----------
understand my girlfriend doesn't


---------14:23----------
understand my boyfriend doesn't


---------14:24----------
understand my dog doesn't understand


---------14:28----------
instead we need to go where they are


---------14:30----------
right and then we're going to go here


---------14:32----------
and then we're going to go here and then


---------14:33----------
we're going to go here and then we're


---------14:34----------
going to go here and then we're going to


---------14:35----------
go here then we're going to go here then


---------14:37----------
we're going to go here


---------14:38----------
this is how coaching works so we train


---------14:40----------
our coaches to meet their clients where


---------14:42----------
they're at so a client comes in and says


---------14:45----------
i need to


---------14:47----------
you know i need to get a job


---------14:49----------
and so the coach is like okay cool so


---------14:50----------
that's your goal for coaching right


---------14:52----------
they're like yeah my goal is to get a


---------14:53----------
job


---------14:54----------
and then over time like they may realize


---------14:55----------
that like okay so that's what the client


---------14:56----------
wants it's the fantasy that the client


---------14:58----------
wants but they have so much crap on


---------15:00----------
their plate they're not ready for a job


---------15:02----------
yet


---------15:03----------
every time they try to work on a resume


---------15:04----------
they deal with so much emotional


---------15:06----------
resistance and shame


---------15:08----------
they're like oh my god i'm so like they


---------15:10----------
try to put together that i have nothing


---------15:11----------
to put on my resume


---------15:13----------
and then they quit and they like go


---------15:14----------
distract themselves for a week


---------15:16----------
and so it's like the first thing coach


---------15:17----------
has to do is like work on their shame


---------15:19----------
but like if you tell the client hey you


---------15:20----------
need to like process your shame before


---------15:22----------
you get a job they're like no i need a


---------15:23----------
job


---------15:25----------
i need a job like that's my goal so you


---------15:28----------
have to like lead them there like one


---------15:29----------
step at a time right so you have to


---------15:31----------
start like you got to meet them where


---------15:32----------
they're at


---------15:33----------
if that makes sense


---------15:36----------
okay


---------15:39----------
so the last thing


---------15:41----------
that you can do


---------15:42----------
is calm the mind


---------15:47----------
okay


---------15:48----------
so this is where if we look at clinical


---------15:50----------
stuff so for example like let's look at


---------15:52----------
mania


---------15:54----------
so when someone has bipolar disorder and


---------15:56----------
they become manic


---------15:58----------
there's an alteration to the thought


---------16:00----------
process


---------16:04----------
and there's an increase of rapidity of


---------16:05----------
speech


---------16:08----------
as a result


---------16:10----------
manic people


---------16:12----------
make no sense


---------16:14----------
if you guys have ever like talked to a


---------16:15----------
manic person you kind of know what i'm


---------16:17----------
talking about but like their thoughts


---------16:19----------
are super super rapid


---------16:21----------
and they speak very very very rapidly


---------16:23----------
and they make no sense


---------16:25----------
i know everyone is joking about xqc but


---------16:27----------
xqc is not a good example of this xqc is


---------16:30----------
actually


---------16:31----------
very very effective at communicating


---------16:34----------
xqc can summarize things very very


---------16:36----------
easily


---------16:37----------
right like he'll drop


---------16:40----------
serious like knowledge bombs


---------16:42----------
seriously i'm not kidding


---------16:44----------
that's why if he was really nonsensical


---------16:47----------
and unable to communicate he would not


---------16:49----------
succeed on twitch


---------16:51----------
you guys get that


---------16:52----------
so i know everyone memes about that he's


---------16:54----------
definitely very vata for sure


---------16:56----------
and his thoughts kind of jump around all


---------16:58----------
over the place so so do i for that


---------16:59----------
matter


---------17:00----------
so in mania what we see is that you know


---------17:03----------
speeding up the thought process and the


---------17:04----------
rapidity of speech correlates with


---------17:06----------
making no sense to the other people so


---------17:08----------
what we can kind of infer is that


---------17:10----------
calming down yourself will probably lead


---------17:12----------
to better communication


---------17:14----------
so if i'm planning on giving a speech in


---------17:16----------
front of my class and i do some kind of


---------17:18----------
breathing exercises sometimes even as a


---------17:20----------
psychiatrist i'll prescribe something


---------17:21----------
like propranolol which is an adrenergic


---------17:24----------
blocker so reduces the effects of the


---------17:26----------
sympathetic nervous system and reduces


---------17:27----------
the effects of adrenaline and helps


---------17:29----------
people give a public speech what are we


---------17:31----------
doing propranolol is literally a drug


---------17:34----------
that slows down


---------17:36----------
the speed of your mind the speed of your


---------17:38----------
nervous system


---------17:39----------
and as a result people are able to


---------17:40----------
communicate more effectively


---------17:42----------
so calm the mind and slow things down is


---------17:45----------
the last thing so you can do breathing


---------17:46----------
exercises etc etc


---------17:49----------
so if you want to be able to communicate


---------17:51----------
effectively and you want the stuff in


---------17:52----------
here


---------17:53----------
to come out of your mouth in a way that


---------17:55----------
other people can understand do these


---------17:56----------
three things


---------17:59----------
practice with your linguistic cortex


---------18:01----------
focus on assumptions and think about


---------18:03----------
their point of view so that you can


---------18:04----------
structure your communication to be more


---------18:06----------
effective and calm down the mind and


---------18:08----------
slow down a little bit


---------18:13----------
questions


---------18:27----------
can you only do third sure


---------18:30----------
you don't have to do all three


---------18:32----------
but those are the three different


---------18:34----------
mechanisms that in my experience are at


---------18:36----------
play like there are probably many more


---------18:42----------
generally speaking when i face a problem


---------18:44----------
i find that


---------18:46----------
rather than going all in on one solution


---------18:48----------
that's sort of recognizing that problems


---------18:50----------
are multifactorial right so like the


---------18:52----------
inability to speak


---------18:54----------
coherently


---------18:55----------
isn't it's not like there's a coherent


---------18:57----------
speech circuit in your brain i mean this


---------18:58----------
sort of is the linguistic cortex but


---------19:00----------
there's all kinds of other things going


---------19:01----------
on right because your brain is inside


---------19:03----------
your body if your body is flooded with


---------19:05----------
adrenaline that's going to affect your


---------19:07----------
neurochemistry so it's not just as


---------19:09----------
simple as the linguistic cortex


---------19:11----------
speech in the translation of thought is


---------19:13----------
a complex phenomenon in the brain and


---------19:16----------
therefore


---------19:17----------
we it has a complex solution


---------19:29----------
do you think it's possible for people to


---------19:31----------
rationalize their thoughts


---------19:33----------
uh


---------19:34----------
they can't say through expression arts


---------19:36----------
music math problems sports freeform


---------19:38----------
games absolutely there's overwhelming


---------19:40----------
evidence that that is the case


---------19:42----------
so for example if you look at things


---------19:43----------
like art therapy


---------19:45----------
not only can you like


---------19:48----------
rationalize your thoughts you can even


---------19:49----------
heal the mind through some of these


---------19:52----------
things so we assume that therapy


---------19:54----------
involves one human being talking to


---------19:56----------
another human being but there are all


---------19:57----------
kinds of other things that you can do


---------19:59----------
through music through art that will like


---------20:02----------
emotionally process stuff so there's


---------20:04----------
strong strong evidence of that


---------20:13----------
yeah can you do the same type of


---------20:14----------
practicing for casual conversations as


---------20:16----------
well absolutely right so like casual


---------20:17----------
conversation is something you can


---------20:19----------
practice


---------20:21----------
like just about anything in life can be


---------20:23----------
practiced


---------20:35----------
you
