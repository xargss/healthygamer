---------00:00----------
let me share something with you if you


---------00:02----------
don't understand something in a


---------00:03----------
relationship


---------00:04----------
maybe try asking the other person


---------00:08----------
i have never tried that once ever and


---------00:11----------
therein lies i think a major


---------00:13----------
piece of social conditioning that you


---------00:15----------
probably never saw at home


---------00:22----------
there we go yeah of course man happy we


---------00:25----------
could help what's what's been going on


---------00:28----------
oh a lot um


---------00:32----------
i can honestly probably say the the past


---------00:34----------
three days have


---------00:36----------
most likely been the worst days of my


---------00:38----------
content creating


---------00:40----------
career i guess ever and uh it combined


---------00:44----------
with things from my personal life as


---------00:45----------
well stacking up at like inopportune


---------00:47----------
times it's been uh


---------00:48----------
it's been pretty damn rough and um


---------00:52----------
that's what seems to happen yeah and


---------00:54----------
then


---------00:56----------
yeah and then the worst thing that


---------00:57----------
happened is like this is the one time


---------00:59----------
where like i finally thought that like


---------01:01----------
okay i'm good like okay we're all good


---------01:04----------
this isn't gonna happen this time and


---------01:05----------
then


---------01:06----------
it happened it happened again even


---------01:09----------
though like i i tried


---------01:11----------
so hard to like like i thought i was


---------01:12----------
good i thought i was i was chill and


---------01:14----------
then all of a sudden


---------01:16----------
uh an unexpected conduit that caused


---------01:19----------
negative


---------01:20----------
emotions in mass happened again which


---------01:23----------
caused


---------01:24----------
situations that i wasn't for seeing


---------01:26----------
which is very unfortunate


---------01:29----------
uh yeah i'm losing you a little bit in


---------01:31----------
the abstractness so let's take a step


---------01:32----------
back


---------01:33----------
yeah sure yeah of course um so so okay


---------01:36----------
can that can you


---------01:37----------
start by just telling me what you go by


---------01:39----------
or what you want me to call you today


---------01:41----------
yeah i would love for you just to call


---------01:42----------
me john okay so


---------01:44----------
uh john so just so you know i i


---------01:46----------
understand


---------01:47----------
that our team was quite responsive to


---------01:49----------
you which is fantastic i'm really happy


---------01:51----------
to hear that they


---------01:52----------
you know um but i don't know anything


---------01:57----------
so like i have no idea and that's that's


---------02:00----------
actually how i


---------02:01----------
prefer to have it so i try not to be


---------02:03----------
like biased by like things that get


---------02:05----------
posted and anything like that


---------02:07----------
so i come into these completely blind


---------02:09----------
sometimes it's confusing for people


---------02:11----------
um especially the audience if they know


---------02:13----------
like if there's some kind of drama going


---------02:15----------
on but like i try to be blind to the


---------02:17----------
drama and like i don't pay attention to


---------02:18----------
it i stay off of


---------02:20----------
social media and stuff like that you


---------02:21----------
know i read reddit um just for fun


---------02:24----------
but yeah and i i really appreciate that


---------02:26----------
because i i need a non-biased


---------02:28----------
individual like yourself alok like so


---------02:30----------
badly because sure


---------02:33----------
it's it's hard to know like


---------02:38----------
sorry it's it's really hard to know


---------02:43----------
whether i'm the problem or not because


---------02:46----------
it keeps happening


---------02:47----------
and it's happened so many times


---------02:52----------
that i don't know when it's going to


---------02:53----------
stop


---------02:55----------
because it just keeps happening over and


---------02:57----------
over again and pretty much pretty much


---------02:58----------
what's happening


---------03:00----------
is that um i just keep pissing people


---------03:04----------
off and like i keep on hurting people


---------03:08----------
who i really care about and


---------03:13----------
i've pretty much lost every single


---------03:15----------
person that i've ever been close with uh


---------03:19----------
for longer than like two years besides


---------03:22----------
my best friend edric and my wife frame


---------03:26----------
okay i only really connect with one


---------03:28----------
member of my family anymore


---------03:30----------
i'm not gonna lie i've had a pretty


---------03:32----------
pretty bad experience with that


---------03:34----------
uh but it's just it's so hard to know


---------03:37----------
like


---------03:37----------
i mean you got to understand from and


---------03:39----------
i'm sure you do understand from my


---------03:40----------
perspective


---------03:41----------
is that i'm always the common


---------03:43----------
denominator


---------03:45----------
and so eventually i'm gonna assume well


---------03:48----------
it's probably me it's it was probably me


---------03:52----------
so it's just trying to determine that


---------03:54----------
okay which drugs


---------03:56----------
uh john can i just think for a second


---------04:00----------
of course yep of course so i'm trying to


---------04:03----------
figure out how to phrase this so


---------04:06----------
you know when you use phrases like i'm


---------04:08----------
the whether i'm the problem or i'm the


---------04:10----------
common denominator there can


---------04:13----------
it's a really tricky place to be because


---------04:15----------
there can be a lot of blame with that


---------04:17----------
right and the tricky thing here is that


---------04:20----------
if if you are responsible


---------04:24----------
then you actually have the power to


---------04:26----------
change it because it's like


---------04:27----------
in your wheelhouse does that make sense


---------04:29----------
right a hundred percent yes


---------04:31----------
the the challenge is that if you're not


---------04:34----------
responsible then you may not have the


---------04:36----------
power to change it so it's sort of like


---------04:37----------
a double-edged sword either way


---------04:39----------
so either you aren't quote-unquote the


---------04:42----------
problem


---------04:43----------
in which case you're just kind of like


---------04:45----------
unlucky and you may not be able to do


---------04:47----------
anything about it


---------04:48----------
because at the end of the day the only


---------04:49----------
thing you can control is yourself


---------04:51----------
right right and if you are quote-unquote


---------04:53----------
the problem


---------04:55----------
the challenge is that in my experience


---------04:56----------
that comes with a lot of blame


---------04:59----------
but it also comes with a lot of power


---------05:02----------
so what i i mean already i have no idea


---------05:04----------
what we're talking about but my first


---------05:06----------
thought here is like


---------05:07----------
what i want you to understand is that if


---------05:09----------
we're talking about interpersonal


---------05:10----------
relationships here


---------05:12----------
a lot of our our problems and


---------05:14----------
interpersonal relationships


---------05:16----------
do have we do have an element like we're


---------05:18----------
at least 50


---------05:19----------
right or at most 50 depending on how you


---------05:22----------
want to look at it and what i've seen in


---------05:24----------
people who


---------05:25----------
sus like continually have the same


---------05:27----------
problem in relationships


---------05:29----------
is that they do have some kind of


---------05:30----------
contribution but i know it sounds kind


---------05:32----------
of weird but that contribution may not


---------05:34----------
be


---------05:35----------
your fault even though it's your


---------05:37----------
contribution which i know sounds like


---------05:38----------
this this needs to be disentangled


---------05:40----------
but like so i'll just give you an


---------05:42----------
example you know if your parents


---------05:44----------
grew up in a particular way and there


---------05:47----------
was a certain like


---------05:48----------
husband-wife dynamic that you


---------05:51----------
internalized and


---------05:53----------
got socially conditioned to be


---------05:54----------
acceptable


---------05:56----------
and then like you take that programming


---------05:58----------
into all of your relationships and then


---------06:00----------
you wind up getting like


---------06:01----------
divorced twice in a sense you're


---------06:04----------
responsible for it but in a sense like


---------06:06----------
you didn't really know


---------06:07----------
better right yeah so i think it's like


---------06:09----------
it's important to be careful about like


---------06:11----------
responsibility and blame


---------06:13----------
and and already my sense i don't i don't


---------06:15----------
really know anything so this could be


---------06:16----------
like completely off base here


---------06:18----------
but my thought is how you know the goal


---------06:21----------
already i have a goal in my mind which


---------06:23----------
is to try to understand your


---------06:24----------
interpersonal dynamics


---------06:26----------
raise awareness as to what you do that


---------06:29----------
could impact those


---------06:30----------
and i know it sounds kind of weird but


---------06:32----------
we have to like really be careful about


---------06:33----------
non-judgment there


---------06:35----------
and then we have to understand like what


---------06:37----------
drives you to


---------06:38----------
engage in relationships the way that you


---------06:40----------
do


---------06:41----------
yes okay so it's not like does that sort


---------06:45----------
of make sense so it's gonna be like a


---------06:46----------
tricky tight rope to walk


---------06:48----------
uh to to sort of become aware of what


---------06:50----------
the problem is and like work on changing


---------06:52----------
it


---------06:53----------
without like self-flagellating yourself


---------06:55----------
and like thinking that you're a pos and


---------06:57----------
like things like that for like doing


---------06:58----------
that so far


---------06:59----------
like what's happened in the past has


---------07:01----------
happened in the past and you know we can


---------07:03----------
you can apologize for it you can try to


---------07:05----------
make up for it all those things are


---------07:06----------
healthy but at the same time


---------07:08----------
like self-blame doesn't really help very


---------07:11----------
much


---------07:12----------
um and so what i'm gonna what we may do


---------07:14----------
is like hold you


---------07:15----------
accountable and hold you responsible for


---------07:18----------
your actions


---------07:19----------
but we also want to do that like with


---------07:21----------
compassion


---------07:23----------
yes okay okay so tell me what are we


---------07:27----------
talking about john


---------07:29----------
uh we'll see i have this mentality where


---------07:32----------
i don't know if this is good or not


---------07:33----------
but like i i have been is it okay if i


---------07:36----------
cuss


---------07:36----------
yeah i think so okay i've been [ __ ]


---------07:40----------
so many goddamn times um by the people


---------07:42----------
who i've trusted the most like


---------07:44----------
i'm i'm underneath the mentality now


---------07:46----------
where like


---------07:47----------
i would rather like i i don't believe in


---------07:50----------
turning a new leaf for the majority of


---------07:51----------
people like everybody who's ever [ __ ]


---------07:53----------
me if i ever gave them another chance


---------07:55----------
they turned around and [ __ ] me again


---------07:57----------
uh so like for example like the reason


---------07:59----------
why me and my family don't have that


---------08:01----------
good of a relationship is because


---------08:02----------
uh i never knew when my parents were


---------08:05----------
together because they were divorced


---------08:06----------
before i was born


---------08:07----------
um and so my mom and dad they went their


---------08:10----------
separate ways


---------08:11----------
my mom had a new boyfriend every week


---------08:13----------
and my dad currently is on a seventh


---------08:15----------
divorce right now


---------08:16----------
so like i don't know yeah i don't know


---------08:20----------
what a good relationship looks like from


---------08:22----------
a family standpoint


---------08:23----------
um my sister when my house burned down


---------08:27----------
um my sister came out she my sister's


---------08:29----------
been in jail more times than she's been


---------08:30----------
out of jail


---------08:31----------
since she was like 14 so she went to


---------08:33----------
juby and all that stuff


---------08:34----------
so my house burnt down when both my


---------08:36----------
brothers were deployed and she was


---------08:37----------
supposed to take care of me but instead


---------08:39----------
what she did was


---------08:40----------
she came to my house took all of my


---------08:42----------
money that i had to survive until my dad


---------08:43----------
came out of prison


---------08:44----------
and then left me alone so then i had to


---------08:46----------
live and find somebody else to stay with


---------08:48----------
during that time period so i got [ __ ]


---------08:49----------
by her


---------08:50----------
and i already knew she was going to [ __ ]


---------08:51----------
him because of some other things that


---------08:52----------
happened in the past


---------08:53----------
uh my brother


---------08:56----------
ben is very very very aggro um and he


---------08:59----------
just scares the [ __ ] out of me and he's


---------09:00----------
made me lose a lot of friends so i i


---------09:02----------
don't think he was good for my life but


---------09:03----------
my brother mike is a massive inspiration


---------09:05----------
um he's he's one of the people who i


---------09:07----------
look up to most in life and uh


---------09:09----------
he was around me more than my dad when i


---------09:11----------
was a kid


---------09:12----------
so i used to call him dad because i


---------09:14----------
didn't actually uh


---------09:16----------
i that's what i thought so he's


---------09:20----------
he's like my rock like he's a person i


---------09:21----------
can always go back to


---------09:23----------
and then i have my uh my aunt and my


---------09:26----------
uncle bruce


---------09:28----------
who were like the first people in my


---------09:30----------
family to ever talk to me like i was an


---------09:32----------
adult and not just because i'm the


---------09:33----------
youngest in my family so everybody


---------09:34----------
talked to me like i was a kid


---------09:36----------
like i was a baby like i was wasting my


---------09:37----------
life but uh they were the first people


---------09:39----------
to ever talk to me like uh


---------09:41----------
i was like i was an actual adult like i


---------09:43----------
actually wasn't a complete absolute


---------09:44----------
idiot


---------09:45----------
because uh pretty much i was always told


---------09:48----------
everything that i did which was


---------09:49----------
i'm not gonna lie i was a kid the only


---------09:50----------
thing i enjoyed was playing world of


---------09:51----------
warcraft and league of legends


---------09:53----------
uh and so that's all i did i just played


---------09:54----------
video games and i always knew i wanted


---------09:56----------
to be a content creator and i always


---------09:57----------
knew it i always knew i could do it


---------09:59----------
um and uh that's all i did i was always


---------10:02----------
thought i was wasting my time and all


---------10:03----------
that jazz i was always trying to be


---------10:05----------
forced into sports


---------10:06----------
um but i don't give a [ __ ] about sports


---------10:08----------
i hate sports i think they're boring i'd


---------10:09----------
rather just watch anime about sports


---------10:10----------
because that's more


---------10:11----------
that's more interesting than me um


---------10:15----------
so i want to become a content creator so


---------10:16----------
i went to college for theater


---------10:18----------
um and i did professional theater for


---------10:20----------
about a year and a half and then after


---------10:22----------
that i did professional wrestling for


---------10:23----------
about two years


---------10:25----------
i got injured um and then i went back


---------10:28----------
into college to do


---------10:29----------
interactive media and 3d design i got a


---------10:31----------
course in video game theory that made me


---------10:33----------
do a video essay on banjo and kazooie


---------10:36----------
um and then i was like wow i just made


---------10:38----------
my first


---------10:39----------
youtube video and i was like why am i


---------10:42----------
not doing this all the time this is the


---------10:44----------
best thing ever


---------10:45----------
and so then i dropped out of college and


---------10:46----------
i've been doing that ever since and then


---------10:48----------
things have been going great ever since


---------10:51----------
uh so that's that's kind of where i'm at


---------10:54----------
with my family and then uh


---------10:57----------
my buddies i i guess


---------11:01----------
it's really hard to know


---------11:04----------
boundaries that have never been said


---------11:08----------
like so for example beautiful


---------11:11----------
yeah yeah like i don't know


---------11:14----------
how to not cross somebody's boundaries


---------11:17----------
if they never told me them


---------11:18----------
and the first time i lost my virginity


---------11:22----------
which was when i was 18


---------11:24----------
i didn't know that my buddy was in love


---------11:27----------
with the girl who i lost my virginity to


---------11:29----------
and so you'd think is we had like an


---------11:32----------
eight-year-long friendship


---------11:33----------
you'd think that we'd be good but


---------11:34----------
instead oh well you had sex with that


---------11:37----------
girl and i


---------11:37----------
didn't even enjoy it it sucked um well


---------11:40----------
you had sex with her so


---------11:42----------
now we're gone forever and that that was


---------11:44----------
the first time i was really ever heard


---------11:46----------
because i was like first of all i didn't


---------11:47----------
even want to do it


---------11:49----------
two it was her who came to me and i was


---------11:51----------
just like okay well now i can stop being


---------11:53----------
called a virgin and that'll be awesome


---------11:54----------
because good lord that [ __ ] haunted me


---------11:56----------
for so long


---------11:58----------
uh and so my other buddy


---------12:01----------
um his girlfriend told me that i was too


---------12:04----------
passive aggressive


---------12:05----------
get this i'm literally not even kidding


---------12:08----------
for some reason i'm called passive


---------12:10----------
aggressive


---------12:11----------
constantly like constantly and the


---------12:13----------
reason why i was called passive


---------12:14----------
aggressive


---------12:15----------
is because i used the the kitty face


---------12:18----------
emoji when i would talk to her because i


---------12:21----------
use that for everybody i


---------12:22----------
i think um emojis or emotes


---------12:25----------
are required to to fully encapsulate


---------12:29----------
human speech over text because if i send


---------12:32----------
you a message saying i'm fine period


---------12:34----------
you're gonna think that i'm pissed but


---------12:36----------
then if i said i'm fine


---------12:37----------
with like a happy face then you know oh


---------12:40----------
okay well you're actually fine like i


---------12:41----------
don't like


---------12:42----------
leaving room to let people intuit what


---------12:45----------
i'm saying


---------12:46----------
so i like using emojis in order to fill


---------12:48----------
that gap but then i was called


---------12:49----------
condescending and passive aggressive uh


---------12:51----------
and so


---------12:52----------
she said it's either me or him and then


---------12:55----------
he chose her


---------12:56----------
so i lost him as well uh another


---------12:59----------
eight-year-long friendship that is


---------13:01----------
pretty much


---------13:01----------
down the trend and it just keeps going


---------13:04----------
on like that where i just i just keep


---------13:06----------
losing people and i i keep on getting


---------13:08----------
called things that i don't understand


---------13:09----------
because


---------13:10----------
i'm a guy who does a lot of meditation i


---------13:12----------
do a lot of self-reflecting


---------13:14----------
and yet in my mind there's no way that


---------13:16----------
people could ever get to these uh i


---------13:18----------
guess conclusions that they're getting


---------13:19----------
to


---------13:20----------
yeah they seem to get to them regardless


---------13:22----------
and i don't know how to stop them


---------13:24----------
okay so just just to clarify a couple


---------13:27----------
things so it seems like multiple people


---------13:29----------
have told you that you are passive


---------13:30----------
aggressive


---------13:31----------
is that fair yes yes okay


---------13:34----------
um all right john i'm gonna need another


---------13:38----------
second to process is that cool


---------13:40----------
it gave me a lot love it i love it i'm


---------13:42----------
just gonna try to organize and try to


---------13:44----------
figure out how to help you okay


---------13:46----------
sure


---------13:49----------
okay so here's here's the general


---------13:51----------
direction i'm feeling like we should go


---------13:52----------
first


---------13:53----------
and that's i i love the way that you


---------13:54----------
said you know i don't know how to


---------13:56----------
respect boundaries that were not taught


---------13:59----------
to me


---------14:00----------
so i'm noticing you know that given your


---------14:03----------
home


---------14:04----------
situation there's a lot of like social


---------14:07----------
behavior


---------14:08----------
which we like internalize and are


---------14:10----------
conditioned to when we see healthy


---------14:12----------
relationships


---------14:13----------
so like you know if you think about like


---------14:15----------
how a child learns language


---------14:17----------
right like everyone around them is like


---------14:18----------
talking that language so they learn the


---------14:20----------
language and it feels supernatural to


---------14:22----------
them


---------14:23----------
so there's also a language of healthy


---------14:25----------
relationships


---------14:27----------
right so like our brain learns all kinds


---------14:29----------
of stuff we learn like mannerisms


---------14:32----------
right so my kids like sigh in the way


---------14:34----------
that i


---------14:35----------
sigh they'll be like


---------14:39----------
you know like like when when they like


---------14:41----------
when they don't get the card that they


---------14:42----------
wanted and go


---------14:43----------
fish they'll have like this subconscious


---------14:46----------
kind of like


---------14:47----------
behavioral response they also have ways


---------14:50----------
that they like relate to each other and


---------14:52----------
things like that so for example like


---------14:53----------
sometimes they come into the office


---------14:56----------
and like they're they know they're not


---------14:57----------
supposed to come into the office but


---------14:59----------
i'll say like hey do you remember you're


---------15:00----------
not supposed to come into the office


---------15:02----------
and then i'll i'll listen to why they


---------15:03----------
came in and then i'll like send them out


---------15:06----------
and so like if you think about it like


---------15:08----------
you know different parents may respond


---------15:10----------
to their kids in different ways like if


---------15:12----------
they violate the boundary


---------15:13----------
do they get punished do they get


---------15:15----------
reminded of the boundary do i like


---------15:17----------
you know evaluate them so i try to like


---------15:19----------
i try to evaluate them when they come in


---------15:21----------
and be like is this emergency because


---------15:23----------
i want them to come in if it's an


---------15:24----------
emergency and and so there's just a lot


---------15:27----------
of stuff that like hopefully my kids are


---------15:29----------
learning and i think they have because


---------15:30----------
they do this with other humans now too


---------15:32----------
where they like you know understand


---------15:34----------
boundaries a lot and they understand


---------15:35----------
like kids at the playground there's some


---------15:36----------
kids at the playground who don't respect


---------15:38----------
their boundaries


---------15:38----------
and some kids at the playground that do


---------15:40----------
respect their boundaries and in terms of


---------15:42----------
when a kid doesn't respect their


---------15:43----------
boundaries like what is the way that we


---------15:45----------
interact with that kid


---------15:47----------
and how do i talk to them so there's


---------15:48----------
like a lot of stuff that like


---------15:50----------
our human brain when we're like a


---------15:52----------
six-year-old is like a sponge and it


---------15:54----------
absorbs all kind of crap


---------15:56----------
and what i'm noticing just based on your


---------15:58----------
history is it sounds like the rules of


---------16:01----------
relationships


---------16:03----------
the rules of healthy relationships was


---------16:05----------
not something that your five-year-old


---------16:06----------
brain


---------16:07----------
knew how to like didn't get taught


---------16:11----------
and so then what happens is as you


---------16:13----------
become an adult and you engage in other


---------16:15----------
people who are like


---------16:16----------
conditioned or they were taught a set of


---------16:18----------
rules which like like you guys are


---------16:20----------
playing a game


---------16:21----------
where like 90 percent of the population


---------16:24----------
or let's say 80


---------16:24----------
of the population has a shared rule set


---------16:28----------
and then you're playing some weird ass


---------16:30----------
hardcore


---------16:31----------
you know iron man mod and so it changes


---------16:34----------
the way that you interact with them


---------16:37----------
and then like the the passive aggressive


---------16:40----------
is is a good


---------16:41----------
term for like when when you're doing


---------16:43----------
something that someone


---------16:44----------
doesn't like and they can't


---------16:48----------
point to a behavior what they call you


---------16:50----------
is passive aggressive


---------16:52----------
they feel like you're doing something


---------16:53----------
wrong but you're not actually breaking


---------16:55----------
any of the rules which is how you


---------16:56----------
learned it right like


---------16:57----------
you learned like very consciously like


---------16:59----------
these are the rules of how you behave


---------17:01----------
with people


---------17:02----------
case in point i mean you can think about


---------17:03----------
just the cognitive work that you've done


---------17:06----------
if i tell people it's like an if then


---------17:08----------
sip you're like a [ __ ] robot


---------17:10----------
if i say i'm fine period they will be


---------17:12----------
upset


---------17:13----------
if i type i'm fine period you're like an


---------17:15----------
ai trying to learn human interactions


---------17:18----------
and then i add this emoji then they


---------17:20----------
won't be upset


---------17:21----------
and so what's happening is you're


---------17:23----------
engaging with people where you're like


---------17:24----------
following all the rules as you've


---------17:26----------
learned them because you like had to


---------17:28----------
figure this [ __ ] out


---------17:29----------
very like cognitively it wasn't like


---------17:31----------
internalized it wasn't baked in


---------17:33----------
and then what happens is you're not


---------17:34----------
violating any of the rules


---------17:36----------
but something is robbing someone the


---------17:38----------
wrong way to where they're like


---------17:39----------
i can't point to anything wrong that


---------17:41----------
he's doing but i just don't like him


---------17:44----------
and then they call you passive


---------17:45----------
aggressive because there's no sin


---------17:48----------
right there's no mistake there's nothing


---------17:49----------
that they can actually call you out on


---------17:51----------
and that's that's why it's even more


---------17:52----------
confusing for you because then you're


---------17:54----------
like what the [ __ ]


---------17:55----------
am i doing wrong like if i'm making a


---------17:57----------
mistake i will try to correct it because


---------17:59----------
i care about these people and i care


---------18:00----------
about these relationships but they're


---------18:02----------
like you're passive aggressive and


---------18:03----------
you're like


---------18:03----------
i don't know how to be not that


---------18:08----------
you yes yes right exactly what you're


---------18:11----------
saying yes


---------18:12----------
i mean if i'm screwing up somewhere just


---------18:14----------
like tell me what i'm screwing up and i


---------18:16----------
want to apologize and i want to change


---------18:19----------
because this matters to me but they're


---------18:21----------
like you're passive aggressive and


---------18:22----------
there's no


---------18:22----------
it's like a dead end there's no solution


---------18:24----------
there yeah


---------18:27----------
so does that make sense that makes


---------18:30----------
a lot of sense yes i've actually i've


---------18:32----------
never thought of it like that way my


---------18:34----------
entire life


---------18:35----------
yeah so i think it's like you've learned


---------18:36----------
it's a really interesting pattern but


---------18:38----------
like


---------18:39----------
you weren't taught the rules of the game


---------18:40----------
intuitively so when you don't have the


---------18:43----------
intuitive knowledge like


---------18:44----------
you know i i don't know how to say this


---------18:45----------
but like i mean you played a bunch of


---------18:46----------
games right


---------18:47----------
so if you play like league of legends


---------18:49----------
like you know that there's


---------18:50----------
there's these abstract concepts like


---------18:54----------
map control and pressure like lane


---------18:57----------
pressure right like


---------18:58----------
and the problem is like if if you don't


---------19:01----------
you can't


---------19:01----------
teach someone lane pressure


---------19:04----------
they have to like understand it you know


---------19:07----------
like it's like a principle and so


---------19:09----------
what can happen is i can analyze a game


---------19:11----------
of league of legends


---------19:12----------
and i can sort of like come up with a


---------19:14----------
set of if then statements


---------19:15----------
if three players are pushing top then i


---------19:18----------
should go bottom


---------19:20----------
and then like like you know i can do as


---------19:22----------
many of those if then statements that i


---------19:23----------
want to


---------19:24----------
and it will sort of approximate lane


---------19:26----------
pressure but it'll never


---------19:28----------
truly be an understanding of lane


---------19:29----------
pressure and then what happens is


---------19:32----------
the number of if then statements you


---------19:33----------
have in your head


---------19:35----------
works for like a certain amount of time


---------19:37----------
but unless you understand the equation


---------19:39----------
underneath eventually you'll hit a


---------19:41----------
social situation


---------19:43----------
where you don't have an if then


---------19:44----------
statement for it and you'll lose because


---------19:45----------
you don't understand lane pressure


---------19:48----------
yeah and that's why it sounds like


---------19:50----------
you're able to maintain relationships


---------19:52----------
for a while


---------19:53----------
but it sounds like eventually you hit


---------19:55----------
some scenario where like


---------19:56----------
you don't know the equation and you're


---------19:58----------
like if then statements don't match it


---------20:00----------
and then you kind of screw up in some


---------20:02----------
way yeah like i


---------20:04----------
i had this situation with my buddy and


---------20:06----------
we were


---------20:07----------
so close for like nine months like so


---------20:11----------
close


---------20:12----------
and then literally out of nowhere


---------20:15----------
this guy pulls me aside in the discord


---------20:17----------
call and says


---------20:19----------
hey you know all of your friends


---------20:20----------
actually hate you right


---------20:22----------
and they're completely fake to you and


---------20:24----------
the moment that you're not in the call


---------20:26----------
like they're all just [ __ ] on you


---------20:27----------
constantly


---------20:29----------
and it was just completely out of the


---------20:31----------
blue and like my wife was in those calls


---------20:33----------
and like obviously


---------20:35----------
you know she wouldn't lie to me because


---------20:36----------
we've been together for about 10 years


---------20:38----------
and it's just sometimes i have this


---------20:40----------
experience where i don't know if i'm


---------20:42----------
just not observant


---------20:43----------
but it almost feels like some of the


---------20:45----------
people who are the closest to me


---------20:46----------
have like this flip where they just say


---------20:50----------
like these ridiculously


---------20:52----------
rude things to me out of nowhere that


---------20:54----------
are completely unbased


---------20:56----------
and just try to destroy me it's


---------20:59----------
very strange and i i don't i don't know


---------21:02----------
what to do about that because i don't


---------21:03----------
know if i'm just


---------21:05----------
not perceptive enough or i don't even


---------21:07----------
know what their motive is


---------21:10----------
well so okay so let's let's bump


---------21:13----------
i've a couple of thoughts there but i


---------21:15----------
think probably what i need to do


---------21:17----------
is i'm sort of flying blind here like


---------21:19----------
i'm taking hail mary shots here


---------21:20----------
it seems like they're hitting so far but


---------21:22----------
i want to take a step back because i


---------21:24----------
have a lot of thoughts about you know


---------21:25----------
what you can do


---------21:26----------
to you know transform your social


---------21:29----------
interactions


---------21:30----------
but before we get there i want to just


---------21:31----------
make sure that i understand your


---------21:33----------
situation so


---------21:34----------
can you just like tell me more john like


---------21:36----------
what's been happening to you recently


---------21:38----------
like what's been going on like


---------21:39----------
help me understand like what your


---------21:41----------
experience of things is


---------21:43----------
sure uh when you say with things do you


---------21:45----------
mean with my friends or like what's


---------21:46----------
happening with the content grading side


---------21:48----------
or just


---------21:48----------
whatever whatever you want to talk about


---------21:50----------
like whatever you want whatever you wish


---------21:52----------
was different just tell me about it


---------21:54----------
all right so the thing that i'm having


---------21:55----------
an issue is with content creating is


---------21:58----------
is that i have been called dramatic


---------22:01----------
like i cause drama and


---------22:04----------
in my perspective and maybe you disagree


---------22:07----------
like


---------22:07----------
if somebody says literally


---------22:11----------
fake things about me and they have a if


---------22:14----------
it's a small


---------22:14----------
channel it's easy to ignore but if it's


---------22:16----------
a big channel saying that


---------22:18----------
i did this this and this if i respond to


---------22:22----------
them and tell them why they're wrong


---------22:25----------
and prove why because i'd like he said


---------22:28----------
she said scenarios are toxic i try not


---------22:30----------
to get involved in those


---------22:31----------
but if i have literal hard proof of that


---------22:35----------
no i didn't do any of that look at this


---------22:39----------
and then like i don't get how that's me


---------22:42----------
being dramatic that's me just i don't


---------22:43----------
get the difference between causing drama


---------22:45----------
and just trying to clear my name like


---------22:48----------
another another big example of that is


---------22:50----------
five months ago no joke i got cancelled


---------22:52----------
on twitter and they took


---------22:54----------
all of these clips from me out of


---------22:56----------
context


---------22:57----------
and i was called


---------23:01----------
transphobic homophobic and a pedophile


---------23:05----------
okay and my little sister and my niece


---------23:07----------
saw that


---------23:08----------
and the reason why i was called a


---------23:10----------
pedophile was because i was making this


---------23:12----------
thing called a waifu tier list


---------23:15----------
where there's this character in this


---------23:16----------
game i called her name's clay


---------23:18----------
she's 12 years old and this statement i


---------23:21----------
said was


---------23:22----------
was that glee could be a waifu for


---------23:24----------
another 12 year old


---------23:26----------
so i wanted the ranker at a b tier


---------23:28----------
because i think in a middle school


---------23:30----------
setting i think they would be cute to be


---------23:32----------
boyfriend and girlfriend


---------23:34----------
but instead what people took from that


---------23:36----------
was oh techtone likes to [ __ ]


---------23:38----------
kids this retweet thing got over


---------23:42----------
20 000 retweets and i disproved


---------23:46----------
every single claim and showed those


---------23:48----------
clips in full context but the problem is


---------23:51----------
is the person who made the post admitted


---------23:53----------
that they were trying to paint me in a


---------23:54----------
bad light


---------23:55----------
they admitted that they hated me and


---------23:56----------
they wanted to cause me [ __ ] but they


---------23:58----------
felt bad because


---------23:59----------
apparently someone from my community


---------24:01----------
went and tried to dox them


---------24:03----------
and i told them don't [ __ ] do that


---------24:05----------
what are you doing this person's just


---------24:06----------
confused


---------24:07----------
i go to their channel i reach out i try


---------24:09----------
to check in on them and they said wow i


---------24:10----------
would have never expected this behavior


---------24:11----------
from you


---------24:12----------
admitted the entire thing that was a lie


---------24:14----------
and took the entire post down


---------24:16----------
but the problem is is that with me in


---------24:18----------
particular maybe it happens to everybody


---------24:20----------
everybody's there when somebody calls


---------24:23----------
you a [ __ ]


---------24:24----------
but nobody was there when they admitted


---------24:26----------
oh hey


---------24:27----------
that was a lie so now so many people


---------24:30----------
have this impression of me from an


---------24:31----------
article that got


---------24:32----------
so much traction that was completely


---------24:34----------
unbased completely inaccurate


---------24:36----------
and nobody saw the apology because the


---------24:38----------
post itself got twenty thousand retweets


---------24:40----------
the apology got about seven hearts so


---------24:46----------
it just sucks because like i i don't get


---------24:49----------
why like


---------24:50----------
things that are hateful about me get so


---------24:51----------
much traction but anything that's good


---------24:54----------
gets like nothing and there are even


---------24:56----------
people who like say


---------24:57----------
if you support techtone you can go [ __ ]


---------24:59----------
yourself unfollow me like i just don't


---------25:01----------
get it like i don't get that [ __ ] at all


---------25:04----------
okay


---------25:11----------
why do you think they target you


---------25:23----------
i have a lot of i have a lot of i have a


---------25:25----------
lot of reasons


---------25:27----------
um one is that when i do stream because


---------25:30----------
i was taught this in professional


---------25:31----------
wrestling in theater


---------25:32----------
the most authentic acting is when you


---------25:34----------
take yourself and you turn it up to 11.


---------25:37----------
so i like to portray myself as like this


---------25:40----------
super light happy loud fun guy


---------25:43----------
when in reality i'm actually quite


---------25:45----------
depressed but i like doing that because


---------25:48----------
i feel that positivity spreads


---------25:50----------
and if i come on streaming because i'm


---------25:52----------
not so two days ago was the first time i


---------25:54----------
ever actually cried on stream because


---------25:55----------
generally when i feel sad i just turn


---------25:56----------
off the camera and i just i just go away


---------25:58----------
i have a panic attack and i have tons of


---------26:00----------
anxiety but i uh i recently started this


---------26:02----------
stuff called ashwagandha which has been


---------26:04----------
great it's been


---------26:05----------
changed my life to be honest and uh


---------26:08----------
i don't really have that many panic


---------26:10----------
attacks anymore but i have anxiety


---------26:11----------
non-stop i mean the reason why i think


---------26:13----------
people [ __ ] on me is probably because


---------26:16----------
i i definitely give a reaction when when


---------26:19----------
somebody


---------26:20----------
you know says some [ __ ] about me i


---------26:21----------
can't ignore it i have to say it if it


---------26:23----------
has you know


---------26:24----------
at least if too many people see it i


---------26:27----------
have to give a statement


---------26:29----------
so i do think maybe i respond too much


---------26:31----------
and uh


---------26:33----------
i guess i'm just in in in my demographic


---------26:37----------
which is like gotcha games i feel like


---------26:40----------
i'm i'm


---------26:40----------
extremely outspoken and incredibly loud


---------26:44----------
uh and i also don't think people know


---------26:46----------
the difference between my persona


---------26:48----------
techtone and then who i actually am


---------26:49----------
which is just john


---------26:52----------
it's my theory okay


---------27:04----------
okay


---------27:06----------
okay john i think there's i'm gonna


---------27:09----------
so there's this is a whole different can


---------27:12----------
it's not a different can of worms


---------27:14----------
there's a whole separate can of worms


---------27:16----------
that is also


---------27:17----------
involved here which has to do with like


---------27:19----------
what we've learned at hg about content


---------27:22----------
creators


---------27:23----------
and the first thing to understand is


---------27:25----------
like you get you're gonna get a


---------27:26----------
disproportionate amount of hate


---------27:28----------
because of the way that


---------27:31----------
content creation works so for example


---------27:34----------
like


---------27:35----------
you know i don't know how much of this


---------27:36----------
is personally you and how much of it is


---------27:38----------
just like


---------27:39----------
there's almost like a behavioral


---------27:41----------
reinforcement where like if i know that


---------27:43----------
i'm gonna get an 11 out of 10 response


---------27:48----------
if i crap on techtone then what i'm


---------27:51----------
going to do is crap on techtone because


---------27:54----------
he's going to respond and then like it's


---------27:56----------
going to become a thing


---------27:58----------
right and and then like there's also


---------28:00----------
there's like a whole there's a whole


---------28:02----------
i mean it gets complicated because then


---------28:03----------
people feel like self-righteous because


---------28:05----------
now if they think that you're a


---------28:06----------
pedophile they'll go out of their way to


---------28:08----------
expose you because they think that


---------28:10----------
they're doing the world


---------28:11----------
like good and then if you respond to


---------28:13----------
that like you know it just


---------28:15----------
every response feeds the flames and so


---------28:18----------
it's strange but there's almost like a


---------28:20----------
behavioral reinforcement to


---------28:22----------
even responding to drama you're actually


---------28:25----------
like


---------28:26----------
reinforcing the drama because there are


---------28:28----------
these other things like there's like


---------28:29----------
this darwinian effect where


---------28:31----------
you know the hate post gets 20 000


---------28:33----------
whatever


---------28:34----------
and then the apology post gets seven


---------28:36----------
whatever which means that what's


---------28:38----------
happening is the internet from a


---------28:40----------
darwinian fashion


---------28:42----------
is actually like selecting for hateful


---------28:44----------
content


---------28:45----------
so like that that it's just a function


---------28:47----------
of like the way that our our like


---------28:50----------
propagation algorithms and human


---------28:51----------
psychology work


---------28:54----------
does that make sense yeah it does yes


---------28:57----------
so so i think the the other thing though


---------28:59----------
is that i i think that where this could


---------29:00----------
overlap is i'm curious


---------29:02----------
why like someone would go out of their


---------29:04----------
way to take


---------29:06----------
a bunch of your clips and put them out


---------29:08----------
of context to try to like smear you


---------29:10----------
so there may be something there that you


---------29:12----------
are actually doing that like puts a


---------29:14----------
target on your back in the first place


---------29:17----------
i 100 agree i just have no idea what


---------29:20----------
that is


---------29:21----------
so this is where the overlap may be go


---------29:23----------
ahead do you have ideas


---------29:26----------
um you sounded like you're about to say


---------29:29----------
something and i cut you off no yeah no


---------29:30----------
because that's that's what it's always


---------29:31----------
been like it's just like


---------29:33----------
there there has to be a reason


---------29:36----------
and it sucks because i i don't do


---------29:40----------
anything necessarily that other


---------29:42----------
streamers


---------29:44----------
don't do like i pretty much


---------29:48----------
i don't know i mean to be all uh


---------29:52----------
no i don't i mean no i i don't really


---------29:55----------
know


---------29:56----------
okay i wish i i've been trying to


---------29:57----------
because like i i'm at like


---------29:59----------
it can sometimes feel like my brain is


---------30:01----------
exploding because like


---------30:02----------
i'll just think and i'll think and i'll


---------30:04----------
think and i'll think and like i haven't


---------30:05----------
got that much sleep in the past three


---------30:06----------
days i'm not gonna lie


---------30:08----------
um because even now like i don't even


---------30:11----------
know


---------30:12----------
i'm just trying to process and figure


---------30:14----------
out how do i get this to never happen


---------30:17----------
again


---------30:17----------
like how do i how do i stop this


---------30:21----------
yes i i don't know that you can stop it


---------30:25----------
but i think


---------30:26----------
my you know what i would try to help you


---------30:28----------
do is not stop it but ra


---------30:30----------
rather reduce it and and be able to like


---------30:32----------
process it


---------30:34----------
right because as long as you're a


---------30:35----------
content creator like people are gonna


---------30:36----------
[ __ ] on you like it's just


---------30:38----------
it's part of the business yeah and and


---------30:41----------
so


---------30:42----------
so maybe let's go a little bit more


---------30:43----------
personal and see if there are particular


---------30:45----------
aspects of your behavior or your


---------30:47----------
personality that like


---------30:49----------
translate on the stream that are causing


---------30:51----------
because if you have problems on stream


---------30:52----------
and you have problems in your personal


---------30:54----------
relationships


---------30:55----------
there's usually a common element there


---------30:56----------
so like maybe the way that we can try to


---------30:59----------
elucidate those because there probably


---------31:00----------
is some there's some problem right


---------31:02----------
because you're not like a dumb guy and


---------31:03----------
if you're saying


---------31:04----------
like hey this pattern keeps happening


---------31:06----------
like you are the common denominator so


---------31:07----------
that should be like explored


---------31:09----------
so can you give me an example so that's


---------31:11----------
really helpful from like a professional


---------31:12----------
standpoint that it seems like you do


---------31:14----------
something


---------31:14----------
people you get you have a target on your


---------31:16----------
back you kind of work like you know then


---------31:18----------
they smear you and then you defend


---------31:19----------
yourself and it's


---------31:20----------
absolutely frustrating that you know the


---------31:22----------
smear post gets 20 000 whatever and then


---------31:24----------
like


---------31:25----------
the apology post i've seen the same


---------31:26----------
thing in terms of accusations of sexual


---------31:28----------
assault and stuff like that with people


---------31:30----------
who are innocent it's actually really


---------31:31----------
tragic


---------31:32----------
that you know the accusation gets like


---------31:34----------
spread like wildfire and it's like


---------31:36----------
guilty until proven innocent


---------31:38----------
and then like when someone comes out


---------31:40----------
with uh


---------31:41----------
um you know with an apology or even like


---------31:43----------
rescinds it there's like


---------31:45----------
nothing it's like crickets


---------31:48----------
and and i've seen this a lot with a lot


---------31:50----------
of the the men in my practice where


---------31:52----------
there's almost like


---------31:53----------
a trauma from being accused of sexual


---------31:57----------
assault especially


---------31:59----------
and i'm i'm not saying that you know


---------32:02----------
it just gets tricky but sometimes you


---------32:04----------
know people are innocent


---------32:06----------
and and but their life gets ruined yeah


---------32:09----------
um so you know i think there's gonna be


---------32:12----------
like there's definitely like just this


---------32:13----------
aspect in human society where like


---------32:15----------
accusations


---------32:17----------
um spread farther than like


---------32:20----------
vindications um and


---------32:24----------
and i don't really know what to do about


---------32:25----------
that so let's like kind of focus a


---------32:27----------
little bit more on


---------32:29----------
um you know your personal relationship


---------32:32----------
so can you tell me


---------32:33----------
like just pick something that's been


---------32:35----------
happening recently with you and and what


---------32:37----------
your understanding of it is


---------32:39----------
sure well i would like to say the


---------32:40----------
majority of friends that i have lost is


---------32:42----------
mainly just because i've moved around a


---------32:43----------
lot


---------32:44----------
like and they don't play video games so


---------32:46----------
like i don't know how to talk to people


---------32:48----------
unless we're playing a video game


---------32:49----------
together okay so that's that's the


---------32:51----------
majority of them


---------32:53----------
it's just i move don't know how to


---------32:54----------
connect with regular conversation


---------32:56----------
we don't play the same games or they


---------32:58----------
don't play games so i don't know


---------33:00----------
like first like with my brother who's


---------33:01----------
like one of the guys i'm close with ever


---------33:03----------
he doesn't play video games either so we


---------33:04----------
just talk like once a year but when we


---------33:06----------
talk it's like


---------33:07----------
like nothing ever changed like we're


---------33:08----------
right there


---------33:10----------
um with with other issues i i guess


---------33:15----------
i have had a lot of friends who have not


---------33:17----------
wanted to


---------33:18----------
be my friend because


---------33:22----------
oh god uh it feels


---------33:26----------
i guess maybe i'd


---------33:29----------
i say too much like and i i think i give


---------33:32----------
my opinion a little bit too quick


---------33:35----------
what do you mean like that so like


---------33:40----------
i'm pretty aware when somebody is like


---------33:42----------
like when a girl is trying to get with a


---------33:44----------
guy


---------33:44----------
and i know i know oh god i know when


---------33:48----------
somebody's


---------33:48----------
i think i know when somebody's a piece


---------33:50----------
of [ __ ]


---------33:52----------
but like for example like when i see one


---------33:54----------
of my buddies


---------33:55----------
with a girl who i know is not good for


---------33:58----------
him because like


---------34:00----------
i don't know how to i don't know how to


---------34:01----------
tell my buddy to to leave a [ __ ] girl


---------34:04----------
when they've cheated on them twice so


---------34:07----------
i'm like


---------34:08----------
okay like they may want to deal with it


---------34:10----------
but i'm just like it's just gonna happen


---------34:12----------
again


---------34:13----------
like they [ __ ] another dude when you


---------34:15----------
were gone


---------34:17----------
why would you forgive that and like i


---------34:20----------
guess i'm


---------34:20----------
i'm too i'm too abrasive


---------34:24----------
because when i see things so black and


---------34:26----------
white and like when i see somebody


---------34:27----------
that's [ __ ] up when i see somebody


---------34:29----------
hurt one of my friends i have to say


---------34:31----------
something


---------34:32----------
and and maybe maybe i don't give them


---------34:34----------
their time to deal with things naturally


---------34:36----------
but i'm just like girl cheats


---------34:39----------
on boy boy should leave girl


---------34:42----------
because if not boy gets hurt again


---------34:46----------
and so like i don't know how yes i go


---------34:48----------
ahead


---------34:49----------
why do you have to say something because


---------34:52----------
i don't


---------34:52----------
i don't i don't want to see my friends


---------34:54----------
get hurt again


---------34:56----------
like if i know it's going to happen


---------34:58----------
again and it'll happen again


---------35:01----------
i don't know how to not say yo man you


---------35:04----------
should be careful and i'm never abrasive


---------35:05----------
about i'm just like do you really want


---------35:07----------
to go through with this again


---------35:08----------
like i i don't i hate like i can't stand


---------35:13----------
i can't stand seeing my friends get hurt


---------35:16----------
and so


---------35:16----------
when i try to sorry go ahead what makes


---------35:19----------
that hard for you


---------35:23----------
i think i actually know the point i


---------35:26----------
think i know why it's been so hard


---------35:30----------
because i once again i i try to figure


---------35:31----------
out why do i think this way


---------35:33----------
why is it so important to me and so i


---------35:36----------
backtracked way back


---------35:38----------
way back and this was like first second


---------35:40----------
grade uh


---------35:42----------
and my mom had a really a really rough


---------35:44----------
life uh because she had to take care of


---------35:45----------
four kids by herself


---------35:47----------
uh because my dad wasn't in the picture


---------35:48----------
early on


---------35:50----------
so my mom was so stressed all the time


---------35:52----------
so she would get angry


---------35:54----------
and she would just unleash havoc on my


---------35:56----------
two brothers and i loved them more than


---------35:58----------
anything


---------35:59----------
uh to where my my brother mike would


---------36:01----------
call me the sacrificial lamb of the


---------36:03----------
family


---------36:04----------
because when i would see my mother


---------36:06----------
yelling at my brothers


---------36:08----------
i would do something intentionally


---------36:11----------
horrible


---------36:12----------
that way i could shift her being angry


---------36:16----------
at them


---------36:16----------
to her being angry at me because then i


---------36:19----------
also know that i can get her to


---------36:21----------
accept what i did because i can actually


---------36:23----------
give a heartfelt apology because when i


---------36:26----------
[ __ ] up and i'm going into that with the


---------36:27----------
mindset of okay i'm going to [ __ ] up


---------36:29----------
tremendously


---------36:30----------
i know how to apologize and mean it


---------36:32----------
because i i didn't know my action was


---------36:34----------
wrong but like


---------36:36----------
i i just i can't i ca it just came back


---------36:39----------
from that


---------36:40----------
it's just when i see other people in


---------36:42----------
pain it's easier for myself to be in


---------36:44----------
pain than see them in pain because this


---------36:46----------
way i can make that go away for them


---------36:48----------
and just kind of take that on myself


---------36:50----------
which i understand is incredibly


---------36:51----------
unhealthy


---------36:52----------
but unhealthy in what way unhealthy for


---------36:55----------
me


---------36:56----------
but good for them because on one hand


---------36:59----------
that's just gonna continue


---------37:01----------
to you know i guess send people the


---------37:03----------
wrong message of who i am because i'm


---------37:05----------
doing things that i wouldn't naturally


---------37:06----------
do


---------37:07----------
so that way i can get people to [ __ ] off


---------37:08----------
the other people but then


---------37:10----------
on the other hand that i don't have to


---------37:12----------
see my brothers or my friends


---------37:14----------
get [ __ ] so john i'm gonna ask you


---------37:17----------
some weird questions okay


---------37:19----------
anything i'm an open book so when you


---------37:21----------
say when you say


---------37:22----------
i can't stand seeing my friends hurt


---------37:26----------
so i have to say something whose


---------37:28----------
feelings are you prioritizing in that


---------37:31----------
interaction


---------37:33----------
i'm trying to prioritize theirs really


---------37:36----------
think about that for a second


---------37:40----------
so what is the emotional driver that is


---------37:42----------
prompting you to action


---------37:45----------
me not wanting to see them hurt


---------37:48----------
so that's that's that's my thing that


---------37:50----------
isn't my thing that is oh absolutely


---------37:53----------
yeah that is i never thought about that


---------37:54----------
way


---------37:56----------
so like here's the crazy thing right


---------37:58----------
like it's actually your


---------37:59----------
intolerance of their pain that drives


---------38:01----------
you to act


---------38:02----------
which means there actually isn't you're


---------38:04----------
not placing their feelings above your


---------38:06----------
own


---------38:07----------
i mean that's true it's the other way


---------38:09----------
around even though it's done with love


---------38:12----------
but it's it's really tricky


---------38:16----------
right but it's your intolerance


---------38:19----------
and this is why like i i mean i think


---------38:21----------
could be anticlimactic but this could be


---------38:23----------
a huge part of it


---------38:25----------
right because when you say like i don't


---------38:27----------
understand why someone would


---------38:30----------
you know forgive someone who's cheated


---------38:33----------
on them twice


---------38:34----------
absolutely and that's where you screw up


---------38:37----------
because you don't like


---------38:38----------
they're not stupid man


---------38:41----------
like they understand that their


---------38:42----------
girlfriend cheated on them twice and


---------38:44----------
you're missing a huge part of the puzzle


---------38:46----------
if they're going back


---------38:49----------
that's true and so then what you do is


---------38:52----------
you try to push them based on your


---------38:54----------
standard


---------38:55----------
which once again like i know it's gonna


---------38:57----------
happen again like you can't see the


---------38:58----------
future no one can


---------39:00----------
yeah you know so it's kind of


---------39:03----------
interesting because like


---------39:04----------
i think like part of the problem when


---------39:05----------
you say like i think you're sort of


---------39:07----------
right


---------39:08----------
in the sense that are you abrasive yes


---------39:10----------
like i think that


---------39:11----------
the tricky thing here is that you're


---------39:12----------
abrasive but you're also like kind of


---------39:14----------
justified right


---------39:15----------
you're not like telling people things


---------39:16----------
that are like super distort like it's


---------39:18----------
not unreasonable to think that


---------39:21----------
hey if like this this person that you're


---------39:23----------
dating cheats on you twice like maybe


---------39:25----------
you should find someone else


---------39:27----------
yeah but i do think that something


---------39:29----------
you're probably missing something


---------39:31----------
because if the primary if if you are


---------39:33----------
able to if you are not


---------39:34----------
able to emotionally tolerate your


---------39:37----------
friends like making mistakes


---------39:38----------
and doing in your mind stupid things


---------39:42----------
yeah that emotional intolerance is


---------39:44----------
probably blinding you to some


---------39:46----------
signals that they're sending your way i


---------39:49----------
agree


---------39:50----------
10 billion i think i think i started


---------39:52----------
realizing that when i played league of


---------39:53----------
legends


---------39:54----------
because whenever i would watch people


---------39:55----------
misplay in league of legends i would


---------39:57----------
lose my absolute [ __ ]


---------39:59----------
because like i can't see i can't stand


---------40:01----------
watching people make mistakes it drives


---------40:03----------
me [ __ ] nuts


---------40:04----------
so what's up with that


---------40:07----------
it's just annoying there's nothing


---------40:09----------
there's nothing oh it's so frustrating


---------40:11----------
because like in my mind it's like okay


---------40:14----------
well one plus two equals three


---------40:16----------
but then when i see people doing one


---------40:17----------
plus two equals five over and over and


---------40:19----------
over again


---------40:20----------
it's just like i [ __ ] wish people


---------40:22----------
could just get it a little


---------40:24----------
bit quicker and when i it it it because


---------40:26----------
like


---------40:27----------
just for once again like things just


---------40:28----------
make sense it's like


---------40:30----------
okay you you last hit the minions


---------40:33----------
and then once you last at their minions


---------40:35----------
and if you have more then you go for the


---------40:37----------
poke you go for the aggro


---------40:39----------
but then when i see people who like just


---------40:41----------
to talk in the the video game terms


---------40:43----------
when i see people who like shoot at like


---------40:46----------
shoot poke at people


---------40:47----------
and then they get minion aggro and then


---------40:48----------
they take more damage from the minions


---------40:51----------
then they did that they did the opponent


---------40:53----------
and they just lose but they think they


---------40:54----------
won it's just like


---------40:55----------
i i can't stand people having


---------40:58----------
i guess


---------41:02----------
it's hard for me to watch people make


---------41:03----------
mistakes it's hard for me to see people


---------41:05----------
who have i guess an illogical train of


---------41:07----------
thought


---------41:08----------
uh and it just irritates me no end


---------41:12----------
but how do you know or do they think


---------41:14----------
they're illogical


---------41:17----------
no they think that they're doing it


---------41:19----------
right so how do you know who's right


---------41:24----------
oh god uh well i guess back in the day i


---------41:26----------
would justify it by saying well


---------41:28----------
i'm this rank and you're that rank so


---------41:30----------
then i could use that as a justifier but


---------41:33----------
uh


---------41:34----------
that's also incredibly toxic what makes


---------41:37----------
that toxic


---------41:41----------
uh well i think i think flexing rank is


---------41:44----------
pretty egotistical


---------41:46----------
like i'm i'm underneath the mindset


---------41:49----------
i have i have a lot of very strong


---------41:50----------
opinions alok um


---------41:52----------
is it okay if i call you alok or sure


---------41:54----------
absolutely man okay i remember you


---------41:56----------
taught me an analogy i think i was i was


---------41:57----------
watching a lot of your vid i've always


---------41:58----------
watched your videos


---------41:59----------
you said an analogy where it's like it's


---------42:01----------
not it's not all wood it's all oak i


---------42:02----------
think that's what you said


---------42:04----------
yeah i love that so much um i guess i


---------42:06----------
have


---------42:07----------
i think my opinions are like borderline


---------42:08----------
too strong and that's


---------42:11----------
that's probably something i need to stop


---------42:13----------
because i'll say things like on stream


---------42:15----------
for example i don't think


---------42:16----------
people play league of legends because


---------42:18----------
they like league of legends i think


---------42:19----------
people play league of legends because


---------42:21----------
they're not doing anything


---------42:22----------
in their real life and when they get a


---------42:23----------
rank up or they go from bronze four to


---------42:25----------
bronze three they feel established even


---------42:27----------
though they didn't do [ __ ] all the


---------42:28----------
entire day and it means nothing


---------42:30----------
so like so john i'm going to reign


---------42:34----------
a little bit buddy so let's go back to


---------42:36----------
so so like i know it sounds kind of


---------42:38----------
weird but like


---------42:40----------
you your mind produces things that are


---------42:42----------
right right


---------42:44----------
i think so and your friend produces


---------42:47----------
things that are wrong


---------42:49----------
right i would agree with this yes


---------42:52----------
so how do you know who's right and who's


---------42:56----------
wrong


---------42:58----------
by showing them the errors of their


---------43:00----------
actions


---------43:02----------
but so if you if you get into an


---------43:04----------
argument with someone on league and you


---------43:06----------
say hey man don't poke unless you've got


---------43:07----------
creep advantage


---------43:09----------
yeah do they respond with some


---------43:13----------
incorrect logical argument


---------43:16----------
some friends yes and some friends know


---------43:18----------
so like then how do you know like you


---------43:20----------
have what you perceive to be a logical


---------43:22----------
argument


---------43:23----------
they have what they perceive to be a


---------43:24----------
logical argument right yeah


---------43:26----------
yeah how do you know who's right and


---------43:28----------
who's wrong you can continue trying to


---------43:29----------
convince them


---------43:30----------
they're going to continue trying to


---------43:31----------
convince you yeah by


---------43:33----------
i guess by demonstrating like showing


---------43:36----------
them


---------43:37----------
you know like okay well then let's go


---------43:39----------
into a game and i will show you right


---------43:40----------
now


---------43:41----------
and then i will so that may work in


---------43:43----------
league


---------43:44----------
but yes how do you resolve that in real


---------43:47----------
life


---------43:52----------
i have no idea so so here's the thing


---------43:56----------
so oddly enough i think that flexing


---------44:00----------
rank is about ego but like


---------44:02----------
let's be clear right so


---------44:05----------
sometimes i'll you know i'm i'm a crappy


---------44:08----------
player in dota


---------44:09----------
it used to be pretty good but you know


---------44:12----------
over the years


---------44:12----------
over the decades over the decade i've


---------44:15----------
you know drifted downward in skill and


---------44:17----------
dota players have gotten better


---------44:19----------
over a decade like i think the people


---------44:20----------
who still play like take the game pretty


---------44:22----------
seriously


---------44:23----------
and so like i think you can make a


---------44:25----------
strong argument that if i have an


---------44:26----------
opinion about what's right right and


---------44:28----------
what's wrong


---------44:29----------
and then there's like someone who's top


---------44:32----------
10 on the ladder


---------44:34----------
on the north american ladder who tells


---------44:36----------
me that i'm wrong


---------44:37----------
i think there's a reasonable argument


---------44:39----------
that we're like


---------44:40----------
i have no leg to stand on like


---------44:42----------
irrespective of how logical i think i


---------44:44----------
am and how logical they think they are


---------44:46----------
we both think we're logical but they're


---------44:47----------
just right


---------44:48----------
and i'm wrong by virtue of like an


---------44:50----------
objective


---------44:51----------
quantifier about our skill right yeah


---------44:54----------
so flexing rank is egotistical


---------44:56----------
absolutely but like there's no question


---------44:58----------
here that i'm wrong and they're right


---------45:01----------
so here's the question what's your


---------45:03----------
real-life


---------45:04----------
social rank


---------45:08----------
in my i have no idea how people perceive


---------45:11----------
me


---------45:12----------
i think i okay so on the internet


---------45:16----------
it's really high i think


---------45:20----------
in real life i can barely string


---------45:22----------
together sentences in front of actual


---------45:23----------
people


---------45:24----------
so this is where like i know it sounds


---------45:26----------
crazy but when your friend


---------45:29----------
decides to give this girl another chance


---------45:31----------
after she's


---------45:32----------
cheated on him twice yeah you know like


---------45:36----------
maybe be a little bit more open-minded


---------45:38----------
like when you ask the question like why


---------45:39----------
would anyone do that


---------45:41----------
actually try to find an answer because


---------45:43----------
they're not stupid right like


---------45:45----------
yeah there's gotta be like the more the


---------45:48----------
worse that she treats him


---------45:51----------
the bigger the reason because that


---------45:52----------
there's a scale in their mind


---------45:55----------
right like this person has cheated on me


---------45:57----------
twice i should break up with them


---------45:59----------
but there's got to be something stronger


---------46:01----------
than that negative that's keeping them


---------46:03----------
in the relationship


---------46:05----------
my my mind is because i i'm very


---------46:08----------
i'm very asexual like i i don't give a


---------46:10----------
[ __ ] about sex


---------46:11----------
it's like in my mind i'm just like okay


---------46:13----------
well maybe the sex is really good


---------46:15----------
and that's the only thing i ever think


---------46:17----------
of and that's probably my bet because


---------46:18----------
i'm out of power yeah so


---------46:19----------
here's here's where i think we run into


---------46:21----------
the problem john


---------46:23----------
yes when you don't know something in


---------46:25----------
your mind


---------46:26----------
where do you go to for answers


---------46:31----------
how do you so when you say i don't


---------46:33----------
understand why they're in a relationship


---------46:35----------
how did you figure out what conclusion


---------46:37----------
do you come to


---------46:38----------
it must be for the sex yeah it's messed


---------46:41----------
with effects and also


---------46:42----------
this particular friend has been cheated


---------46:44----------
on in every single one of his


---------46:45----------
relationships


---------46:46----------
okay this particular one so i figured


---------46:47----------
okay well it's just gonna happen again


---------46:49----------
uh and then for all other questions i'm


---------46:51----------
just like i'm just google it


---------46:52----------
every single time i have a single


---------46:54----------
question my head ever i'm so google it


---------46:56----------
let me share something with you if you


---------46:58----------
don't understand something in a


---------47:00----------
relationship


---------47:01----------
maybe try asking the other person


---------47:04----------
i have never tried that once ever and


---------47:07----------
therein lies i think a major piece of


---------47:10----------
social conditioning that you probably


---------47:12----------
never saw at home


---------47:39----------
that makes a lot of sense


---------47:44----------
i i can honestly say i've never done


---------47:46----------
that a single time


---------47:47----------
ever


---------47:51----------
so now we're walking the tightrope


---------47:53----------
because how do you feel


---------47:54----------
john


---------48:00----------
i feel i feel really stupid


---------48:04----------
uh yep so do you remember no


---------48:07----------
do you remember what the tightrope is


---------48:10----------
we talked about it so we talked about


---------48:14----------
you know this whole thing about


---------48:15----------
accepting responsibility but like


---------48:17----------
like treating yourself with compassion


---------48:20----------
and being careful about blaming yourself


---------48:26----------
yeah so do you see how it's like because


---------48:29----------
it seems


---------48:30----------
so idiotic


---------48:33----------
right so let's try to be a little bit


---------48:35----------
compassionate and understanding because


---------48:37----------
i know it's kind of weird but i want you


---------48:38----------
to try to understand yourself


---------48:41----------
and in this moment you may feel like an


---------48:43----------
idiot but understand


---------48:45----------
what kind of upbringing does someone


---------48:47----------
need to have to where they like


---------48:49----------
never ask someone questions in


---------48:51----------
relationships


---------48:54----------
is it really that you're that idiotic or


---------48:56----------
simply that like you were never exposed


---------48:58----------
to it right


---------48:59----------
like it's really not your fault man


---------49:06----------
yeah that's crazy because yeah because


---------49:08----------
when you when you said that i had a i


---------49:09----------
had an issue with another content credit


---------49:11----------
where it literally all could have been


---------49:12----------
solved if i just sent them one discord


---------49:14----------
message


---------49:15----------
and said hey are you okay man but i just


---------49:19----------
i just don't do that and i don't know


---------49:22----------
why i don't do that


---------49:25----------
okay so it's so simple i


---------49:28----------
i literally don't get why i don't do


---------49:30----------
that at all well so


---------49:32----------
all the most brilliant revelations seem


---------49:34----------
simple


---------49:35----------
afterward right but like like so let


---------49:38----------
let's


---------49:39----------
now let's try to be like understanding


---------49:40----------
so like i know it's kind of weird but


---------49:42----------
you're making


---------49:42----------
that you're doing the same thing again


---------49:43----------
we're like let's try to


---------49:46----------
accept that there's a damn good reason


---------49:48----------
you don't do it instead of saying it's


---------49:50----------
stupid i should just do it


---------49:53----------
does that make sense yeah and it's weird


---------49:55----------
because the reason why that


---------49:57----------
why that affects me so much is like i've


---------50:00----------
literally never considered that a single


---------50:02----------
time


---------50:03----------
ever and i'm 27.


---------50:08----------
that i yeah that's shocking


---------50:11----------
so what's what's your understanding of


---------50:14----------
why you haven't considered it a single


---------50:16----------
time


---------50:20----------
i guess i judge people too quickly


---------50:24----------
and when i think someone's a bad person


---------50:28----------
i don't want to speak to them i don't


---------50:31----------
really i really i don't like hearing


---------50:33----------
them out


---------50:35----------
but i definitely should yeah so let


---------50:39----------
got to be careful john because your mind


---------50:41----------
is jumping to conclusions pretty quickly


---------50:42----------
okay


---------50:43----------
so now i'm going to share a couple of


---------50:45----------
other things so i think that the reason


---------50:46----------
that you don't do this


---------50:48----------
is because you were taught or there was


---------50:51----------
like an evolutionary


---------50:52----------
like you if your mind evolved in a


---------50:55----------
particular


---------50:56----------
like circumstance right like


---------50:59----------
you your mind evolved in a place where


---------51:02----------
black and white judgment was critical


---------51:04----------
like you had to like go all in like when


---------51:07----------
your mom is yelling at your two brothers


---------51:10----------
you don't have time to appreciate nuance


---------51:12----------
or ask her how she's feeling because


---------51:13----------
that's not gonna do anything


---------51:16----------
what you've got to do is like go black


---------51:18----------
and white you go ham you go hard and you


---------51:20----------
commit to an action and you follow


---------51:22----------
through completely because it's gonna be


---------51:24----------
a bumpy ride


---------51:25----------
you see that yeah and so like i i want


---------51:29----------
you to be really careful about blaming


---------51:31----------
yourself because like i think this is


---------51:32----------
the trick that you use to survive


---------51:35----------
because in in the environment you grew


---------51:38----------
up in


---------51:40----------
people who seemed to be bad like were


---------51:43----------
bad


---------51:45----------
like divorce one is followed by divorce


---------51:47----------
two three four five six and seven


---------51:50----------
that is staggering that is the most


---------51:52----------
diverse divorces i've ever heard of


---------51:56----------
yeah it's honestly quite impressive so


---------51:59----------
so like here


---------52:01----------
here's the problem like you're playing


---------52:03----------
like so the rules of the game that you


---------52:05----------
learned


---------52:06----------
are like a mod that's the way that i


---------52:08----------
want you to think about it it doesn't


---------52:09----------
make you stupid


---------52:10----------
it's just like if i started off playing


---------52:12----------
you know dota dota was originally a


---------52:14----------
warcraft 3 mod


---------52:16----------
right yes so like when i play dota and i


---------52:19----------
learn the rules of dota in the warcraft


---------52:21----------
3 engine


---------52:22----------
and then i play a game of warcraft 3 on


---------52:24----------
ladder


---------52:26----------
boy am i gonna feel stupid


---------52:30----------
because like the mod is just completely


---------52:32----------
different


---------52:35----------
but it's not that i'm stupid it's just


---------52:36----------
that like i've played with this mod


---------52:39----------
and there's this whole different rule


---------52:41----------
set and you just haven't


---------52:43----------
learned the rule set you've learned in


---------52:46----------
some way


---------52:47----------
right it's sort of like you're playing


---------52:48----------
like your micro is so intensive in


---------52:50----------
warcraft 3 that you even win some games


---------52:52----------
but in dota there's no such thing as


---------52:54----------
like mining gold out of your gold mine


---------52:57----------
and so you're not mining gold in


---------52:59----------
warcraft 3 and you're still


---------53:00----------
managing to win games because you're


---------53:02----------
missing some huge key


---------53:04----------
mechanical differences in relationships


---------53:08----------
and i think the reason that you get


---------53:09----------
called passive aggressive is because


---------53:11----------
you see your mind comes to a conclusion


---------53:14----------
and you don't really try to understand


---------53:15----------
someone else's perspective because like


---------53:18----------
in your experience that's been a waste


---------53:19----------
of time or not your experience


---------53:21----------
your brain is telling you there's no


---------53:23----------
point in doing that because you just


---------53:24----------
said i'm pretty sure i know when someone


---------53:26----------
is a pos like i can judge them very


---------53:28----------
quickly


---------53:29----------
yeah right so like that is the strategy


---------53:33----------
that worked that was the meta


---------53:34----------
in your household is there's like


---------53:37----------
there's the good apples and there's the


---------53:39----------
bad apples like very clearly like you've


---------53:40----------
got your sister


---------53:42----------
you've got your dad and you've got your


---------53:43----------
mom with your bad apples and then you've


---------53:45----------
got your one brother which is a good


---------53:46----------
apple


---------53:47----------
and you've got your wife which is a good


---------53:49----------
apple and you've got this other friend


---------53:50----------
who's a good apple and everyone else is


---------53:52----------
bad apples


---------53:54----------
but that conception i think the biggest


---------53:56----------
thing john is that i'm not


---------53:57----------
hearing space for another person in your


---------54:00----------
relationships


---------54:02----------
you are 100 correct that that is how it


---------54:06----------
goes with me


---------54:06----------
it's either we're like best friends or i


---------54:09----------
want nothing to do with you


---------54:11----------
and it's always been that way there's


---------54:12----------
never been there's never i don't have


---------54:13----------
acquaintances


---------54:14----------
it's either like i'm all in or i'm all


---------54:16----------
out a hundred percent


---------54:19----------
yeah so i i and and that too i think


---------54:22----------
that those are going to be like


---------54:24----------
unless you can navigate the shades of


---------54:26----------
gray like i think this is going to


---------54:27----------
continue happening


---------54:29----------
right because you're going to get super


---------54:30----------
tight with people super quick


---------54:33----------
and then like that's fine because both


---------54:35----------
y'all are like


---------54:36----------
you know nitro boosts all in for this


---------54:39----------
relationship


---------54:40----------
and then eventually like something is


---------54:42----------
gonna it's just not sustainable it's


---------54:44----------
just you can't


---------54:45----------
you know maybe with a wife you can swing


---------54:46----------
that right because you all are like tied


---------54:48----------
together and there's like no


---------54:49----------
coming back from that sort of thing but


---------54:52----------
i


---------54:52----------
i mean i think it's like i know it


---------54:54----------
sounds kind of silly but like i think


---------54:55----------
it's sort of like


---------54:56----------
you know i i i suspect that the more you


---------54:59----------
try to


---------54:59----------
understand someone else in your


---------55:02----------
relationships


---------55:03----------
the less passive aggressive you will be


---------55:05----------
perceived


---------55:07----------
because i think you're right that like


---------55:08----------
you don't make mistakes per se


---------55:10----------
right but that there's no understanding


---------55:12----------
of them so what you're doing you're


---------55:14----------
almost like


---------55:15----------
flying in this relationship blind like


---------55:18----------
you don't really know what they're


---------55:19----------
thinking or feeling but you sort of have


---------55:21----------
like a rule set that you follow


---------55:22----------
and since you're a smart [ __ ]


---------55:24----------
your rule set has become really good


---------55:26----------
you know how to like not make a mistake


---------55:28----------
in a relationship but there's no space


---------55:30----------
for the other person's thoughts feelings


---------55:32----------
perspectives


---------55:33----------
it's about right or wrong yep


---------55:40----------
yeah i 100 agree that makes a lot of


---------55:42----------
sense


---------55:43----------
help me understand why you agree


---------55:47----------
because first of all there's this other


---------55:50----------
thing that i do


---------55:51----------
in conversations which is and also if i


---------55:53----------
swear


---------55:54----------
i have this problem where i switch


---------55:56----------
topics a lot


---------55:57----------
i have a really hard time like locking


---------55:59----------
it in it's all good man


---------56:01----------
yeah as you were as you were speaking to


---------56:03----------
me about um


---------56:05----------
about like why i work the way that i


---------56:06----------
work and like the different rule sets i


---------56:08----------
was always thinking why do i get so


---------56:10----------
close with people so quick


---------56:11----------
and it's because i have like this


---------56:12----------
massive fear of like not having a good


---------56:14----------
conversation so like when i talk to a


---------56:17----------
new person


---------56:18----------
like i want it to be like


---------56:21----------
i watch too much goddamn anime and i i


---------56:24----------
want it to be like


---------56:25----------
oh like with every single new person i


---------56:29----------
meet


---------56:30----------
which is why i'm so rapid fire all the


---------56:31----------
time like i can't stand dead space and


---------56:33----------
conversation


---------56:34----------
and that leads me to where like if i get


---------56:37----------
that rapid-fire successful conversation


---------56:40----------
then okay we're best friends but then if


---------56:42----------
i don't get that then i'm like okay well


---------56:43----------
we're just incompatible and then i don't


---------56:45----------
know what to do with you


---------56:46----------
so yeah uh sorry my brain is


---------56:50----------
no all over the place that's i think


---------56:53----------
it's really helpful


---------56:54----------
i think your tangents are filled with


---------56:57----------
hidden treasure


---------56:58----------
so what i'm hearing there once again


---------57:00----------
like i want you to just pay attention to


---------57:01----------
this john that like


---------57:03----------
in a relationship when you say i don't


---------57:05----------
know what to do with you


---------57:08----------
yeah that's a very lopsided way to look


---------57:11----------
at a relationship


---------57:13----------
right because whose responsibility is it


---------57:15----------
to figure out how to make the


---------57:17----------
relationship work


---------57:19----------
that's mind slash ours


---------57:24----------
can't be both ours


---------57:27----------
that's the right answer is that the way


---------57:29----------
that you do it


---------57:32----------
no not really no there we go


---------57:36----------
right so if a conversation isn't going


---------57:38----------
bop


---------57:40----------
whose fault is it uh both of ours not


---------57:43----------
just mine


---------57:44----------
but what do you think it's my fault


---------57:47----------
absolutely i have to make it go


---------57:51----------
up yeah so you're accepting too much


---------57:54----------
responsibility for the conversation


---------57:57----------
yeah and then what happens is even if


---------58:00----------
you can make the conversation work


---------58:02----------
i know it sounds kind of weird but then


---------58:04----------
it's like it's a hundred percent you and


---------58:05----------
zero percent them


---------58:07----------
and that's just not sustainable in a


---------58:08----------
relationship


---------58:11----------
i agree 100 right so let's talk about


---------58:14----------
your wife for a second if you're okay


---------58:15----------
with that


---------58:16----------
i would love to so like what is your


---------58:20----------
what are your conversations with her


---------58:21----------
like


---------58:24----------
i act with my wife like with no one else


---------58:28----------
on this entire earth


---------58:30----------
um the moment i get off stream


---------58:33----------
that's why you've been together for 10


---------58:35----------
years but let's keep listening because i


---------58:37----------
think we've found our formula for


---------58:38----------
success


---------58:39----------
so let's hear it yeah with with frame


---------58:44----------
there's this little bucket of sunshine


---------58:46----------
uh


---------58:48----------
i instantly go to like you know baby


---------58:50----------
talking


---------58:51----------
like talking uh just goofing around


---------58:54----------
just we even have like this


---------58:58----------
our own terminology that we only use


---------59:00----------
with each other


---------59:01----------
uh it's just i can i can literally count


---------59:05----------
on one hand


---------59:06----------
the amount of arguments we've had in 10


---------59:08----------
years


---------59:09----------
because we just we've never done that we


---------59:11----------
just don't do that like i don't know i i


---------59:12----------
feel like frames is perfect for me


---------59:14----------
uh yeah she's just very nice she's very


---------59:16----------
understanding um


---------59:18----------
i definitely talk way more than she does


---------59:21----------
she is an incredible listener which is


---------59:23----------
great and


---------59:24----------
um she does not


---------59:27----------
understand anything in the world


---------59:31----------
so she comes to me for guidance on


---------59:33----------
pretty much every single decision she


---------59:35----------
makes in her entire life


---------59:36----------
because she just doesn't know what to do


---------59:38----------
because uh she also had a very her and i


---------59:40----------
have very similar backgrounds


---------59:42----------
um she got really messed up by a lot of


---------59:44----------
people and then um


---------59:46----------
when i came into her life i cleaned her


---------59:48----------
up um she had a lot of bad habits that


---------59:50----------
uh we got her to kick ones they're very


---------59:52----------
unhealthy for her body


---------59:53----------
um and i make


---------59:56----------
her happy and she makes me happy i


---------59:58----------
understand her 100 percent she


---------59:59----------
understands me understand uh


---------60:00----------
forgiveness is everything and uh


---------60:04----------
i'm underneath the mindset we're like i


---------60:06----------
don't think it's hard to not [ __ ] up


---------60:09----------
like i feel like it takes a lot of like


---------60:11----------
if you're in a relationship i feel like


---------60:13----------
it's very hard to [ __ ] up with somebody


---------60:14----------
if you truly care about them


---------60:16----------
so like her and i have pretty much never


---------60:18----------
[ __ ] up and and when


---------60:20----------
it has happened we talk about it on the


---------60:22----------
spot we have never gone to bed angry a


---------60:24----------
single time


---------60:25----------
whenever there's an issue we talk about


---------60:27----------
it instantly um and we also don't leave


---------60:29----------
each other's


---------60:30----------
side ever uh the longest she's ever left


---------60:33----------
my side was probably like an hour to go


---------60:36----------
to groceries other than that we go


---------60:37----------
absolutely everywhere together it's


---------60:38----------
we're


---------60:39----------
attached on the hip she's amazing but


---------60:41----------
yeah we do everything together we play


---------60:42----------
games together uh we watch the same


---------60:44----------
movies we watch the same anime and uh


---------60:46----------
yeah and she's just amazing


---------60:51----------
and when you guys have an argument and


---------60:53----------
y'all talk it out


---------60:55----------
yeah do you usually find that she ends


---------60:57----------
up


---------60:59----------
understanding your perspective pretty


---------61:00----------
well yes


---------61:03----------
do you understand her perspective pretty


---------61:05----------
well yes


---------61:10----------
like like i'll i'll have no idea how


---------61:13----------
like she'll came


---------61:14----------
to do what she did but then after she


---------61:18----------
explains it


---------61:19----------
i just think oh okay well she never


---------61:22----------
learned


---------61:22----------
that doing that was wrong and then i


---------61:25----------
feel


---------61:26----------
it's okay


---------61:30----------
so are you wrong in the relationship


---------61:36----------
ever


---------61:41----------
i i okay now this is a this is a tricky


---------61:44----------
situation though


---------61:47----------
yeah because i get afraid


---------61:50----------
of my wife because she's never


---------61:54----------
ever mad at me she and i can say this


---------61:56----------
honestly she has said i have


---------61:58----------
never made a mistake ever and that


---------62:01----------
freaks me out


---------62:02----------
because the reason why that freaks me


---------62:03----------
out is is now that we're 10 years into a


---------62:05----------
relationship


---------62:08----------
if i do [ __ ] up and she hasn't seen this


---------62:11----------
before


---------62:12----------
is it going to be okay but i can


---------62:14----------
honestly say this genuinely


---------62:17----------
she has told me and like i'll even say


---------62:20----------
are you sure you're okay with what


---------62:21----------
happened are you sure you're okay


---------62:23----------
and she's like it's absolutely okay i


---------62:25----------
understand


---------62:26----------
it's not a problem she no i can honestly


---------62:29----------
say i've


---------62:30----------
i hate saying that it makes me feel like


---------62:32----------
such a dick but no i can honestly say i


---------62:33----------
have


---------62:34----------
in her eyes never been wrong even even


---------62:37----------
when i feel that i am


---------62:39----------
when i feel that i [ __ ] up she'll


---------62:41----------
still say no you're good


---------62:42----------
it's okay what do you think about that


---------62:46----------
it freaks me the [ __ ] out what freaks


---------62:48----------
you out about it


---------62:50----------
i feel like my wife is way too accepting


---------62:52----------
of me


---------62:54----------
like too accepting like it's like


---------62:59----------
it's it is [ __ ] weird because i'm


---------63:01----------
just like


---------63:02----------
i feel like i [ __ ] up here why is she


---------63:04----------
not mad at me why is she never angry at


---------63:05----------
me


---------63:06----------
like ever and it's been like this way


---------63:08----------
for a decade a decade


---------63:12----------
like a [ __ ] decade dude


---------63:15----------
so it is scary what's scary about it


---------63:20----------
i i feel like there's something in her


---------63:22----------
brain that's wired


---------63:24----------
strangely to make her over forgiving


---------63:26----------
because i i will say my wife has come


---------63:28----------
from


---------63:28----------
very abusive relationships very abusive


---------63:31----------
and in my head i'm like


---------63:34----------
has my wife been conditioned to just


---------63:37----------
forgiving poor behavior out of fear


---------63:39----------
for herself and is that happening with


---------63:42----------
us sure


---------63:44----------
so i think that that's a reasonable


---------63:46----------
hypothesis right


---------63:47----------
yeah and then the other thing to kind of


---------63:49----------
think a little bit about is


---------63:53----------
so so i think the reason y'all's


---------63:56----------
relationship works is because there's


---------63:59----------
matching conditioning


---------64:03----------
okay right that that like if you kind of


---------64:04----------
think about it you're telling me that


---------64:05----------
you have relationship problems with a


---------64:07----------
lot of people


---------64:08----------
but that this seems to be like a very


---------64:10----------
successful relationship


---------64:11----------
and what i'm hearing is that both of you


---------64:13----------
guys were kind of like screwed up in a


---------64:15----------
particular way


---------64:16----------
but the way that each of you has sort of


---------64:19----------
like cracked and fractured


---------64:20----------
sort of fits well with each other


---------64:24----------
is that fair to say yeah yeah we also uh


---------64:27----------
we we also share the same mental illness


---------64:29----------
which is actually how we uh how we


---------64:30----------
bonded


---------64:31----------
okay and and what how do you understand


---------64:34----------
if she's sort of been conditioned in a


---------64:36----------
particular way to be overly forgiving


---------64:39----------
what kind of person does she need to


---------64:42----------
date to have a successful relationship


---------64:46----------
what balances that out


---------64:53----------
she's over well i guess a guy who messes


---------64:55----------
up a lot would make sense in my head


---------64:57----------
than


---------64:57----------
the yin and yang or someone who doesn't


---------65:00----------
mess up ever and that way she doesn't


---------65:02----------
get


---------65:02----------
mistreated are the two things that i


---------65:05----------
have in my head


---------65:06----------
yeah so i'd say the third thing is


---------65:07----------
someone who's not forgiving enough


---------65:15----------
man you are messing me up today jesus


---------65:18----------
yep


---------65:19----------
yep i agree


---------65:23----------
right so it didn't mean to body blow you


---------65:25----------
there but i recognize that may have been


---------65:26----------
a little


---------65:27----------
body blow yeah


---------65:31----------
i agree so we're gonna we're gonna try


---------65:34----------
to like


---------65:34----------
help you out there but and i i think i


---------65:37----------
think just to be fair it sounds like


---------65:39----------
you've made every effort


---------65:41----------
it's just her you know saint-like


---------65:44----------
forgiveness


---------65:45----------
outweighs yeah so i think she's just


---------65:48----------
she's out playing you there she's higher


---------65:50----------
mmr


---------65:50----------
so you've tried to accept fault time and


---------65:54----------
time and time again


---------65:55----------
but she just won't let you yeah


---------65:59----------
right but i i think the key thing here


---------66:01----------
i'm not trying to paint you out to be an


---------66:03----------
[ __ ] or anything like that i


---------66:04----------
recognize that there's gonna be like a


---------66:06----------
lot of blame and stuff


---------66:07----------
but i think it's just like i know it


---------66:09----------
sounds kind of weird but i've seen


---------66:10----------
people have this idea that


---------66:12----------
you know a successful relationship is a


---------66:14----------
particular thing


---------66:15----------
like it means that two human beings are


---------66:17----------
a particular way whereas


---------66:19----------
my experience has been actually that


---------66:20----------
like a lot of really successful


---------66:23----------
relationships


---------66:24----------
come when two screwed up people are like


---------66:26----------
screwed up in the right ways for each


---------66:28----------
other


---------66:30----------
and so so i think that there's something


---------66:32----------
about you know i i don't


---------66:34----------
get the sense that you're actually


---------66:35----------
abusive and so it's probably like


---------66:38----------
like and at the same time you know it


---------66:39----------
does sound a little bit


---------66:41----------
like there's a power dynamic in the


---------66:43----------
relationship or some degree of


---------66:44----------
codependency


---------66:46----------
there is a hundred percent of power


---------66:48----------
dynamic one billion percent


---------66:50----------
because like and i'm so sentient of it


---------66:51----------
i'm so worried about it


---------66:53----------
i asked my wife at least twice a week


---------66:55----------
hey if i were to mess up


---------66:57----------
you know it's okay to be angry at me you


---------66:59----------
know it's okay to tell me that i did


---------67:00----------
something wrong and she's like yeah i


---------67:01----------
just you never do


---------67:03----------
and i'm like all right and it's it's


---------67:06----------
uncomfortable for me it is uncomfortable


---------67:08----------
because i


---------67:08----------
i am so worried because of the [ __ ] that


---------67:11----------
she's been through that i will also be


---------67:12----------
part of the problem so i try to be so


---------67:15----------
cognizant of how she's feeling about


---------67:16----------
what she's doing why she's doing that


---------67:18----------
but it is


---------67:19----------
it is scary because i don't want to ever


---------67:22----------
do anything to hurt her ever


---------67:23----------
yeah i get that john so i'm going to try


---------67:25----------
to equip you with a slightly different


---------67:27----------
approach right so when you say you know


---------67:29----------
it's okay to be angry with me


---------67:31----------
yeah who has the power in that


---------67:34----------
relationship


---------67:37----------
that's me giving her permission to


---------67:40----------
absolutely permission is the right word


---------67:42----------
yep right so then the question


---------67:45----------
so what i would what i would recommend i


---------67:47----------
think here's the big thing right so like


---------67:48----------
you'll give her permission


---------67:50----------
but i'm not hearing a question


---------67:55----------
right so i think the biggest thing that


---------67:57----------
you need to add to your relationships is


---------67:59----------
questions


---------68:00----------
okay so like like what i would recommend


---------68:03----------
to you uh


---------68:04----------
or am i making you feel like an [ __ ]


---------68:08----------
no you are it feels like i have a puzzle


---------68:11----------
in my head that you're adding more


---------68:12----------
pieces than salt yeah


---------68:13----------
so so the next time you think you screw


---------68:15----------
up


---------68:17----------
yeah and you ask her are you sure i


---------68:18----------
didn't screw up and she's like no it's


---------68:20----------
totally fine like it's fine she has


---------68:21----------
saint like forgiveness cool


---------68:23----------
but what i would really like encourage


---------68:25----------
you to do is like you know


---------68:28----------
switch characters for a second instead


---------68:30----------
of spamming


---------68:31----------
you know animo dps like switch


---------68:35----------
and then like you know go to like an


---------68:36----------
earth character and like use a shield


---------68:38----------
it's like a different shirt it's the


---------68:39----------
same button


---------68:40----------
but it's a completely different thing it


---------68:42----------
doesn't even do any damage


---------68:44----------
yeah but it will help you win the


---------68:45----------
encounter and ask her


---------68:47----------
can you help me understand why you don't


---------68:50----------
think i screwed up


---------68:55----------
yep right that's a damn good question so


---------68:59----------
so like and it's not


---------69:00----------
it's not about like permission or


---------69:02----------
anything because it's it's tricky


---------69:03----------
because i i don't doubt like i really


---------69:05----------
don't think you're sort of to blame for


---------69:07----------
this john because i think


---------69:08----------
this relationship like you guys sort of


---------69:10----------
managed to make it work like in a


---------69:11----------
particular way


---------69:12----------
so we don't want to like give her i know


---------69:15----------
sounds kind of weird but like it's going


---------69:16----------
to be like


---------69:17----------
very hard on both of you if the power


---------69:19----------
dynamic switches rapidly


---------69:21----------
right she doesn't know what to do with


---------69:23----------
it and you don't know how to let it go


---------69:25----------
so like y'all aren't ready for that yet


---------69:28----------
but at the same time i think the main


---------69:29----------
thing is when you have a friend you know


---------69:31----------
this is where like the main thing that


---------69:32----------
you need to learn is like


---------69:34----------
six out of the seven k or five out of


---------69:36----------
six characters you've got are gonna have


---------69:38----------
like an


---------69:38----------
r2 that does damage but like you just


---------69:41----------
need that one shield


---------69:42----------
right there's like a different dynamic


---------69:44----------
so when you have a friend who and this


---------69:46----------
is where i'd be careful about your


---------69:47----------
your like black and white judgments i'm


---------69:50----------
not blaming you


---------69:51----------
i'm not blaming that your mind makes


---------69:53----------
them right so like you've just learned


---------69:55----------
how to do that fine


---------69:56----------
but i think what you've got to


---------69:57----------
incorporate is like if your friend is


---------69:58----------
like dating someone again for like


---------70:00----------
the the next you know the nth time and


---------70:03----------
you're afraid that they're gonna cheat


---------70:05----------
you should try to understand them right


---------70:08----------
try to ask like what do you see in this


---------70:09----------
person and then share your feelings and


---------70:11----------
then listen


---------70:12----------
so another technique that i'm gonna do


---------70:14----------
is sometimes i get worried that this


---------70:16----------
person may cheat on you again


---------70:19----------
and then and try to instead of trying to


---------70:20----------
convince them ask them what do you think


---------70:23----------
about that


---------70:24----------
like instead of trying to convince them


---------70:26----------
ask why they disagree with what i'm


---------70:27----------
saying


---------70:28----------
or not even disagree because disagree


---------70:30----------
and agree means that one of y'all loses


---------70:32----------
and one of y'all wins


---------70:34----------
okay just open-ended like they can move


---------70:37----------
in whatever direction they want to in


---------70:38----------
the conversation


---------70:40----------
what do you think you know they say


---------70:44----------
yeah i know they may disagree i mean i i


---------70:47----------
know that they may cheat but like i care


---------70:49----------
about them so much


---------70:51----------
and then your mind is gonna tell you


---------70:52----------
that's idiotic


---------70:54----------
okay right


---------70:59----------
you restrain it john yep yep


---------71:03----------
um and and then then you can say like


---------71:07----------
it's hard but then you know you don't


---------71:10----------
this is where maybe you are a little bit


---------71:12----------
abrasive right yeah because then your


---------71:14----------
mind is gonna be like you're a dumbass


---------71:16----------
bro


---------71:17----------
yeah so don't say that right so so this


---------71:19----------
is where you can say i


---------71:20----------
i i'm i'm having trouble


---------71:26----------
like understanding like how you can be


---------71:28----------
so forgiving


---------71:29----------
and how you can like take that risk


---------71:32----------
again


---------71:33----------
can you help me understand like how


---------71:36----------
you're able to take that risk


---------71:38----------
it feels like it would be too much for


---------71:40----------
me


---------71:42----------
yeah and what you're saying is uh what


---------71:43----------
also helped click in my head is that


---------71:47----------
i can definitely this i don't know if


---------71:48----------
it's passive aggressive or aggressive or


---------71:50----------
it's just a [ __ ] dick thing to do


---------71:52----------
but when i have in the past asked people


---------71:55----------
like


---------71:55----------
how the how the [ __ ] could you possibly


---------71:57----------
think that and they give me their


---------71:58----------
rationale


---------72:00----------
i have this really bad habit where when


---------72:02----------
i get frustrated i start laughing


---------72:04----------
and it's really bad because it's really


---------72:06----------
offensive but uh yeah


---------72:08----------
because like i'll be like okay so you


---------72:09----------
don't think she's going to do this again


---------72:11----------
no she won't do it again i'll i'll just


---------72:13----------
start


---------72:13----------
laughing hysterically which is really


---------72:15----------
bad it's really that is bad


---------72:17----------
yeah it's like i yeah i smile when i get


---------72:19----------
angry i laugh when i get angry


---------72:21----------
um and um yeah i i pretty much mask


---------72:24----------
everything when i get sad so that's


---------72:26----------
something that i need to i need to


---------72:27----------
[ __ ] stop and it's it's not like


---------72:29----------
extend it's just like like just one loud


---------72:32----------
laugh it's


---------72:33----------
it's bad yeah yeah so it's it's it comes


---------72:35----------
across as very condescending


---------72:37----------
yes it does yes it does it is horrible


---------72:40----------
and so so i'd say you know tips there


---------72:43----------
are first of all let people know that


---------72:44----------
that's how you like you have a lot of


---------72:46----------
trouble processing negative emotions


---------72:48----------
the other thing you can do is apologize


---------72:51----------
yes


---------72:52----------
um and and then once again like when


---------72:54----------
when you apologize like listen to them


---------72:56----------
like don't apologize for what you feel


---------72:58----------
bad for


---------72:59----------
i know it sounds kind of weird but


---------73:01----------
apologize for


---------73:02----------
how they are hurt and that involves


---------73:05----------
listening to them first


---------73:06----------
so you'll probably like if you laugh


---------73:08----------
inappropriately you'll be like i'm so


---------73:09----------
sorry that was a mean thing to do


---------73:11----------
but once again there's not room for them


---------73:13----------
to tell you like whether it was okay or


---------73:14----------
not okay


---------73:17----------
does that make sense so i think the


---------73:19----------
biggest thing john is like and i think


---------73:20----------
the passive aggressive stuff will sort


---------73:22----------
of go away because i think you've


---------73:23----------
learned


---------73:24----------
how to not break the rules of the


---------73:25----------
relationship but also


---------73:27----------
like you manage to not let other people


---------73:30----------
be in the relationship


---------73:32----------
yeah and and so that's gonna come across


---------73:36----------
as like


---------73:36----------
and they don't know how to like point


---------73:38----------
this out right because they're like


---------73:40----------
they don't know what else to call it


---------73:41----------
because you're not really doing anything


---------73:43----------
wrong


---------73:43----------
it's just you're not giving them space


---------73:45----------
to participate in the conversation


---------73:47----------
you're not trying to really understand


---------73:48----------
them and stuff like that


---------73:49----------
which you know you got to be careful


---------73:52----------
about


---------73:53----------
i think that's another thing that i


---------73:54----------
greatly made a mistake with


---------73:56----------
was that even though i'm all in on them


---------73:59----------
i never asked if they were all in on me


---------74:02----------
or whether they're okay with you being


---------74:04----------
all in on them


---------74:05----------
exactly and so like i will joke with


---------74:08----------
people


---------74:09----------
who i love but then i realize they're


---------74:11----------
indifferent about me


---------74:12----------
so that the jokes i say towards them are


---------74:14----------
perceived as passive aggressiveness


---------74:16----------
when in reality it's just a joke and if


---------74:18----------
we were as close


---------74:19----------
together as i thought we were then it


---------74:22----------
would have just been


---------74:23----------
we're bodies at least in my head so i


---------74:26----------
think i need


---------74:26----------
before i joke with people i need to make


---------74:28----------
sure that we're as good as each other


---------74:31----------
like i think


---------74:32----------
yeah so so you you got to be careful


---------74:34----------
because like like there's the problem


---------74:36----------
it's


---------74:36----------
super subtle i'd say like go back and


---------74:38----------
watch this vod but pay attention to your


---------74:40----------
words you said


---------74:42----------
they we weren't that tight and in


---------74:44----------
reality


---------74:46----------
and then you share your opinion it's


---------74:48----------
like really interesting how you


---------74:49----------
construct it because you're saying that


---------74:50----------
there's


---------74:50----------
you're right at the end but it's it's


---------74:52----------
really in i don't know how to like


---------74:53----------
highlight this but you said


---------74:55----------
i said something and they perceived it


---------74:57----------
this way


---------74:58----------
but in reality this is really what it


---------75:01----------
was


---------75:02----------
whereas no it's not in reality like


---------75:04----------
that's a whole problem


---------75:05----------
it's like their perceptions are just as


---------75:07----------
valid as yours okay


---------75:11----------
right and and yeah i've i've been told i


---------75:13----------
do something weird when i talk


---------75:15----------
so i'm thinking you just told me what


---------75:16----------
that was so i think i need to identify


---------75:18----------
that


---------75:18----------
yeah like i would say like literally go


---------75:20----------
back and like watch this time stamp in


---------75:22----------
the vaude because


---------75:23----------
what i'm noticing in your mind is like


---------75:25----------
they have a perception


---------75:27----------
but you are entitled to the reality of


---------75:29----------
the situation


---------75:31----------
which is the whole crux of the problem


---------75:33----------
yeah


---------75:34----------
right so like like this is where like


---------75:36----------
communication it's not like


---------75:38----------
one party has the reality of it


---------75:42----------
yeah because their reality is just as


---------75:43----------
important as my reality


---------75:45----------
absolutely so even though i i know my


---------75:48----------
intentions


---------75:49----------
they don't know my intentions so that


---------75:51----------
doesn't justify the reality in my


---------75:52----------
perception because the reality


---------75:54----------
is both bars combined not by exclusively


---------75:57----------
exactly


---------76:00----------
let's go dr k you're you're a goddamn


---------76:02----------
magician jesus


---------76:07----------
it's nice to have a five-star character


---------76:10----------
to talk to


---------76:11----------
because yeah everything is just gonna


---------76:12----------
work better your stats are just better


---------76:15----------
yeah i agree god damn you're you're


---------76:20----------
doing really well john you're


---------76:21----------
able to tolerate a lot of things that um


---------76:24----------
you know can be like very devastating to


---------76:26----------
feel


---------76:28----------
yeah i'm i'm trying i see that i see


---------76:31----------
that


---------76:31----------
i'm not you know i'm not being i'm not


---------76:34----------
whole


---------76:35----------
i'm not pulling my punches yeah


---------76:38----------
so you know and i appreciate that


---------76:41----------
because i feel like i've beaten this for


---------76:42----------
a very long time


---------76:43----------
yeah i mean i i appreciate it too


---------76:44----------
because i i try you know i don't


---------76:47----------
i yeah


---------76:50----------
i try not to pull my punches when people


---------76:52----------
can handle it


---------76:54----------
yeah but handling it is tough so so be


---------76:56----------
careful because you know today tomorrow


---------76:58----------
the next week


---------76:59----------
there may be like residual feelings of


---------77:01----------
that blame and that guilt or i'm such an


---------77:03----------
[ __ ] and things like that like those


---------77:05----------
may come up


---------77:06----------
um you know so just be prepared for


---------77:09----------
those it doesn't mean that they're true


---------77:10----------
because once again those are thoughts


---------77:12----------
produced by your mind


---------77:13----------
they're your black and white thinking


---------77:15----------
telling you oh my god i can't believe i


---------77:18----------
have been so dumb right like it's it's


---------77:20----------
all like be careful because that black


---------77:22----------
and white thinking may cause you to


---------77:23----------
conclude particular things which i want


---------77:25----------
you to


---------77:26----------
be careful of of course i don't think


---------77:29----------
you're


---------77:30----------
a bad person i think that you just


---------77:32----------
haven't learned how to do this yet


---------77:34----------
and that's because you weren't taught


---------77:36----------
like it was you were never given the


---------77:38----------
opportunity


---------77:42----------
right


---------77:44----------
questions thoughts uh


---------77:48----------
well i i think i think i will be okay


---------77:50----------
with self-depreciation


---------77:53----------
because now that i know


---------77:56----------
this information you've given to me i i


---------77:58----------
think i'm gonna be okay


---------78:00----------
i know that i have some apologizing to


---------78:02----------
do for sure


---------78:03----------
um but i think i'm gonna be able to i


---------78:06----------
guess understand myself and understand


---------78:07----------
other people a lot more better


---------78:09----------
or just a lot better sorry uh


---------78:13----------
another question you've been making a


---------78:15----------
lot of references to the game that i


---------78:16----------
played do you know what gadget impact is


---------78:18----------
yeah i just uh so i i heard that you


---------78:19----------
were a gentian impact streamer and i


---------78:21----------
literally installed gunship


---------78:22----------
like three years uh three weeks ago


---------78:26----------
so i've been playing it like how does he


---------78:28----------
know what agamo is that's like okay


---------78:30----------
that's crazy


---------78:31----------
yeah all i know about you is that you're


---------78:33----------
against an impact streamer that's all i


---------78:34----------
knew yeah


---------78:35----------
yeah of course um that's like another


---------78:39----------
question i had


---------78:40----------
oh man i wish i wrote these down you've


---------78:42----------
helped me with so much


---------78:44----------
and i know i'm gonna be able to use this


---------78:45----------
really good for the future


---------78:47----------
um


---------78:51----------
oh yeah then you said don't you don't


---------78:54----------
have to respond to that


---------78:57----------
i think


---------79:04----------
i guess another random question is yeah


---------79:07----------
i don't know if i'll do anything


---------79:08----------
um how how much time do you think


---------79:12----------
i should be getting away from my


---------79:14----------
computer and devices


---------79:16----------
because i'm on them non-stop like that's


---------79:19----------
probably not good for me right


---------79:20----------
what do you think i think i should


---------79:23----------
minimize my time content creating


---------79:25----------
by so much because i'm doing that for


---------79:27----------
like 12 14 hours a day


---------79:29----------
uh and then i try to get away from my


---------79:31----------
computer but


---------79:32----------
wait oh yes okay this is the real


---------79:35----------
question i want to ask that one i i'm


---------79:37----------
pretty sure i can handle it i want to i


---------79:38----------
want to get the computer a lot more


---------79:39----------
but what i wanted to say is i have this


---------79:41----------
problem where sometimes i get afraid of


---------79:43----------
speaking


---------79:44----------
because i i i analyze everything that i


---------79:48----------
say


---------79:48----------
and i try to limit the amount that


---------79:51----------
people can intuit from what i say


---------79:53----------
that way i can say correct statements


---------79:55----------
like so


---------79:56----------
all before i say anything and i'm a


---------79:58----------
really quick thinker i'm like if i say


---------80:00----------
this


---------80:00----------
it will trigger that if i say this it


---------80:03----------
will give them


---------80:04----------
that idea that's really bad to do


---------80:08----------
right yeah so john all roads


---------80:11----------
lead to home or rome so let me ask you


---------80:15----------
when you do that you're in a


---------80:16----------
conversation right


---------80:18----------
yes so are you playing a single player


---------80:21----------
game


---------80:21----------
or a co-op game go off game go off game


---------80:26----------
well no oh when i do that it's single


---------80:28----------
player absolutely


---------80:30----------
there's the problem right so you're


---------80:32----------
trying so hard to predict


---------80:35----------
and determine the rightness of things


---------80:37----------
that you say


---------80:38----------
but you're treating the other person


---------80:40----------
like an npc


---------80:42----------
yes i am right so like like don't rely


---------80:45----------
so


---------80:46----------
much on yourself and let them share some


---------80:48----------
of the responsibility


---------80:50----------
of like the conversation


---------80:53----------
okay right because like when


---------80:56----------
yeah yeah i knew that was [ __ ] up and


---------80:59----------
i knew it was so horrible


---------81:00----------
for me to do that i need to stop that i


---------81:01----------
need to stop that so much


---------81:03----------
because that that is the thing like


---------81:05----------
sometimes i'll be afraid to like join


---------81:06----------
like discord calls my buddies


---------81:08----------
because then i know like it's like


---------81:11----------
all right here we go like this needs to


---------81:13----------
go perfectly here we go


---------81:14----------
yeah so so let i'm gonna ask you


---------81:16----------
something john how do you think it


---------81:18----------
feels to be on the receiving end of your


---------81:21----------
conversations


---------81:25----------
i have been told it's very fun


---------81:28----------
yep i have been told that i make things


---------81:30----------
very fun


---------81:31----------
yep but


---------81:34----------
it's generally also not that fun for me


---------81:37----------
to do


---------81:37----------
because sometimes i just want to [ __ ]


---------81:39----------
chill yes


---------81:41----------
so what i would suggest or what i would


---------81:44----------
imagine


---------81:44----------
is that you dominate a conversation yes


---------81:47----------
i do


---------81:48----------
to the benefit of others sure because


---------81:50----------
it's like you come in and they get their


---------81:52----------
own personal stand-up comedian


---------81:54----------
but there's absolutely a comedian on


---------81:56----------
stage which is hilarious


---------81:57----------
and then there's an audience


---------82:02----------
right so like it's fun i i have no doubt


---------82:04----------
in my mind that being in a discord call


---------82:06----------
with you


---------82:07----------
is a riot but


---------82:10----------
i i also think it's closer to watching a


---------82:13----------
netflix special


---------82:15----------
on by a comedian than it is to a


---------82:17----------
conversation


---------82:19----------
because i think i think you occupy a lot


---------82:22----------
of space


---------82:23----------
in the room yep


---------82:27----------
yeah i would say my amount of real


---------82:29----------
conversations as you said i've i've


---------82:31----------
probably not had that many


---------82:33----------
yeah because yeah


---------82:36----------
yeah i agree what do you think about our


---------82:39----------
conversation


---------82:41----------
i thought it was a complete dialogue i


---------82:43----------
felt like it was two human beings


---------82:44----------
attempting to connect with each other


---------82:46----------
and i think that


---------82:47----------
i mean i i would say that we have


---------82:49----------
because


---------82:50----------
i've i feel like i've learned a lot i've


---------82:52----------
felt a lot and i think that's why i had


---------82:53----------
such a strong emotional reaction because


---------82:55----------
i i don't cry i don't but like i've my


---------82:58----------
my tear ducts have been exploding for


---------83:00----------
the past two hours too much my eyes


---------83:01----------
burn uh i feel like i've held a lot of


---------83:04----------
baggage and i feel like you've relieved


---------83:06----------
a lot of that stress and i feel like


---------83:07----------
this is


---------83:09----------
i'm gonna remember this for a long time


---------83:10----------
because i feel like there's gonna be a


---------83:11----------
big turning point for me and and i just


---------83:13----------
feel like our conversation was


---------83:16----------
very authentic what makes it a dialogue


---------83:22----------
how much more i was listening to you


---------83:24----------
than thinking about the things that were


---------83:26----------
coming out of my mouth


---------83:29----------
right and so i'm doing the same thing


---------83:34----------
yeah so you're you're giving me space


---------83:37----------
at times and then i'm giving you space


---------83:39----------
at times it's almost like you know we're


---------83:40----------
tossing a ball back and forth


---------83:43----------
which is really what a dialogue should


---------83:44----------
be like because you're not responsible


---------83:47----------
for


---------83:47----------
making the conversation work so i think


---------83:50----------
oddly enough this has been helpful


---------83:51----------
because you came into this


---------83:53----------
i i imagine that you may actually feel


---------83:56----------
less pressure so notice what i'm doing


---------83:59----------
i'm about to check in with you right i


---------84:00----------
have a hypothesis


---------84:01----------
so i'm going to check in with you we're


---------84:02----------
going to see maybe i'm right maybe i'm


---------84:03----------
wrong in a bizarre way i wonder if you


---------84:06----------
actually feel


---------84:07----------
less pressure in this conversation than


---------84:09----------
you do


---------84:10----------
in a discord call with your friends yes


---------84:13----------
i feel


---------84:14----------
pretty much zero pressure whatsoever and


---------84:17----------
how do you understand


---------84:18----------
why don't you feel pressure here


---------84:26----------
why don't i feel pressure here um


---------84:30----------
well one because i think that you care


---------84:33----------
and one i think that you are trying to


---------84:36----------
help me


---------84:37----------
uh and two i have a lot of trust in you


---------84:42----------
so i think i think it's a combination of


---------84:44----------
those three things


---------84:46----------
okay so i think those are all wonderful


---------84:48----------
things and i'd like to toss out a fourth


---------84:50----------
okay sure which is that you you're not


---------84:54----------
responsible


---------84:55----------
entirely for this conversation going


---------84:57----------
well


---------84:59----------
yeah right so you're putting some of


---------85:02----------
that responsibility on me


---------85:04----------
i think the reason it's a good


---------85:05----------
conversation is because we're actually


---------85:06----------
like seriously like we're going co-op


---------85:08----------
mode here


---------85:09----------
yeah whereas from what i've heard from


---------85:12----------
you is that a lot of times when you have


---------85:14----------
conversations


---------85:16----------
it's like you feel


---------85:19----------
so responsible for making sure the


---------85:21----------
conversation goes right that you don't


---------85:23----------
go into co-op mode


---------85:26----------
yeah i would agree with that right so


---------85:29----------
it's like


---------85:30----------
am i playing league of legends as the


---------85:33----------
adc


---------85:34----------
and it's me versus nine bots or


---------85:37----------
are we actually playing a team game


---------85:39----------
where like each person is supposed to


---------85:40----------
carry their weight


---------85:42----------
and actually if people like take farm in


---------85:44----------
the wrong place and start to carry


---------85:46----------
more than their weight it actually hurts


---------85:48----------
the team


---------85:54----------
yeah i'm saying that a lot i i sometimes


---------85:56----------
see some comments on my videos where i


---------85:57----------
do collabs with other people


---------85:59----------
where it says that like i'm very like


---------86:02----------
abrasive and then i was like very like


---------86:03----------
all-encompassing


---------86:05----------
yeah and then i realized yeah it's


---------86:07----------
because i was make i was i wasn't


---------86:08----------
trusting the other person


---------86:10----------
to help me out i was like okay we're


---------86:13----------
going to collab but it's going to be


---------86:14----------
[ __ ] awesome


---------86:15----------
yep oh we're going to do this but if i


---------86:17----------
just would trust


---------86:18----------
other people to be there with me then it


---------86:20----------
wouldn't be that way so now we come full


---------86:22----------
circle john


---------86:24----------
why is it hard for you to put trust in


---------86:26----------
other people


---------86:39----------
yeah so this is why we don't blame you


---------86:43----------
right like this is why it's unfair for


---------86:45----------
you to blame yourself


---------86:47----------
because like there's a damn good reason


---------86:50----------
in fact there are hundreds if not


---------86:52----------
thousands of instances


---------86:55----------
where you learned that you can't trust


---------86:58----------
other people


---------86:59----------
yeah they can't be relied on if she


---------87:02----------
cheats once


---------87:03----------
what's she gonna do you'll do it again


---------87:06----------
absolutely yep


---------87:14----------
jesus i'm like currently in my head


---------87:19----------
like playing every scenario where i'm


---------87:21----------
just like nah [ __ ] i'll just do


---------87:22----------
everything


---------87:24----------
yep i gotta stop that [ __ ]


---------87:27----------
be careful okay yeah of course so do you


---------87:30----------
wanna stop


---------87:31----------
yes be compassionate towards yourself


---------87:35----------
be patient with yourself you can't undo


---------87:38----------
28 years of programming


---------87:40----------
overnight just because you understand


---------87:41----------
what the problem is


---------87:43----------
right because like along with uh i just


---------87:46----------
i just got to do this [ __ ] myself


---------87:47----------
there's also the like like just think


---------87:49----------
about how hard it's going to be to like


---------87:52----------
not do that yep i'm not even kevin i'm


---------87:55----------
not even kidding with you dr k


---------87:57----------
uh for world of warcraft from vanilla


---------88:00----------
to i think i quit in the legion i was


---------88:03----------
the guild master


---------88:04----------
and raid leader of every single guild


---------88:06----------
i've ever been a part of and that was


---------88:08----------
even a myth because i was just like i


---------88:10----------
[ __ ] nobody's gonna do it better than


---------88:11----------
me i might as well just [ __ ] do


---------88:12----------
everything


---------88:15----------
yep this this has been ingrained in me


---------88:18----------
okay yep


---------88:19----------
because at first because at first i was


---------88:20----------
like oh yo i'm [ __ ] sick look at all


---------88:22----------
this [ __ ] that i'm [ __ ] doing


---------88:23----------
and then i realized oh it's i shouldn't


---------88:25----------
have done this i should just trust other


---------88:27----------
people to help me there when i need the


---------88:29----------
help it's going to be a slow process


---------88:33----------
yep you're gonna have to learn how to


---------88:36----------
tolerate a lot of like internal


---------88:39----------
discomfort in order to trust other


---------88:41----------
people


---------88:43----------
yeah right it kind of goes back to like


---------88:45----------
i can't


---------88:47----------
i can't bear to see my friends hurt


---------88:49----------
again


---------88:50----------
so that that's where like you got to


---------88:52----------
trust your friend


---------88:54----------
to make the right decision for himself


---------88:57----------
so it's going to require a lot of


---------88:59----------
tolerance on your part patience


---------89:01----------
tolerance and compassion for yourself


---------89:03----------
for them for


---------89:04----------
everyone in the universe yeah


---------89:07----------
and that may be tough because i don't


---------89:08----------
know that you were taught


---------89:11----------
how to like do that by your home


---------89:14----------
situation


---------89:16----------
yeah right what you were taught is like


---------89:18----------
survival of the fittest and the only


---------89:20----------
person you can rely on is yourself


---------89:24----------
yep yeah even even thinking about what


---------89:28----------
i'm having gonna have to do over the


---------89:29----------
next couple weeks months years is


---------89:31----------
is i can already feel like the


---------89:34----------
uneasiness of my stomach


---------89:36----------
but i do think well i know that it's for


---------89:38----------
the best


---------89:40----------
so i i will i'm gonna give it my


---------89:43----------
good old college try good that's cause


---------89:47----------
that's gonna be brutal yeah so


---------89:50----------
i don't think it's going to be quite as


---------89:52----------
bad as you think it is


---------89:54----------
because that's your that's your black


---------89:56----------
and white mind


---------89:57----------
telling you it's going to be brutal all


---------90:00----------
over again there are a couple of


---------90:01----------
different things here one is your black


---------90:02----------
and white mind but that's that's okay


---------90:04----------
like john like you're you're a good dude


---------90:06----------
and like as long as you care and just be


---------90:08----------
like patient with yourself like you'll


---------90:09----------
get there


---------90:11----------
you know like you'll get there bro


---------90:15----------
i mean i hope that would be that would


---------90:18----------
be pretty damn awesome


---------90:21----------
good i think hoping is the right thing


---------90:23----------
to do it may not happen actually


---------90:25----------
but like have faith in yourself you know


---------90:27----------
i've got faith in you


---------90:29----------
thank you i appreciate that


---------90:33----------
yeah thank you for this


---------90:36----------
hello i really appreciate this welcome


---------90:46----------
john


---------90:51----------
you'd think they'd teach you this you


---------90:53----------
know in school


---------90:54----------
over the the powerhouse of the cell is


---------90:56----------
the mitochondria


---------90:58----------
like teaching you some like


---------91:01----------
useful [ __ ] would be pretty nice oh


---------91:04----------
god


---------91:10----------
yeah so that's that's our mission right


---------91:12----------
is to teach people the stuff


---------91:15----------
and so what i want you to think about


---------91:17----------
john for a second is like you came on


---------91:19----------
here


---------91:20----------
you know you took a you took a few licks


---------91:23----------
from me


---------91:24----------
yeah yeah and so what you've managed to


---------91:27----------
do today is like


---------91:28----------
teach a bunch of people that are


---------91:30----------
watching


---------91:31----------
because you're not the only one my


---------91:32----------
friend a lot of people in our community


---------91:35----------
gravitate towards the lure of video


---------91:38----------
games because they do come from broken


---------91:40----------
homes


---------91:40----------
and it's what they love right it's like


---------91:43----------
it's like a place where


---------91:46----------
you know like this community can be like


---------91:47----------
really supportive it can be toxic but


---------91:50----------
can also be really supportive


---------91:51----------
this is sort of like like i i sometimes


---------91:53----------
feel like twitch has become the family


---------91:56----------
for people who like didn't have good


---------91:57----------
families growing up


---------91:59----------
yep i agree the donations and the


---------92:02----------
messages i get where they're just like


---------92:05----------
oh hey you know had a really shitty day


---------92:07----------
but i can always turn on this stream and


---------92:08----------
have a good time i'm just like


---------92:10----------
[ __ ] i love that but also i wish that


---------92:12----------
wasn't the case for you


---------92:14----------
yep that's actually a good


---------92:18----------
that's that's the way you want your mind


---------92:20----------
to work right you accept their


---------92:21----------
perspective and you can hope for


---------92:23----------
something else it's good it's a very


---------92:24----------
healthy dialectic just


---------92:27----------
it's like when you hold two contrary


---------92:29----------
thoughts that


---------92:30----------
together at the same time so it's not


---------92:32----------
black and white thinking what you just


---------92:34----------
did there


---------92:34----------
does that make sense yes yes it's like


---------92:38----------
it's good but it's also bad and that


---------92:40----------
yep right so that's not black and white


---------92:42----------
yeah


---------92:43----------
perfect exactly so i i think uh john the


---------92:46----------
more that your mind starts


---------92:47----------
starts operating that way the better


---------92:50----------
your relationships will become


---------92:52----------
i 1 billion percent agree right because


---------92:54----------
then it's like your girlfriend cheated


---------92:56----------
on you that's bad


---------92:57----------
and there's like there's still something


---------92:59----------
keeping you in the relationship


---------93:00----------
so the more that you understand that


---------93:02----------
kind of stuff the more that you're able


---------93:03----------
to like


---------93:04----------
meet people halfway bizarrely the other


---------93:07----------
interesting


---------93:08----------
thing that'll happen is they'll start


---------93:09----------
listening to you more too


---------93:11----------
yeah so when i'm trying to convince


---------93:15----------
someone or when i'm trying to help


---------93:16----------
someone get sober


---------93:18----------
i don't just talk about how bad alcohol


---------93:20----------
is that's what their partner


---------93:22----------
does and it causes a divorce what i talk


---------93:25----------
about


---------93:25----------
is how good it is and how bad it is


---------93:29----------
and we we sit on both sides of that


---------93:31----------
equation


---------93:32----------
and that's when i really see people make


---------93:34----------
the like the most change


---------93:37----------
yeah that's really smart that is very


---------93:39----------
smart


---------93:43----------
so it sounds like you meditate a lot


---------93:46----------
almost every night


---------93:47----------
for hours can you tell me about that


---------93:52----------
yeah so i have like this nightly ritual


---------93:54----------
where like i'll go upstairs


---------93:55----------
and then uh i'll turn on the water like


---------93:58----------
on to trickle down from the shower


---------94:00----------
and like the sound of the water will


---------94:01----------
like kind of block out the rest of the


---------94:03----------
noise in my entire house


---------94:04----------
um and then i'll just be able to sit


---------94:06----------
there and think about what i can do


---------94:08----------
to improve myself or or further my


---------94:11----------
career


---------94:12----------
or how to repair current relationships


---------94:15----------
or


---------94:15----------
what works in me what doesn't and i try


---------94:17----------
very hard to um


---------94:20----------
to to figure that out because i took


---------94:21----------
this course in college called


---------94:23----------
movement which was like how to make the


---------94:25----------
body go to a neutral state to where


---------94:27----------
it just it doesn't feel good but it


---------94:29----------
feels like nothing and that way your


---------94:31----------
mind can


---------94:32----------
like be free to wander and all that


---------94:35----------
uh i used to do yoga but now i'm way too


---------94:38----------
lazy for that [ __ ]


---------94:39----------
uh but yeah for meditation i guess i


---------94:43----------
i don't know if meditation is the same


---------94:44----------
thing as self-reflecting at length i


---------94:46----------
think it is


---------94:47----------
i think i i wouldn't quite call it that


---------94:50----------
but i think that there's just


---------94:52----------
some amount of overlap there oh okay


---------94:55----------
it sounds like what you're doing is i


---------94:57----------
would use the word contemplation


---------94:59----------
that's it yeah contemplation which is a


---------95:03----------
path of


---------95:03----------
spiritual growth but yeah


---------95:07----------
because i i do try to be the best person


---------95:08----------
i can be like the reason why


---------95:10----------
i strive so hard to like be successful


---------95:12----------
and like why i do what i do


---------95:14----------
is because i've kind of like seen from


---------95:16----------
the past what i don't want to be and i


---------95:18----------
think i actually grew more from knowing


---------95:19----------
what i don't want to be rather than


---------95:21----------
knowing what i do want to be by what i


---------95:23----------
want to be i just know what i don't want


---------95:24----------
to be


---------95:25----------
um and so then i kind of reflect on


---------95:28----------
why certain scenarios have happened in


---------95:30----------
my life and how to prevent those


---------95:32----------
scenarios from happening again


---------95:33----------
and sometimes i think i just get a


---------95:34----------
little bit too lost in the sauce up


---------95:36----------
there and uh


---------95:37----------
i might go a little bit overboard with


---------95:39----------
the analytical because sometimes like


---------95:41----------
i can like can't go to bed at night


---------95:44----------
unless i play a podcast or something


---------95:46----------
so that way because when i hear other


---------95:47----------
voices my brain will go blank


---------95:49----------
like if i don't have background noise


---------95:51----------
then my mind is just like


---------95:53----------
exploding information of like different


---------95:55----------
scenarios in my head


---------95:57----------
if that answers your question yeah that


---------96:00----------
that makes a lot of sense


---------96:01----------
i think the closest thing that you of


---------96:03----------
your nightly ritual which


---------96:05----------
sounds very healthy don't get me wrong


---------96:07----------
um is actually the listening to the


---------96:08----------
water trickle


---------96:10----------
that's i would say the thing that sounds


---------96:12----------
the most like meditation to me


---------96:14----------
okay so before the thought process


---------96:18----------
starts it sounds like you do a


---------96:19----------
particular practice to empty your mind


---------96:21----------
and once it's empty then you can point


---------96:23----------
it in a particular direction and it can


---------96:25----------
productively work


---------96:27----------
in that direction that is exactly it yes


---------96:30----------
so so i'd say the meditation process is


---------96:34----------
is really that first part gotcha


---------96:38----------
and and it's sort of focusing on that do


---------96:40----------
you um


---------96:42----------
i'm curious do you want to learn like a


---------96:44----------
more formal technique


---------96:47----------
um i think i think i know the one that


---------96:50----------
you're talking


---------96:50----------
it's the it's the nose one right that


---------96:52----------
one is do you know what i'm talking


---------96:53----------
about


---------96:54----------
yeah i mean i could teach you that one


---------96:56----------
but i'm just curious about whether you


---------96:57----------
want to learn something today


---------96:59----------
and it's not i would love to i was gonna


---------97:01----------
say i i remember the first time you ever


---------97:03----------
showed that technique


---------97:04----------
um i can't do that because i can only


---------97:07----------
breathe out of one nostril


---------97:09----------
so i wanted to do that one that you


---------97:10----------
showed i can't remember how it went but


---------97:12----------
that is one that i wish i could do but i


---------97:13----------
can't because only my left nostril works


---------97:15----------
not my right one


---------97:17----------
um yeah so i would say uh


---------97:24----------
let me just think for a second about


---------97:25----------
what to teach you


---------97:27----------
sure he said i know breathing is a big


---------97:29----------
part of everything and uh i do have


---------97:31----------
breathing issues


---------97:32----------
so that's always you sound kind of


---------97:34----------
stuffed up right now


---------97:35----------
yeah that's how i always sound which


---------97:37----------
sucks


---------97:39----------
uh what are your bowel movements like


---------97:42----------
uh before terrible like terrible


---------97:46----------
like i used to go like once every three


---------97:48----------
four days


---------97:50----------
uh but now i'm going like twice a day so


---------97:52----------
like i'm trying to really take care of


---------97:53----------
myself currently so they're pretty good


---------97:57----------
you go twice a day and how what's the


---------98:00----------
consistency of them


---------98:02----------
you know i mean they're pretty good i


---------98:03----------
mean not like


---------98:05----------
loose or hard or anything like that no


---------98:07----------
just good


---------98:08----------
once in the morning once before i go to


---------98:10----------
bed and you have allergies


---------98:13----------
just meant only meant but you're stuffed


---------98:16----------
up all the time


---------98:18----------
yeah what's your diet like


---------98:21----------
like what you have for a breakfast lunch


---------98:22----------
dinner yesterday or would you eat


---------98:24----------
yesterday


---------98:25----------
so i was 300 pounds at the beginning of


---------98:27----------
this year


---------98:28----------
i am now 276. i've changed my diet quite


---------98:33----------
drastically because before it was just


---------98:35----------
mcdonald's popeyes just junk food


---------98:37----------
but now when i wake up i have one apple


---------98:40----------
with peanut butter


---------98:41----------
uh and that holds me over till lunch and


---------98:43----------
then for lunch i'll generally have a


---------98:45----------
foot long sub from subway


---------98:46----------
and then at night i'll have uh one


---------98:49----------
chicken breast


---------98:50----------
with like one green pepper and then a


---------98:53----------
bed of rice


---------98:54----------
and that's pretty much what i eat every


---------98:56----------
single day


---------99:00----------
so i think your your nasal stuff will


---------99:02----------
get better depending on your diet


---------99:04----------
okay um let me just think a little bit


---------99:07----------
about


---------99:08----------
this for a second could i have 30


---------99:11----------
seconds


---------99:12----------
yeah okay real quick


---------99:17----------
a chat


---------99:21----------
you know what the hardest part about


---------99:22----------
streaming is


---------99:24----------
like with interviews is that i don't get


---------99:27----------
to read chat


---------99:30----------
so you know there's an interesting um


---------99:33----------
sort of like diagnostic concept from


---------99:36----------
ayurveda


---------99:38----------
that involves like toxin production


---------99:42----------
and um i think that's i've seen a lot of


---------99:45----------
like progress with like people who


---------99:47----------
really clean up their diet especially


---------99:49----------
with like upper respiratory like nasal


---------99:51----------
crap


---------99:52----------
i i don't know exactly how that works


---------99:54----------
and stuff have you seen like a doctor


---------99:56----------
about your


---------99:56----------
your nose always being stuffy uh i


---------99:59----------
haven't been to the doctor in about 10


---------100:00----------
years


---------100:01----------
um i got blood work done two days ago


---------100:04----------
which was terrifying because my wife


---------100:06----------
passed out 10 minutes after her blood


---------100:08----------
work


---------100:08----------
which i caught her as she was falling to


---------100:10----------
the ground it was terrifying


---------100:12----------
that's what freaked me because that was


---------100:13----------
the first time i ever thought that my


---------100:14----------
wife was dying


---------100:16----------
god it [ __ ] me up and that's the


---------100:18----------
reason why i'm still a little bit [ __ ]


---------100:19----------
up from it


---------100:20----------
um but i so when i was


---------100:23----------
17 18 i decided that i needed to get


---------100:27----------
away from my family


---------100:28----------
um and i just moved to canada and after


---------100:31----------
about a decade of being up here like


---------100:34----------
now my citizenship has like it's


---------100:37----------
it's they've accepted my application but


---------100:39----------
they haven't confirmed whether i've made


---------100:41----------
it or not so


---------100:42----------
until i get accepted or not is when i


---------100:44----------
will go to the doctor but before that i


---------100:46----------
was not able to


---------100:47----------
i would definitely recommend that you go


---------100:48----------
see a doctor and just you know get your


---------100:50----------
especially your nasal stuff checked out


---------100:52----------
man


---------100:53----------
yeah i agree but in terms of uh


---------100:55----------
meditation so like


---------100:56----------
it seems to me like you actually would


---------100:59----------
do well with something called the


---------101:00----------
pratyahara technique


---------101:02----------
so pratyahara means sensory withdrawal


---------101:06----------
so like essentially most of the speed of


---------101:11----------
the flow of our thoughts


---------101:13----------
is affected by our senses so the more


---------101:16----------
that our sensory


---------101:18----------
energy is dispersed the more chaotic our


---------101:20----------
mind will be


---------101:21----------
so if you kind of think about like a


---------101:23----------
light bulb that


---------101:25----------
is shining light in like a thousand


---------101:27----------
directions


---------101:29----------
versus a flashlight which is like


---------101:30----------
shining it in one direction with some


---------101:33----------
mirrors


---------101:34----------
versus like a laser beam which is like


---------101:36----------
highly highly concentrated


---------101:38----------
so like the process of getting our mind


---------101:40----------
from being diffuse and


---------101:42----------
all over the place this also has to do


---------101:44----------
with things like motivation for example


---------101:46----------
because if you think about someone who's


---------101:48----------
not motivated the reason they're it's


---------101:50----------
not that they're not motivated it's that


---------101:52----------
their


---------101:52----------
motivational energy is diffused in a


---------101:55----------
thousand directions


---------101:56----------
and we call that not motivated so


---------102:00----------
instead if we think about you know our


---------102:01----------
we have a certain amount of cognitive


---------102:03----------
energy that when dispersed


---------102:04----------
over a thousand directions we call


---------102:07----------
motivation


---------102:08----------
i mean sorry a lack of motivation and


---------102:10----------
then as we concentrate the energy of our


---------102:12----------
mind as we turn from a light bulb to a


---------102:14----------
flashlight


---------102:15----------
and then ultimately from a flashlight to


---------102:17----------
a laser beam so if we talk


---------102:19----------
you know if we think about like casual


---------102:22----------
law players versus


---------102:23----------
pro players they both actually may play


---------102:26----------
for


---------102:26----------
10 hours a day but what's the difference


---------102:28----------
it has to do with their focus


---------102:31----------
right um so so the fact that you sort of


---------102:34----------
like the the technique that you talk


---------102:36----------
about in terms of the listening to the


---------102:37----------
water trickle


---------102:39----------
is actually like a pratyahara technique


---------102:41----------
because it sounds like what you do is


---------102:42----------
you


---------102:43----------
you you put your attention on one thing


---------102:46----------
and it blocks out all of the other


---------102:48----------
things


---------102:49----------
and then as you block out all of the


---------102:51----------
other stuff your mind kind of gets


---------102:53----------
cleaned out and then you can engage in


---------102:55----------
some really


---------102:56----------
like fruitful contemplation does that


---------102:58----------
make sense


---------102:59----------
yes it does so what i would recommend to


---------103:02----------
use also because breathing is hard


---------103:04----------
um is a breath yahara technique that's


---------103:06----------
probably based on sound so what i would


---------103:08----------
ask you to do in terms of like a


---------103:10----------
meditation is to concentrate


---------103:12----------
on a particular sound how do you feel


---------103:14----------
about that


---------103:16----------
that sounds fantastic if there's


---------103:17----------
something i can do to kind of calm my


---------103:19----------
mind down that sounds like a great thing


---------103:21----------
that i would like to do


---------103:22----------
so when you wear headphones


---------103:26----------
and no one is talking what do you hear


---------103:30----------
uh it feels like somebody is muffling my


---------103:33----------
ears with like


---------103:34----------
cotton balls okay and so if if you're


---------103:38----------
if the sound from the outside is muffled


---------103:41----------
out


---------103:42----------
can you hear sounds from within your


---------103:45----------
body more clearly


---------103:49----------
sound from the outside is blocked out


---------103:50----------
can i hear sounds inside of my body


---------103:52----------
really i would say yes


---------103:56----------
okay so what we're going to do is sit up


---------103:57----------
straight


---------103:59----------
okay


---------104:04----------
okay okay and now what i'm going to ask


---------104:08----------
you to do is close your eyes


---------104:14----------
the first thing that i want you to


---------104:16----------
notice is the sound of your breath


---------104:30----------
just concentrate on that sound for a


---------104:32----------
second try to detect as much as you can


---------104:36----------
sort of notice the pitch


---------104:45----------
and now what i want you to do is listen


---------104:47----------
for the sound of your heartbeat


---------105:05----------
or even feel it if that's easier


---------105:11----------
are you able to find something yeah


---------105:15----------
tell me what you found


---------105:18----------
uh


---------105:22----------
i noticed that i'm not thinking about


---------105:24----------
literally anything else


---------105:26----------
okay


---------105:29----------
i hate the fact that i'm a mouth


---------105:30----------
breather i know that


---------105:32----------
uh i wish i could breathe my nose that's


---------105:35----------
okay


---------105:36----------
yeah and uh my heartbeat it's a lot


---------105:40----------
fainter than what i remember i used to i


---------105:42----------
i always thought it was super loud


---------105:44----------
okay powerful but it's actually quite


---------105:46----------
it's actually quite quiet


---------105:48----------
which i wasn't expecting okay so


---------105:53----------
listen carefully for it


---------106:10----------
the other thing that i want you to


---------106:11----------
appreciate john


---------106:14----------
is that all heartbeats are by definition


---------106:17----------
co-op can you can you hear the


---------106:20----------
co-op-ness of your heartbeat


---------106:23----------
is it like the buddha dump can you hear


---------106:27----------
that


---------106:29----------
i i feel like i can but i can't tell if


---------106:31----------
it's my mind telling me that i know that


---------106:33----------
it's gonna sound like that


---------106:35----------
or if i am hearing it it's very hard to


---------106:37----------
differentiate it


---------106:38----------
okay good so that means you're doing the


---------106:40----------
practice right


---------106:42----------
so meditation is about evolving your


---------106:45----------
subtle awareness


---------106:47----------
and this is what i will tell you when


---------106:49----------
you can securely


---------106:51----------
and confidently feel the co-op-ness of


---------106:56----------
the heartbeat


---------106:56----------
your relationships will improve


---------107:02----------
right now all you hear is one sound


---------107:05----------
you know there should be two but as you


---------107:08----------
get better at this practice and as you


---------107:10----------
hear


---------107:11----------
both parts of the sound as you start to


---------107:13----------
hear the dance


---------107:15----------
as you start to hear the duality of it


---------107:20----------
as you sit with that kind of i know


---------107:23----------
we're talking about like


---------107:24----------
understanding lane pressure now so it's


---------107:26----------
going to be abstract and cannot be


---------107:28----------
transmitted


---------107:29----------
it's not something i can teach you but


---------107:31----------
it's only it's something that can only


---------107:33----------
be understood


---------107:37----------
so as you listen for it if you do this


---------107:40----------
practice for a while and you begin to


---------107:42----------
actually be able to hear the concert


---------107:45----------
of two sounds your relationships will


---------107:49----------
start to get better as well


---------107:52----------
okay so listen


---------107:56----------
it's a pratyahara practice so pratyahara


---------107:59----------
means sensory deprivation that's


---------108:01----------
or sensory withdrawal it's a class of


---------108:03----------
practices


---------108:04----------
i don't know that this particular


---------108:06----------
practice has a name because i sort of


---------108:09----------
made it up just now okay that's good to


---------108:12----------
me


---------108:13----------
yeah right so there are a couple of


---------108:16----------
different levels on which this practice


---------108:18----------
works it also has to do with the anahat


---------108:20----------
chakra


---------108:21----------
so the anahat chakra is the heart chakra


---------108:24----------
and generally speaking people who have


---------108:26----------
trouble with like compassion


---------108:28----------
and things like that doing heart


---------108:30----------
oriented practices seems to work


---------108:33----------
okay um there's another set of practices


---------108:36----------
which are


---------108:36----------
specifically geared towards improving


---------108:38----------
relationships but i don't


---------108:40----------
i think that you don't actually need to


---------108:43----------
improve relationships this is like more


---------108:45----------
internal you need to be able to see the


---------108:47----------
other person in the relationship


---------108:49----------
and right now it's almost like iconic


---------108:51----------
that when you do this practice you know


---------108:53----------
what should be there but you can only


---------108:54----------
see one dimension of it


---------108:57----------
okay and so you need to be able to see


---------108:59----------
both of those and that this practice


---------109:01----------
will help you subtly detect that


---------109:03----------
okay okay


---------109:09----------
oh yeah my bad with my cat sending you


---------109:11----------
messages right now she was sitting on


---------109:12----------
the keyboard while my eyes are closed i


---------109:13----------
didn't notice


---------109:14----------
it's fine okay um


---------109:18----------
any any last thoughts or questions


---------109:20----------
before we wrap up for the day


---------109:22----------

---------109:25----------

---------109:27----------

---------109:29----------
