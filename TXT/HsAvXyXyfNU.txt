---------00:00----------
let's get started so welcome Scott you


---------00:02----------
said it's Scott yeah yes that's good


---------00:04----------
yeah yeah so Scott tell me a little bit


---------00:06----------
about you know what what's bringing you


---------00:10----------
on stream today and and how we can be


---------00:12----------
helpful I guess pretty much a core it's


---------00:16----------
just video game addiction okay so I play


---------00:19----------
way too many games okay like upwards of


---------00:22----------
pretty much like 18 to 20 hours a day


---------00:25----------
and I'll get a whole lot of sleep so oh


---------00:27----------
wow a lot of games yeah that's kind of


---------00:31----------
an average and it pretty much effects a


---------00:35----------
whole lot of stuff like friendships


---------00:37----------
relationships like outside of games and


---------00:38----------
stuff like that


---------00:39----------
sure and obviously like ability to get a


---------00:41----------
job so what are the things like gaming


---------00:44----------
is kind of like a kind like a recovery


---------00:47----------
thing for me like if I get some bad news


---------00:48----------
I could just go into a big spiral of


---------00:50----------
playing all the games and stuff like


---------00:51----------
that so okay mmm that kind of kind of


---------00:54----------
shifting away from that it's kind of


---------00:56----------
replacing it with something healthier I


---------00:57----------
guess I'll just hang out as a bit sure


---------01:00----------
um and can you tell me a little bit


---------01:02----------
about which games you play um a lot of


---------01:06----------
world warcraft um like way too much um


---------01:09----------
better league as well and fighting games


---------01:12----------
as well like which ones smash Tekken


---------01:15----------
mostly okay and in and what are you


---------01:18----------
usually doing Wow um at the when I play


---------01:21----------
classic and I just finished ranking and


---------01:24----------
classic if that makes me like ranking is


---------01:29----------
pretty much just like a competition of


---------01:30----------
no life like you like one to fourteen


---------01:33----------
everyone ranks up you get a certain


---------01:34----------
amount of points every week and if you


---------01:36----------
don't play for a week you lose points so


---------01:39----------
it's like notorious for just being like


---------01:41----------
no life you just have to keep no lifing


---------01:43----------
oh interesting so it's actually a


---------01:46----------
competition where who can put much time


---------01:48----------
and it's not skill at all interesting


---------01:52----------
really weird what do you mean by rank up


---------01:54----------
from 1 to 14 supreme it's like you get


---------01:57----------
from rank 1 to 14 used to everyone


---------01:59----------
starts at 1 and then you get punch like


---------02:01----------
a bracket system and so like whoever


---------02:03----------
gets the most honor in a week gets it


---------02:04----------
put into a bracket bracket 1 well


---------02:07----------
technically bracket 14 gives you the


---------02:08----------
most points and then gradually gets


---------02:11----------
worse they'll be like 7 people and like


---------02:12----------
a large server back


---------02:13----------
one kind of thing okay top bracket


---------02:16----------
they'll get the most points and then you


---------02:18----------
wreck up to 14 to get the Reg 14 is not


---------02:21----------
a PvP thing in game or is it outside a


---------02:25----------
game never I ain't gay ranked for things


---------02:27----------
like a you got like a title high


---------02:29----------
wallowed or grand marshal okay Nikita


---------02:31----------
the Kia pretty much okay okay so but so


---------02:35----------
so but the rank is determined by the


---------02:36----------
amount of honor and honor can just be


---------02:38----------
lined in right yeah yeah pretty much


---------02:40----------
like people bought it like all the time


---------02:41----------
like people just live and I'll track


---------02:43----------
Valley and just afk all the time okay


---------02:45----------
it's literally just to place the most


---------02:47----------
okay and and is that fun


---------02:49----------
um oddly enough yes but I've kind of got


---------02:53----------
like a like a ladder addiction like when


---------02:56----------
I see my name go up on a ladder


---------02:58----------
I get happier okay when it goes down I


---------03:00----------
get worse it was the same in League okay


---------03:02----------
like if I slow myself like getting lower


---------03:04----------
rank I wasn't as happy but if I was


---------03:06----------
going I was tapping sir okay


---------03:09----------
yeah what's I'm kind of curious about


---------03:12----------
that when you say happy what does that


---------03:13----------
mean um I guess it's like a progress


---------03:16----------
thing like when you see progress you get


---------03:18----------
happier like I guess it's kind of the


---------03:20----------
same if you had a promotion to work


---------03:21----------
you're happier you get a promotion in


---------03:23----------
league I'm happier if I got my rank I'm


---------03:25----------
happy and and so it sounds like you're


---------03:27----------
able to get a lot of happiness through


---------03:30----------
ranking up to to an extent and then you


---------03:33----------
realize like you're not this is all like


---------03:36----------
just a virtual thing it's like you don't


---------03:37----------
get any real life benefits from it I


---------03:40----------
guess how do you realize that when does


---------03:41----------
that happen um pretty much when I talk


---------03:45----------
to the people that I went to school with


---------03:46----------
and they're talking about things that


---------03:48----------
they've gained IRL like you know like


---------03:50----------
they just bought a new car or that kind


---------03:52----------
of thing how does that make you feel um


---------03:56----------
not the best kind of like I'm wasting


---------03:59----------
time I guess so okay so you feel like


---------04:04----------
you're wasting time when you're talking


---------04:07----------
to your friends no wasting time when I'm


---------04:10----------
playing a whole little while when I'm


---------04:13----------
doing you feel the feeling of wasting


---------04:16----------
time yeah I guess that's when I talk to


---------04:19----------
my friends and I I realized that if I


---------04:22----------
compare myself to pretty much the


---------04:23----------
average person they don't have a lot of


---------04:26----------
the life skills that they have Oh


---------04:27----------
or a lot of the experiences in life that


---------04:30----------
they have mm-hmm so it's all my


---------04:32----------
experiences pretty much comes from my


---------04:35----------
games okay hmm


---------04:38----------
I'm just thinking a little bit about


---------04:40----------
your brain yeah and the interesting


---------04:43----------
thing is that you know you know if you


---------04:45----------
present your brain with something that


---------04:46----------
makes you feel happy and then you


---------04:49----------
present it with something that makes you


---------04:51----------
feel bad your brain is gonna gravitate


---------04:54----------
towards the thing that makes you feel


---------04:55----------
happy


---------04:56----------
right we don't walk around punching


---------04:59----------
ourselves in the face because that's


---------05:00----------
beautiful and and so if I think about it


---------05:04----------
without what I would imagine that your


---------05:06----------
brain is actually telling you to play


---------05:08----------
more video games and telling you to talk


---------05:10----------
to your friends less yeah yeah pretty


---------05:13----------
much 20 cent that's pretty much how it


---------05:15----------
goes like I I used to play a lot of


---------05:18----------
league when it was like a thing that I


---------05:20----------
could play my school friends and then


---------05:21----------
kind of gravitated away from it when Wow


---------05:24----------
came out and it's less so of like a


---------05:26----------
friend grind it more of like a solo


---------05:28----------
grind like if I can stay up for like 20


---------05:30----------
hours and just played all the time


---------05:31----------
then I get the feeling of being happy in


---------05:33----------
the progression aspect in games while


---------05:37----------
not we're getting reminded of the whole


---------05:41----------
they're progressing and life think yeah


---------05:44----------
absolutely and and that too is kind of


---------05:46----------
tricky because I think sometimes our


---------05:48----------
brain doesn't know the difference


---------05:49----------
between I mean so the reason that we


---------05:51----------
feel like progressing so just think


---------05:53----------
about this for a second the reason that


---------05:55----------
you feel like progressing like how does


---------05:58----------
that work how do you have any idea how


---------06:01----------
you're you like how do you how does a


---------06:04----------
human being feel like they're


---------06:05----------
progressing like what's the circuitry or


---------06:08----------
mechanism behind that any idea um I


---------06:13----------
guess it's I really know like the


---------06:16----------
scientific way obviously but I mean I


---------06:18----------
guess it's just like the the emotional


---------06:20----------
value that comes with not being where


---------06:23----------
you previously were I guess but so you


---------06:27----------
know being somewhere that you weren't


---------06:28----------
feeling up I guess I don't know yeah yes


---------06:33----------
it's a sense of progress right yeah and


---------06:36----------
and where do you think this is gonna


---------06:38----------
sound that kind of a silly question but


---------06:39----------
where in your body does that sense of


---------06:41----------
come from like what on you finishes the


---------06:45----------
chest like I feel I feel a lot more


---------06:47----------
whole I guess mm-hmm kind of sad to say


---------06:50----------
I think but it's I feel a lot more


---------06:54----------
accomplished yeah just to know that if I


---------06:57----------
walk around like the main city that I'm


---------06:59----------
a higher rank then pretty much like


---------07:00----------
every player yeah so it just feels


---------07:02----------
better yeah and and so you know it's


---------07:05----------
kind of interesting we because we think


---------07:06----------
about addiction and you know a lot of


---------07:10----------
times like but we think about addiction


---------07:13----------
is a bad thing right like do you think


---------07:16----------
that your addiction to video games is a


---------07:18----------
bad thing I do yeah why because there's


---------07:24----------
a lot more efficient things I could be


---------07:30----------
doing with my life I guess like this is


---------07:33----------
a very temporary thing whereas like if I


---------07:35----------
look at like the French for example


---------07:36----------
who's working maybe like 40 hour weeks


---------07:38----------
at like maybe not the best job but he's


---------07:40----------
getting money and he's gaining life


---------07:42----------
skills he's updating like he's getting


---------07:44----------
something that's good for a CV whereas


---------07:46----------
I'm getting titles in a game and you


---------07:50----------
know is more efficient than yours


---------07:54----------
because it helps them more in the long


---------07:56----------
run I don't think that my addiction


---------07:59----------
helps me in the long run other than


---------08:02----------
maybe competitiveness and like addiction


---------08:05----------
help you does it help you yeah I mean in


---------08:08----------
the in the current time


---------08:10----------
it pretty much helps me with just


---------08:13----------
feeling whole I feel a bit happier while


---------08:17----------
playing more I guess yeah so why do you


---------08:20----------
say that his I mean so let me just let


---------08:22----------
me just think about this for a second so


---------08:24----------
I could go to a job that I don't like


---------08:26----------
very much


---------08:27----------
for the purpose of getting something on


---------08:30----------
my CV which also putting together a CV


---------08:32----------
doesn't make you feel whole or


---------08:34----------
accomplished it's just boring ass work


---------08:36----------
yeah and and then or I can feel whole


---------08:41----------
and happy and accomplished through


---------08:43----------
playing a video game why would I want to


---------08:45----------
do the former instead of the latter


---------08:48----------
because I feel like I don't know I see I


---------08:52----------
see a lot of things like a grind like


---------08:55----------
well ground and then there's like the


---------08:57----------
IRL ground kind of like if you're


---------08:59----------
working like a nine-to-five job Monday


---------09:01----------
to Friday you might not be in a happiest


---------09:03----------
state but it's the fact that you can


---------09:05----------
know that it's maybe leading towards the


---------09:07----------
right thing like towards the right thing


---------09:10----------
well it updates a CV it gives you maybe


---------09:13----------
a good reference if you do your best


---------09:15----------
then it can it can lead to the right


---------09:17----------
thing if you do it the right way


---------09:18----------
obviously if it's if I'm doing a job


---------09:20----------
that I'm absolutely depressed doing and


---------09:21----------
I have really bad work ethic that it


---------09:23----------
might not be a good thing mm-hmm do you


---------09:25----------
have a job but I don't why do you think


---------09:28----------
that is because if I get rejection I


---------09:35----------
pretty much fall back to Wow


---------09:37----------
or I fall back to games um and the fear


---------09:41----------
of rejection pretty much stops me from


---------09:44----------
putting my CV out there and that kind of


---------09:46----------
thing


---------09:47----------
and it just keeps me playing well say if


---------09:54----------
I go to a job interview I think I did


---------09:55----------
okay and then I don't hear back anything


---------09:58----------
at all then it's like you get that kind


---------10:01----------
of sinking feeling that you thought you


---------10:03----------
were doing well but you're not and then


---------10:05----------
it's the kind of just like to kick back


---------10:08----------
into the middle of the hole like you


---------10:09----------
climb your way out to actually stomach


---------10:11----------
it to actually go to the interview with


---------10:13----------
like pretty bad social anxiety so


---------10:16----------
stomach it to actually get out of my


---------10:18----------
house and go to the interview do the


---------10:21----------
interview and then not getting a reply


---------10:25----------
or anything that is kind of like a kick


---------10:26----------
in the face back to the hole back to 20


---------10:29----------
hours away all day yeah absolutely man I


---------10:33----------
mean okay so this is why I was kind of


---------10:35----------
confused cuz you say like you know


---------10:37----------
getting a job and working on your CV you


---------10:39----------
know it leads to something but what I'm


---------10:40----------
hearing from you is actually quite the


---------10:42----------
opposite I think what I'm hearing from


---------10:44----------
you is that like trying to do something


---------10:46----------
in the real world actually you know it's


---------10:48----------
gonna kick you back in the hole like


---------10:50----------
that's what you know the thing is I feel


---------10:53----------
like if I put more into it it might not


---------10:57----------
kick me back in the hole if I was able


---------10:59----------
to really I mean it sounds like you it


---------11:05----------
sounds like you you really have a lot


---------11:07----------
like you have these feelings of


---------11:09----------
rejection and fear of rejection sounds


---------11:11----------
like you what kind of feel socially


---------11:12----------
anxious and actually you're putting a


---------11:14----------
lot into it every time you go out for a


---------11:16----------
job interview


---------11:18----------
that's the thing I feel like I could be


---------11:20----------
doing it more like that's that's where I


---------11:22----------
think the addiction comes into place


---------11:23----------
because I I know that I could be doing


---------11:25----------
it more but it's just the question could


---------11:28----------
be doing what more putting more effort


---------11:30----------
into finding a job or any more effort


---------11:32----------
into that kind of thing


---------11:33----------
I mean I think that makes sense


---------11:36----------
theoretically but what I'm hearing from


---------11:39----------
you is like let's just think about this


---------11:40----------
for a second let's think about your


---------11:42----------
brain right yep so like your brain you


---------11:44----------
like overcome a lot of these like social


---------11:46----------
anxieties and fears of rejection and


---------11:48----------
then you go out into the world and you


---------11:50----------
apply for a job and what happens don't


---------11:54----------
get anything like no response so the


---------11:56----------
next time you apply for a job so you've


---------11:58----------
been rejected one more time right so


---------12:01----------
what happens to the fear of your


---------12:02----------
rejection every time you get rejected


---------12:05----------
it's theoretically I guess it would get


---------12:08----------
it feels like the social exciting things


---------12:10----------
like that getting easier but I don't


---------12:11----------
know no no forget about theoretically


---------12:14----------
well let's talk about you what happens


---------12:17----------
to your fear of rejection every time you


---------12:19----------
get rejected


---------12:20----------
jalaja absolutely right so let's think


---------12:24----------
about this because I don't think it gets


---------12:25----------
easier I think let's trust you let's


---------12:26----------
forget about theory ok because theory


---------12:28----------
leads us to stupid answers let's trust


---------12:31----------
you so like if I if I get on a horse and


---------12:40----------
the and I start riding the horse and the


---------12:43----------
horse throws me off and I break an arm


---------12:45----------
and then I get back on the horse again


---------12:48----------
and then I go riding and it throws me


---------12:50----------
off and I break a leg like what happens


---------12:53----------
to my fear of the horse every time the


---------12:54----------
horse tosses me off it's gonna go with


---------12:58----------
absolutely right and that's what it


---------12:59----------
feels like it doesn't get easier it


---------13:00----------
actually gets harder every time you get


---------13:02----------
rejected the sense of rejection grows


---------13:05----------
and so what is your brain gonna do if


---------13:09----------
you're getting rejected over and over


---------13:11----------
again and feeling bad about yourself


---------13:12----------
shut down and give into habits not give


---------13:16----------
into habits a very important Scott I


---------13:19----------
want you to realize this it's not giving


---------13:21----------
in to anything it's action


---------13:22----------
learning ruta rights giving in presumes


---------13:26----------
that like you're like it's failing does


---------13:29----------
that make sense giving in sounds like a


---------13:30----------
failure yeah but you're not actually


---------13:32----------
failing your brain is actually trying to


---------13:34----------
help you out it's succeeding it's


---------13:35----------
learning it's helping you by telling you


---------13:38----------
hey Scott don't apply for a [ __ ] job


---------13:41----------
because all you all it does is hurt you


---------13:43----------
it's almost like you have a an abusive


---------13:46----------
relationship with life and you're like


---------13:48----------
you know you're the person who keeps on


---------13:50----------
going back to their abusive partner even


---------13:52----------
though they get beat and your brain is


---------13:54----------
telling you that hey life is abusive


---------13:56----------
because every time you try to live life


---------13:58----------
what happens Scott get kicked absolutely


---------14:02----------
right because you brought it you get


---------14:03----------
kicked back in the hole so what do you


---------14:04----------
think about that it's really easy to


---------14:08----------
just play Wow all day absolutely and why


---------14:11----------
is it really easy to play Wow cuz it's a


---------14:13----------
really easy escape it's it's where I


---------14:16----------
feel I mean I escaped bad word good why


---------14:19----------
is it a bad word mmm because that kind


---------14:21----------
of makes it feel like I'm losing yes


---------14:23----------
yeah so it's not an escape what is it um


---------14:27----------
comfort sure yes yeah absolutely right


---------14:31----------
so I'd say it's almost like a strategy


---------14:33----------
to do what for you to just say


---------14:38----------
comfortable not put myself into any kind


---------14:41----------
of emotionally harming situations and


---------14:44----------
just stay where I'm comfortable and


---------14:47----------
happy yeah so I don't like the word


---------14:49----------
comfort because that too has a value


---------14:51----------
judgement right if someone decides to


---------14:53----------
stay comfortable we like judge them and


---------14:55----------
we say like oh you shouldn't put


---------14:57----------
yourself out push push for more yeah so


---------14:59----------
I like the word happy because I think


---------15:01----------
that's closer to the truth I also like


---------15:03----------
the word protects protect so it feels


---------15:06----------
protective to me it's like tanking like


---------15:09----------
gaming is the way that your brain tanks


---------15:11----------
the bad stuff in life yep what do you


---------15:15----------
think about that makes sense because it


---------15:18----------
kind of shelters me for everything else


---------15:20----------
which is what choice does sir absolutely


---------15:22----------
right and is that a bad thing I don't


---------15:27----------
necessarily think so why not because I


---------15:31----------
think everyone should have something


---------15:32----------
that tanks the kind of harmful things in


---------15:35----------
life for me


---------15:36----------
right now so what do we do about that


---------15:40----------
hey don't know I'll be honest I I'm not


---------15:46----------
really sure that's a great answer man


---------15:51----------
yeah I'm not so sure but I'm hoping we


---------15:54----------
can try to figure something out yeah


---------15:56----------
sure so I think the first thing to


---------15:58----------
understand is that I want you to stop


---------16:00----------
thinking about gaming as an addiction


---------16:03----------
okay because like an addiction is a


---------16:06----------
negative thing it's something that you


---------16:07----------
have to overcome and and what am I


---------16:09----------
trying to like when I'm walking you to


---------16:11----------
interpret things in a particular way


---------16:13----------
like what am I trying to do like how am


---------16:15----------
i pushing you towards like thinking


---------16:17----------
about gaming as it is like a I don't


---------16:23----------
know that it's a healthy thing that it's


---------16:25----------
that it is good for me at the moment but


---------16:28----------
I mean I yeah I don't think you vested


---------16:30----------
abnormal but I think for me it's a good


---------16:32----------
thing at the moment yeah so so I think


---------16:34----------
healthy and good for you also imply


---------16:37----------
certain value judgments right so I don't


---------16:39----------
think that your gaming is healthy I


---------16:41----------
think it is protective protectors Yeah


---------16:43----------
right so so I think that a lot of the


---------16:45----------
stuff that you said in terms of sort of


---------16:46----------
being behind in life and stuff like that


---------16:49----------
I think all that stuff makes sense I


---------16:50----------
think you should play less than 18 to 20


---------16:53----------
hours of Wow a day and I also think that


---------16:57----------
you don't play just because you're


---------16:59----------
addicted I think you play because your


---------17:01----------
brain has two options it's kind of like


---------17:05----------
we can do this one thing that leads to


---------17:07----------
uncertain like progress which is like


---------17:10----------
apply for a job and work on our CV


---------17:12----------
because you say that you know that's


---------17:13----------
gonna make your future better I don't


---------17:15----------
think your brain understands that and I


---------17:17----------
don't because I don't think that that's


---------17:18----------
fair because what has your CV done for


---------17:21----------
you Scott


---------17:22----------
we've proved us nothing this right so


---------17:25----------
then here's the thing your brain is


---------17:26----------
smart your brain is working for you and


---------17:29----------
so your brain is like Scott why the [ __ ]


---------17:31----------
are we working on this CV it's never


---------17:33----------
gotten you anything instead we've got


---------17:35----------
this other thing that gives you


---------17:37----------
happiness accomplishment and feeling


---------17:39----------
whole like why would you ever want to


---------17:42----------
work on your CV when you can get all of


---------17:45----------
those things here and all your CV ever


---------17:47----------
gets you is


---------17:49----------
more sadness exactly yeah so it's not an


---------17:54----------
addiction it's actually a protective


---------17:55----------
mechanism what is that big sigh what do


---------17:57----------
you think yeah I just just like a


---------17:59----------
realization thing because it doesn't


---------18:00----------
make sense like because it's like I feel


---------18:04----------
like a lot of people aren't necessarily


---------18:05----------
happy with their jobs but they do it


---------18:06----------
because they know that they have to and


---------18:08----------
like I'm in a pretty little fortress


---------18:10----------
situation where I don't really


---------18:11----------
necessarily need income right now so


---------18:13----------
it's I feel like I'm lucky but I feel


---------18:15----------
like I could be doing better which is


---------18:16----------
the sigh I think but it's yeah just I


---------18:19----------
realize I should say I guess yeah that


---------18:21----------
you could be doing better what does that


---------18:24----------
mean um I mean I could be living


---------18:29----------
independently I could be getting income


---------18:32----------
buying a things that I want that kind of


---------18:35----------
thing I guess sure you couldn't be doing


---------18:37----------
better what is your brain how does your


---------18:38----------
brain feel about that it wants to play


---------18:41----------
Wow feel about doing better um anxious I


---------18:49----------
guess like cuz it obviously the thought


---------18:54----------
of doing better obviously means I'm


---------18:55----------
striving to actually better myself which


---------18:57----------
in itself makes me feel quite anxious


---------18:59----------
does your brain care about bettering


---------19:01----------
yourself


---------19:02----------
um I guess directly not but that's


---------19:07----------
correct


---------19:08----------
brain doesn't give a [ __ ] doesn't and


---------19:11----------
bettering yourself that's your mind


---------19:13----------
those are your intentions but the brain


---------19:16----------
is like like if you think about it like


---------19:19----------
that's why we have to fight against


---------19:20----------
ourselves like when we exercise right


---------19:22----------
every if you go out and you try to


---------19:23----------
exercise your brain is like what what


---------19:26----------
are we doing well yeah this is fabulous


---------19:28----------
[ __ ] yeah yeah like you're just you're


---------19:31----------
running but there's no reason to run


---------19:32----------
there's no there's no purpose so our


---------19:35----------
brain is kind of the idea bettering


---------19:38----------
yourself is not something there's no


---------19:39----------
like neuroscience circuit about


---------19:41----------
bettering yourself there is a circuit


---------19:42----------
around progress right and the tricky


---------19:45----------
thing is that we have a circuit that and


---------19:48----------
the problem is that part of our brain


---------19:49----------
can't tell the difference between


---------19:51----------
progress in the real world and progress


---------19:53----------
in a virtual world right right so like


---------19:56----------
you could also argue that if you trade


---------19:58----------
stocks during the day and you see a


---------20:01----------
number on a computer screen go


---------20:03----------
we can think of that as progress but the


---------20:06----------
stimulus for the brain is exactly the


---------20:07----------
same whether you're seeing the honor go


---------20:09----------
up or the number and your bank account


---------20:10----------
go up in that moment does that make


---------20:12----------
sense yeah it is just a number on a


---------20:14----------
screen both of that are just a number on


---------20:16----------
a screen we tend to as a society at


---------20:19----------
attribute more value to one than the


---------20:21----------
other and I don't think that that's a


---------20:22----------
mistake but our brain is just like hey


---------20:24----------
we're doing better and that's a very


---------20:26----------
very deeply wired circuit of our brain


---------20:28----------
that sort of if you think about it like


---------20:30----------
you know kids fall and then they get


---------20:33----------
back up and they walk again yeah and


---------20:35----------
they keep on failing over and over and


---------20:37----------
over again but it's that that sort of


---------20:39----------
strive it's something called intent to


---------20:40----------
mastery so we all have this baked in


---------20:43----------
part of our brain that kind of like


---------20:44----------
tries to get better at stuff and wants


---------20:48----------
to see progress and it doesn't care


---------20:50----------
whether it's learning how to throw a


---------20:51----------
ball or standing up and walking or you


---------20:55----------
know grinding on other pitous yeah yeah


---------20:57----------
yeah yeah so I mean where does the sense


---------21:00----------
of better come from tell me about that


---------21:02----------
meaning like doing better and life oh


---------21:05----------
yeah like why do you want to do better


---------21:09----------
because I don't wanna be a dropkick my


---------21:11----------
life pretty much I don't want to miss


---------21:14----------
like sorry just does nothing like living


---------21:17----------
on like social benefits and stuff like


---------21:19----------
that I guess like I don't want to be I


---------21:23----------
want to study I want to raise a family I


---------21:27----------
want to provide I want to do all those


---------21:29----------
things so that I can I don't know if


---------21:32----------
it's like leave a mark on the world or


---------21:33----------
whatever it is but like I want to do


---------21:35----------
something that's like actually means


---------21:37----------
something rather than just does that


---------21:39----------
mean in like a I guess like


---------21:51----------
to provide like I don't know I want


---------21:55----------
there to be someone who actually


---------21:57----------
understood like this person did


---------21:59----------
something or like I don't know why that


---------22:00----------
is I don't know if that's like a deeply


---------22:02----------
lodged thing in people's brains but it's


---------22:04----------
something that I want to do I want to


---------22:06----------
like have my kids know that they had


---------22:07----------
like a dad who cared for them and wanted


---------22:10----------
to do something that's like I'm like


---------22:11----------
actually want to do things I guess so


---------22:13----------
what is it that you want can you say


---------22:15----------
that again uh to have people be proud of


---------22:18----------
me I guess


---------22:20----------
ya can't just think for a second yeah of


---------22:28----------
course so I just want to point something


---------22:32----------
out so I think there's a difference


---------22:34----------
between what you want and the ways in


---------22:38----------
which your mind comes up with fulfilling


---------22:43----------
that want so you said something about


---------22:45----------
having a family and and being successful


---------22:48----------
and and having a job and stuff like that


---------22:50----------
you said that these are all the things


---------22:51----------
that you want that's what you mean by


---------22:53----------
better because I was asking about it


---------22:54----------
better but what I think the really core


---------22:56----------
of I think those are all pictures of


---------23:00----------
this sense of being proud does that make


---------23:04----------
sense I think what you really want is


---------23:06----------
for people to look at you and say like


---------23:08----------
hey that's a that's an awesome person


---------23:11----------
yeah and if we think about it you know


---------23:15----------
when you think about what games protect


---------23:16----------
you from what is the main thing that


---------23:18----------
they protect you from kind of mentioned


---------23:22----------
the word a couple of times there's one


---------23:23----------
word that sadness from what drives you


---------23:30----------
into games more than anything else


---------23:33----------
happiness what negative thing what what


---------23:37----------
what let me put it this way what is what


---------23:39----------
our games tanking from like what are


---------23:41----------
they taking damage the real world uh I


---------23:46----------
favor the word I used


---------23:47----------
yeah so I mean I mentioned rejection


---------23:49----------
several times oh yeah right so like for


---------23:52----------
me the thing that seems to float to the


---------23:53----------
surface out of everything you've said is


---------23:55----------
rejection yeah what do you think is that


---------23:57----------
the main thing that they tank yeah yeah


---------24:00----------
okay pretty much so what do you think is


---------24:01----------
the relationship between wanting


---------24:04----------
people to be proud of you and rejection


---------24:07----------
if any are those two things connected I


---------24:11----------
feel like most people will go through


---------24:13----------
rejection of my life and that they'll


---------24:15----------
you kind of just have to tank through it


---------24:18----------
and that I don't know feels like


---------24:22----------
directly connected though okay fair


---------24:25----------
enough yeah okay so let's think through


---------24:32----------
this right so you have to tank through


---------24:34----------
it but games tank rejection right yeah


---------24:38----------
and as long as that rejection is there


---------24:40----------
and it's big you're gonna need to take


---------24:43----------
it so there are two things that you can


---------24:45----------
do you can tank damage or you can do


---------24:47----------
what do damage you can do damage


---------24:50----------
absolutely yeah or so if you're a rogue


---------24:55----------
right and Wow and you're in a raid the


---------24:58----------
the main tank serves as protecting you


---------25:01----------
from damage what's the other like


---------25:02----------
critical role that we're missing feeling


---------25:05----------
absolutely yeah so I think that gaming


---------25:08----------
serves as a tank but the question is


---------25:10----------
like like where is the healing in your


---------25:13----------
life right so if we think about the fear


---------25:16----------
of rejection is that which keeps you


---------25:18----------
into the game playing the game yeah and


---------25:21----------
the more that we kind of like the more


---------25:23----------
you're afraid of rejection the more you


---------25:25----------
need your tank and tanking is the game


---------25:27----------
you're the DPS like what are we missing


---------25:29----------
healer like what heals so what is it


---------25:33----------
that needs to be healed


---------25:37----------
I guess the damage that comes through


---------25:40----------
because of the rejection absolutely


---------25:42----------
right so now our question becomes when


---------25:45----------
was the first time you were kicked into


---------25:47----------
the pit probably right after high school


---------25:52----------
tell me about that I pretty much I


---------25:57----------
finished high school and I pretty much


---------26:00----------
did it nothing for a while like I didn't


---------26:04----------
really know what to get into so I was


---------26:06----------
just really down and just didn't really


---------26:08----------
know what to do with anything and then I


---------26:12----------
was found a couple games to play that


---------26:13----------
obviously filled the void and then it


---------26:15----------
was it was really hard to get out of


---------26:17----------
that pit of


---------26:18----------
playing games and being can I just


---------26:21----------
interrupt you for a second


---------26:22----------
yeah so use the phrase filling the void


---------26:25----------
yeah that implies to me like healing


---------26:29----------
right that that implies you're fixing if


---------26:32----------
I've got a pet and I fill it in the pit


---------26:34----------
is no longer there


---------26:34----------
I don't think games filled in the voyage


---------26:37----------
right


---------26:38----------
I think they boarded it up a little bit


---------26:40----------
there yeah right tap stuff a bit sorry


---------26:44----------
for interrupting you but I think that no


---------26:46----------
that's it's a distinction to the notice


---------26:48----------
catch yeah


---------26:52----------
yeah so it sounds like you said that you


---------26:54----------
were you weren't really sure what you


---------26:56----------
were doing after high school can you


---------26:58----------
tell us a little bit yeah and anyone


---------27:01----------
it's like a kinda like an IT course but


---------27:04----------
I feel like I only really went into an


---------27:06----------
IT course cuz I think it's like I think


---------27:08----------
it's this really common if people who


---------27:09----------
liked games just go into IT even though


---------27:11----------
I don't have like I don't have like a


---------27:13----------
whole lot of interest in it sure like


---------27:14----------
it's just like a I think it's just a


---------27:16----------
thing that's real common yes


---------27:19----------
Scott let me just hypothesize with you


---------27:21----------
for a second so you know if you say that


---------27:23----------
you finished high school and you felt


---------27:24----------
pretty directionless that may have been


---------27:27----------
when you got knocked into the pit but I


---------27:29----------
think the pit started getting dug way


---------27:30----------
before that probably does that make


---------27:33----------
sense so - well tell me a little bit


---------27:35----------
about like do you remember times in your


---------27:36----------
life like before you finished high


---------27:38----------
school where you kind of were rejected


---------27:40----------
or you dealt with rejection absolutely


---------27:43----------
yeah through high school because we


---------27:49----------
moved to this country from I moved from


---------27:50----------
England when I was pretty young and I've


---------27:53----------
pretty much always had an issue with


---------27:54----------
allergies and I have like eczema and


---------27:56----------
like pretty bad expects me through high


---------27:59----------
school and I don't know if I was like a


---------28:01----------
stress through school but it was always


---------28:02----------
like really really really bad like I'd


---------28:05----------
go to school like with just bad x-bow of


---------28:08----------
my face and things like that so I think


---------28:10----------
I don't know like how would it be


---------28:15----------
connected I guess it was just like a


---------28:17----------
when I come I was just excited to come


---------28:19----------
home and just play games cuz in games I


---------28:22----------
was felt comfortable well protected from


---------28:24----------
not having to show my face and things


---------28:27----------
like that I guess yeah go yeah so let's


---------28:30----------
take a step back from analyze


---------28:32----------
so let's just understand so tell me


---------28:34----------
about when when did you move from the UK


---------28:36----------
to you're in the US or what I'm in New


---------28:39----------
Zealand oh your news okay so yeah so


---------28:41----------
tell me when did you move to New Zealand


---------28:43----------
how old were you I think I was about 11


---------28:46----------
okay and what was what do you remember


---------28:49----------
about growing up in England


---------28:50----------
um not a whole lot um pretty much like


---------28:56----------
through England houses school family I


---------28:59----------
had like two friends in England that I


---------29:01----------
would like go to the house and things


---------29:03----------
like that I'm just just off after school


---------29:04----------
- but what was what was home like for


---------29:06----------
you when you were growing up um


---------29:09----------
busy like it was pretty much almost one


---------29:12----------
parent was working one was home and it


---------29:13----------
was kind of shifted in and out but my


---------29:17----------
sister's a big gamer what a mess this is


---------29:18----------
a big game and the other one stop how


---------29:20----------
many my dad was a big gamer zone - okay


---------29:23----------
older younger both older I'm the


---------29:26----------
youngest okay and what was it like do


---------29:31----------
you remember what it was like being a


---------29:32----------
kid with your sisters at no like in


---------29:34----------
England um I don't have like too many


---------29:38----------
like crazy memories I guess not -


---------29:40----------
nothing really like pops out I was like


---------29:42----------
a distinctive thing were you guys close


---------29:43----------
um yeah yeah it kind of shifted between


---------29:47----------
the two of them I was always closer to


---------29:48----------
one than the other I guess I don't know


---------29:49----------
why that was but yeah


---------29:51----------
you said your dad was a gamer yeah yeah


---------29:54----------
my dad used to play a lot of games where


---------29:57----------
he's like oh well he passed away last


---------29:59----------
year


---------30:00----------
so I'm sorry to hear that yeah but he


---------30:03----------
got me into like a lot of games like he


---------30:05----------
got me into like a lot of the RPGs that


---------30:08----------
I grew up with the kind of fantasy and


---------30:10----------
stuff like that and I think he also got


---------30:12----------
me into a while like when we were like


---------30:16----------
our first computer when we moved here


---------30:17----------
and had a friend that played while at


---------30:18----------
school and it was yeah pretty much


---------30:20----------
started from there what's it like


---------30:23----------
talking about this um it's okay I kind


---------30:27----------
of I don't think I was like crazy close


---------30:29----------
with my dad like just as a whole but


---------30:34----------
talking about it feels okay I guess I


---------30:37----------
kind of come to terms of that I think


---------30:38----------
come to terms with what just his passing


---------30:42----------
and talking about it as okay I don't


---------30:44----------
really tell people I don't


---------30:46----------
I've never really talked people like


---------30:47----------
one-on-one I'm from like one or two


---------30:48----------
friends just cuz I don't know I don't


---------30:52----------
really like I don't know if it's like a


---------30:54----------
selfish thing but I don't like ten a a


---------30:56----------
conversation like all on me or like


---------30:58----------
making people feel uncomfortable because


---------31:00----------
I know that that kind of thing can make


---------31:02----------
people feel uncomfortable I guess do you


---------31:09----------
feel like you're burdening other people


---------31:11----------
by talking about your dad yeah yeah I


---------31:14----------
feel like if it's like I don't know I'm


---------31:16----------
never gonna bring it up unless it's like


---------31:18----------
topic like the other time I told the


---------31:20----------
only time I float like one of my really


---------31:21----------
close friends was because we were going


---------31:23----------
to another funeral and until then he


---------31:25----------
didn't know I'm gonna just think a


---------31:31----------
second okay yeah yeah of course of


---------31:32----------
course


---------31:43----------
what's wrong with burdening other people


---------31:47----------
um I guess I don't want to unnecessarily


---------31:54----------
cause like I don't want to say like


---------31:57----------
unhappiness but I don't want to like


---------31:58----------
unnecessarily a shift a mood of like a


---------32:01----------
room or something like that so unless


---------32:03----------
it's like a topical thing I don't really


---------32:04----------
want to just bring it up


---------32:08----------
I just I feel like it can like if every


---------32:14----------
was having a good mood or like


---------32:15----------
everyone's just like completely contain


---------32:16----------
or anything like that I don't feel a


---------32:18----------
need to bring it up I guess do you miss


---------32:20----------
your dad um yeah from time to time it's


---------32:25----------
not like good


---------32:26----------
not particularly um we had like a lot of


---------32:29----------
arguments - yeah cuz he he was one of


---------32:31----------
the people like really struggling or


---------32:32----------
like kind of get her drop on things like


---------32:34----------
that but I obviously I'd miss him but


---------32:38----------
it's not like yeah how did he make you


---------32:44----------
feel when tell about those arguments um


---------32:47----------
I had shifted from different things like


---------32:50----------
multiple things like waking up past 12


---------32:52----------
o'clock because I have to play till like


---------32:55----------
3 o'clock because that's when the keys


---------32:56----------
were there I was something like that


---------32:59----------
we were talking about after high school


---------33:01----------
um oh no that was recent that was like


---------33:03----------
pretty much a couple of months before I


---------33:05----------
passed I guess okay um and then after


---------33:10----------
high schools kind of just get a job no


---------33:13----------
get a job no funny thing I guess hmm I'm


---------33:18----------
trying and then it was get a job


---------33:20----------
I'm trying what were things like between


---------33:22----------
you and him during high school um for


---------33:26----------
the most part they were okay like it was


---------33:28----------
kind of just yeah there's the haggis


---------33:31----------
same with it was like the same


---------33:32----------
relationship I have with my mom which


---------33:34----------
was like fine good oh yeah was it good


---------33:41----------
I'd say yeah they're like cuz he was


---------33:44----------
like a bit of an alcoholic like so


---------33:48----------
tippy time so it was a little bit shifty


---------33:50----------
but as a general thing it was good like


---------33:53----------
I never like resented him or anything


---------33:55----------
like that


---------33:56----------
I mean there's a difference between fine


---------34:01----------
and God


---------34:01----------
oh yeah of course so I'm hearing from


---------34:05----------
you is that it was okay yeah yeah pretty


---------34:08----------
much it was okay like like it sounds bad


---------34:13----------
to say tolerate but kinda one of the


---------34:14----------
words that pops up I guess yeah


---------34:16----------
what were you tolerating um just the


---------34:21----------
fact that he would come home drunk and


---------34:24----------
be it would be really uncomfortable like


---------34:26----------
I'm not very good around drunk people


---------34:27----------
but I think that might stem from that I


---------34:30----------
mean how old were you when he would come


---------34:33----------
home drunk pretty much all the way from


---------34:36----------
like 14 to like 21 okay do you know any


---------34:42----------
14-year olds that are quote unquote good


---------34:44----------
at handling drunk people yeah I guess


---------34:46----------
not I guess it's not really something


---------34:48----------
you can just pick up as a skill okay


---------34:50----------
yeah I mean I'm sorry did they not teach


---------34:52----------
that to you along with history and


---------34:54----------
dinosaur I guess I must have missed his


---------34:56----------
class yeah so so you said 14 what


---------35:01----------
changed when you were 14 why did he


---------35:02----------
start coming home drunk then um I guess


---------35:05----------
that's just kind of like an early


---------35:06----------
recollection but I guess he would


---------35:08----------
probably come home around like 11


---------35:10----------
o'clock and I'd probably be in bed


---------35:12----------
before that before sweating so I was


---------35:14----------
kind of early recollection would you say


---------35:17----------
that you were happy growing up in


---------35:18----------
England


---------35:19----------
um content and I really have like too


---------35:25----------
many memories of England I guess it's


---------35:27----------
kind of just about it's all here like no


---------35:28----------
just together kind of a blur I guess


---------35:30----------
yeah from ginger and everyone else yeah


---------35:32----------
yeah does anything in particular pop out


---------35:36----------
in terms of memories you have any strong


---------35:38----------
memories from before you move to New


---------35:39----------
Zealand it's a bit like a lot of


---------35:43----------
football and like a soccer and they


---------35:46----------
still are quite good so I guess have


---------35:48----------
memories of that Jam how did it feel I'm


---------35:50----------
good at football yeah I loved it like


---------35:53----------
I've always been a very competitive


---------35:54----------
person so it's like I think that's why


---------35:56----------
my guy loved games as well sure but yeah


---------35:59----------
do you still play football not as much


---------36:03----------
as I'd like to but yeah I'll like your


---------36:06----------
grandma's like my niece and stuff like


---------36:07----------
that oh you have a nice yes oh this is


---------36:10----------
sir


---------36:10----------
has two kids how old are your kids or


---------36:13----------
nephew oldest niece oh yeah oldest is


---------36:18----------
seven I think and nephew is two and a


---------36:22----------
half I think how's your relationship


---------36:24----------
with them um pretty good obviously my


---------36:28----------
nephew like every time I say me six


---------36:30----------
screaming was happy um


---------36:31----------
salmon that nice basically what do they


---------36:34----------
call you uh scat scat scat II I don't


---------36:40----------
know why the reason I ask is because


---------36:43----------
kids usually have weird names for yeah


---------36:45----------
yeah yeah yeah interesting and so what


---------36:53----------
was life for you after you moved to New


---------36:55----------
Zealand I don't really know when did you


---------37:02----------
start um pretty much as soon as I moved


---------37:05----------
here just because could when he compared


---------37:07----------
English to New Zealand one of the


---------37:08----------
biggest things you see a scenery as


---------37:10----------
trees and I have like real bad hay fever


---------37:12----------
so it got real bad like I got like a


---------37:15----------
really bad eyes like why I asked you


---------37:16----------
like really bloodshot and like puffy and


---------37:18----------
stuff like that so I was always like


---------37:20----------
real nervous going to school at first


---------37:21----------
cuz what were you nervous about


---------37:25----------
just like appearance like cuz it would


---------37:28----------
get really bad


---------37:29----------
x2 I get really bad and then I just like


---------37:30----------
wouldn't really want to go out because I


---------37:32----------
felt like I look like a puffy mess


---------37:35----------
mm-hmm


---------37:37----------
I can sympathize with the feeling of


---------37:39----------
puffy mess because I had eczema and I


---------37:41----------
still have allergies everything's just


---------37:45----------
swollen yeah yeah puffy mess is actually


---------37:48----------
a great way to describe it yeah and did


---------37:51----------
people ever comment about your skin or


---------37:54----------
your puffiness er um no but I was like


---------37:58----------
really new to England like when I was in


---------38:01----------
like like primary school like promise


---------38:03----------
when I first moved to not really my


---------38:06----------
double take a couple cases of bullying


---------38:07----------
through like maybe like 13 or 14 and


---------38:10----------
then again like mmm


---------38:13----------
early midway through high school can you


---------38:15----------
tell me about 13 14 yes it's kind of


---------38:23----------
this doing school


---------38:26----------
football and I don't know kind of bad


---------38:32----------
with that kind of memory stuff I guess


---------38:34----------
but what do you remember yeah about


---------38:37----------
being bullied her I just remember like a


---------38:42----------
couple of moments of being bullied just


---------38:43----------
like I heard like I'm called alien and


---------38:46----------
stuff like that which was there yeah


---------38:49----------
pretty weird but wise cuz the ala do


---------38:57----------
stuff oh well yeah I don't really have


---------39:04----------
like too many recollections of them that


---------39:05----------
but really sure and then what about when


---------39:08----------
you were a little bit older I had


---------39:14----------
surgery a few times like cuz I've got I


---------39:17----------
like pretty bad kidney as well just like


---------39:20----------
a couple of health issues and I remember


---------39:23----------
one time I was hospital for quite a


---------39:24----------
while and I came out and I was a little


---------39:27----------
bit chunky and next one was bad I just


---------39:31----------
kind of got belief like oh stuff as well


---------39:32----------
so kind of status with the mix do you


---------39:36----------
remember how they made you feel bad that


---------39:40----------
early yeah I don't really remember like


---------39:42----------
what they'd say anything like that but


---------39:43----------
yeah wonderfully avoided like like


---------39:46----------
certain parts of the school because I


---------39:47----------
knew people around there hey how can we


---------39:50----------
add a little bit more color or depth to


---------39:53----------
the way that they made you feel what do


---------39:57----------
you mean sorry


---------39:58----------
so you say they made you feel bad yeah


---------40:01----------
something more descriptive yeah we don't


---------40:05----------
have to talk about the scene tell me


---------40:06----------
about what if you can tell me what the


---------40:10----------
feeling was like I mean the biggest


---------40:11----------
things like outcasted I guess play I was


---------40:14----------
definitely outcast for like a certain


---------40:15----------
group of people because I don't know


---------40:17----------
like obviously high school people hang


---------40:19----------
out in groups do you feel like an


---------40:20----------
outcast throw out some of the early as a


---------40:24----------
high school I did and then max but


---------40:28----------
started getting a little bit better


---------40:28----------
instead of getting a bit more confidence


---------40:30----------
and realizing that there was other


---------40:32----------
people who played Yan's a lot so it was


---------40:33----------
kind of like his hangover those people


---------40:35----------
okay but earlier you found your people


---------40:38----------
you found us yeah exactly yeah yeah I


---------40:47----------
mean I'm just wondering you know would


---------40:49----------
you say that because I when I think


---------40:50----------
about outcasted um you know it's it's an


---------40:53----------
it's an interesting verb it's not a verb


---------40:56----------
that I hear very much and you know not


---------40:59----------
to not to be a little bit too Freudian


---------41:01----------
for you but I wonder if rejected would


---------41:03----------
be a similar word yeah yeah yeah yeah it


---------41:05----------
would be some of them fresh feels the


---------41:07----------
same way I guess yeah like what feels


---------41:09----------
the same


---------41:11----------
just like the usage of the word like


---------41:12----------
I'll cast it rejected like it's yeah


---------41:15----------
let me ask you something when you go to


---------41:17----------
let's say you apply for a job when it's


---------41:19----------
last time you applied for a job three


---------41:24----------
weeks ago


---------41:24----------
okay and have you heard back no dude is


---------41:30----------
the feeling when you think about that or


---------41:32----------
when I ask that question even that no is


---------41:34----------
not a regular no right no the feeling


---------41:39----------
that you have is that do you does it


---------41:41----------
does it smell or taste like what used to


---------41:44----------
feel like when kids would comment about


---------41:45----------
when they would call you an alien or I


---------41:49----------
feel like it's a little bit different


---------41:50----------
because them denied me a job isn't like


---------41:54----------
a hateful thing like I don't take it


---------41:56----------
personally sure it's just like a there


---------41:58----------
was someone better or something else


---------42:01----------
happened which is like perfectly fine


---------42:02----------
like is that cool yeah like if I didn't


---------42:08----------
get the job it means someone else did


---------42:10----------
which means there's probably someone


---------42:11----------
there was just more applicable or better


---------42:13----------
which is okay but like the whole


---------42:15----------
Highfill comments and I was like that


---------42:17----------
was like a direct thing that was to me


---------42:20----------
it's true they feel very different okay


---------42:23----------
so that that's very helpful for me to


---------42:25----------
know thank you for sharing that so let


---------42:27----------
me ask you something you know if


---------42:29----------
someone's if there was just a better


---------42:30----------
candidate out there being told no


---------42:33----------
indirectly yes so it still feels like


---------42:35----------
I'm not good enough for being rejected I


---------42:38----------
seem so so so one is not being good


---------42:41----------
enough one is being persecuted or


---------42:43----------
attacked yeah yeah exactly yeah do you


---------42:47----------
remember if there's anything that


---------42:48----------
happened to you that made you feel not


---------42:50----------
good enough growing up


---------42:53----------
um I can't think of anything in


---------43:00----------
particular


---------43:01----------
sure can you tell me about what it was


---------43:03----------
like when your dad would come home drunk


---------43:05----------
uh hi to my room it's like for the most


---------43:10----------
part like if I was on the computer like


---------43:11----------
I knew I would duck away before like


---------43:13----------
10:30 and it aside to my room play my


---------43:15----------
phone on something all hot a console cuz


---------43:18----------
we had a computer like family room


---------43:22----------
because it was just uncomfortable being


---------43:27----------
in the same room isn't basically like I


---------43:29----------
was I couldn't tolerate it like I would


---------43:31----------
just hide away what made it difficult


---------43:34----------
for you to tolerate he was obviously


---------43:39----------
they weren't not themselves when they're


---------43:40----------
drunk like I I've always just like that


---------43:43----------
like they'll be a lot louder a lot I


---------43:48----------
guess just him a particular was like a


---------43:50----------
lot louder it was asking I don't know


---------43:55----------
it's like a snare comfortable questions


---------43:56----------
I don't really remember any in


---------43:57----------
particular but I just remember I was


---------43:59----------
feeling very uncomfortable if I was in


---------44:00----------
the room I guess mm-hmm but can't think


---------44:05----------
of any super in particular ones I guess


---------44:10----------
I'm trying to get a sense of so I mean


---------44:16----------
I'm trying to understand what what it


---------44:19----------
was that made you uncomfortable like it


---------44:20----------
makes perfect sense to me that you were


---------44:22----------
uncomfortable yeah because you know 14


---------44:24----------
year-olds tend to be uncomfortable


---------44:25----------
around drunk people yeah what was it


---------44:29----------
right so some people will be judgmental


---------44:33----------
yeah I guess that's I guess it can be


---------44:36----------
things like that like he would like come


---------44:39----------
in and just like it's just like a little


---------44:42----------
comment like they'd say oh just like a


---------44:43----------
little comment like shouldn't you be in


---------44:44----------
bed why you still playing the games you


---------44:45----------
play the games too much kind of thing I


---------44:47----------
guess those kind of things would kind of


---------44:49----------
just make me think I don't even want to


---------44:52----------
talk about this I'm just gonna go mm-hmm


---------44:54----------
so let me ask you something Scott you


---------44:58----------
know when someone comments something


---------45:00----------
like that what how do you think that so


---------45:01----------
if I have you know if I told my kid


---------45:03----------
shouldn't you be doing this shouldn't


---------45:04----------
you be doing


---------45:05----------
how do you do that that that what


---------45:07----------
emotions do you think that my kid would


---------45:10----------
be feeling if I ask those kinds of


---------45:11----------
questions it feels like you're not


---------45:15----------
matter I want to say like accepting them


---------45:17----------
from what the they are role what they're


---------45:19----------
doing I guess sure would you say that it


---------45:21----------
would make them feel like they're not


---------45:22----------
good enough yeah yeah is that how your


---------45:25----------
dad made you feel sometimes yeah like


---------45:32----------
like when I cuz he was like a big


---------45:34----------
football player as well


---------45:35----------
well like loved he was like big into me


---------45:37----------
play football zone so like when I kind


---------45:40----------
of stopped because set it overseas like


---------45:42----------
big day on Wow usually and like just fun


---------45:45----------
to do stuff like with your school


---------45:46----------
friends play league with school friends


---------45:47----------
and stuff like that so like when I


---------45:49----------
didn't want to go to like all the


---------45:50----------
trainings and like old matches he wasn't


---------45:54----------
particularly happy about that


---------45:55----------
I don't remember like a specific


---------45:58----------
argument or anything about it but I do


---------45:59----------
remember like a bit of not


---------46:02----------
supportiveness


---------46:03----------
this little word but yeah yeah so I mean


---------46:07----------
I like it when people use things that


---------46:09----------
are not real words that actually gets


---------46:12----------
closer to an authentic oh yeah what that


---------46:15----------
tells me is that you're feeling


---------46:17----------
something that you don't have words to


---------46:19----------
describe but you're trying to create


---------46:21----------
words to capture the feeling yeah so not


---------46:26----------
supportiveness so it sounds like there


---------46:27----------
were kind of two things one is so it


---------46:30----------
sounds like your dad was pretty


---------46:31----------
judgmental I'd say so yeah


---------46:34----------
yeah and and generally speaking I think


---------46:36----------
one of the effects of being Chuck you


---------46:38----------
know judgemental is that you make people


---------46:40----------
feel like they're not good enough


---------46:42----------
yeah does that make sense yeah is that


---------46:45----------
is that closer to the way that you feel


---------46:48----------
in terms of when you apply to a job like


---------46:51----------
we talked a little bit about bullying


---------46:52----------
and persecutor yeah might feel the same


---------46:54----------
it feels it feels a little more closer


---------46:56----------
to like direct bolt-on


---------46:58----------
I guess because it's like the two things


---------47:00----------
kind of correlate with not being good


---------47:01----------
enough Oh interesting so you're saying


---------47:04----------
that your dad the the flavor of the


---------47:06----------
feeling that your dad evoked is actually


---------47:09----------
similar to bullying oh no it's more


---------47:12----------
similar to denial of a job oh it's more


---------47:15----------
so okay yeah I was


---------47:18----------
because it sounds absolutely better that


---------47:20----------
bad so have you watched our streams


---------47:22----------
before yeah look pretty much all of them


---------47:24----------
okay so do you know where to some scar


---------47:26----------
is Ike I remember the descriptive word


---------47:29----------
but I kind of have it in my brain what's


---------47:32----------
in your brain you I get all of them kind


---------47:36----------
of mixed up sure like some Scott dama


---------47:39----------
things like that no problem description


---------47:42----------
prisoner my best what am i digging for


---------47:46----------
you get the sense I'm digging a little


---------47:49----------
bit I'm not sure I'm particular like


---------47:59----------
what it is exactly that you're digging


---------48:00----------
before okay I can tell you looking for


---------48:03----------
something though yeah yeah so let me let


---------48:06----------
me just be a little bit more transparent


---------48:08----------
Oh root of the problem sure yeah and


---------48:13----------
what do you think about that do you


---------48:15----------
think there is a root I mean I'd say so


---------48:19----------
it might be like a collective of things


---------48:20----------
but I'd say yeah what do you think is in


---------48:23----------
that collective being denied at multiple


---------48:27----------
things or like yeah not being was to it


---------48:32----------
rejected there multiple things I guess


---------48:34----------
that have just led to a whole bunch of


---------48:37----------
covering myself hooked with like


---------48:39----------
catching myself up with like a bunch of


---------48:41----------
like games and stuff like that I guess


---------48:42----------
sure is there any rejection that you


---------48:44----------
felt that is particularly painful I


---------48:52----------
don't really think so I don't think


---------48:54----------
there was like one in particular that


---------48:55----------
like you know broke everything yeah but


---------48:58----------
I'm getting that sense as well yeah so


---------49:01----------
you know sometimes when when I talked to


---------49:04----------
people we find sort of like a root of a


---------49:06----------
problem and we're able to kind of like


---------49:08----------
notice that and evoke it and then


---------49:10----------
oftentimes they have a very like


---------49:11----------
emotional response on the stream is that


---------49:14----------
something that you're looking for hoping


---------49:17----------
for not really I also just want to


---------49:22----------
understand sure I think so I don't what


---------49:26----------
I'm getting the sense is that just like


---------49:27----------
you said I don't think you have one


---------49:29----------
thing I think you've got


---------49:32----------
a lot of little things yeah and you know


---------49:35----------
if we think a little bit about tanking


---------49:37----------
versus healing I think you've got a


---------49:39----------
couple of things you just think about


---------49:43----------
this for a second so I think there are a


---------49:45----------
couple of things going on so the first


---------49:47----------
is that gaming is sort of the board's


---------49:48----------
above the pit yeah right but the pit got


---------49:52----------
there somehow to begin with no so


---------49:54----------
generally speaking I don't know how else


---------49:56----------
to describe this but I'd say about 30 to


---------49:59----------
40 percent of gamers who I've worked


---------50:00----------
with actually had an alcoholic problem


---------50:02----------
alcoholic parent I don't know exactly


---------50:05----------
how that relates and I think it's I also


---------50:08----------
don't think I mean I don't


---------50:09----------
did your dad just suddenly develop a


---------50:11----------
drinking problem when he when you were


---------50:12----------
14 yeah it's pretty much always like I


---------50:15----------
remember like situations I family go to


---------50:16----------
the bar like when I was tough like that


---------50:18----------
yeah so so I think something changes in


---------50:21----------
terms of when you have a parent who's an


---------50:23----------
alcoholic and the way that they relate


---------50:25----------
to their children and something about


---------50:27----------
the way that they relate to their kids


---------50:29----------
makes children less confident and and


---------50:33----------
now I'm gonna sort of try to explain


---------50:35----------
kind of academically yep so or let me


---------50:40----------
actually ask you this how does a child


---------50:41----------
become confident kind of a question I


---------50:46----------
guess so don't answer theoretically just


---------50:50----------
start saying whatever comes to your mind


---------50:52----------
you're gonna you're gonna have a lot of


---------50:54----------
wrong answers but I'm sure you know the


---------50:55----------
right answer and we'll get you there I'd


---------50:58----------
say just like building confidence within


---------51:04----------
like success like if I was successful at


---------51:08----------
school I'd have more confidence like


---------51:10----------
sure I think I like the phrase building


---------51:13----------
yeah and and the interesting thing is I


---------51:16----------
don't think it just comes from success


---------51:17----------
right so how does like so let me put it


---------51:20----------
to you this way like in a weird way mmm


---------51:27----------
you think about how to ask this


---------51:33----------
so how did you know to go to your room


---------51:38----------
when your dad came home drunk because it


---------51:45----------
was an uncomfortable feeling that I


---------51:46----------
wanted to avoid


---------51:46----------
Sharik and and in a sense you could say


---------51:50----------
that going to your room you could be


---------51:52----------
confident in that strategy does that


---------51:53----------
make sense yeah like it's a pretty


---------51:56----------
reliable strategy yeah yeah how does how


---------51:59----------
does one learn like what's there a


---------52:01----------
reliable strategy how does one develop


---------52:03----------
I'm not talking about like confidence


---------52:05----------
even on the level of like oh I'm a


---------52:07----------
confident person I'm talking about


---------52:08----------
generally speaking like the idea of


---------52:10----------
confidence right so what is confidence


---------52:12----------
it's it's like taking an action and


---------52:14----------
being somewhat like confident talkative


---------52:17----------
the result right like it's being sort of


---------52:18----------
assured about the result so like where


---------52:21----------
does that come from like how can you be


---------52:22----------
confident that going to your room is


---------52:24----------
like the right thing to do when your dad


---------52:25----------
comes home drunk I don't know if it


---------52:28----------
really applies to the whole culture room


---------52:30----------
thing that I guess trial and error


---------52:31----------
there's like a good absolutely right so


---------52:34----------
if we think about it what leads to


---------52:36----------
better confidence like trying trying


---------52:41----------
things and then also like consistency of


---------52:43----------
outcome yeah does that make sense like


---------52:46----------
if you go to your room and then like he


---------52:48----------
shows up every now and then and like


---------52:50----------
drags you downstairs and then what's


---------52:53----------
gonna be your confidence about going to


---------52:55----------
your room is a solution lot lower so


---------52:58----------
confidence oddly enough for children


---------52:59----------
comes from order does that make sense it


---------53:03----------
has nothing to do with success of


---------53:04----------
failure it has to do with order so like


---------53:06----------
right like a confident child like so you


---------53:10----------
know like a child becomes confident in


---------53:13----------
walking when they start to be able to


---------53:16----------
predict the outcomes of their walking


---------53:18----------
right does that make sense and they also


---------53:21----------
like have have confidence and parents


---------53:23----------
because until they walk like if they


---------53:25----------
know if okay if I hold hands then I can


---------53:27----------
be confident that I walk because I'm


---------53:29----------
unstable on my own but if I'm holding an


---------53:31----------
adult's hand then I'll be able to walk


---------53:33----------
fine so can we see how they become


---------53:35----------
confident in holding an adult's hand


---------53:36----------
then graduate all the time they become


---------53:38----------
confident and walking without kids yeah


---------53:40----------
yeah so what do you think it does for


---------53:44----------
the order of a child's universe if they


---------53:46----------
have a parent


---------53:47----------
that drinks well there's no stability


---------53:50----------
really like they like it's two different


---------53:53----------
people right like he comes on one person


---------53:56----------
is another person in the morning yeah


---------53:59----------
absolutely so what what does that do for


---------54:00----------
a child's confidence well they don't


---------54:03----------
have the consistency so they don't have


---------54:06----------
the same thing over and over again yeah


---------54:09----------
Scott do you ever get worried that


---------54:11----------
you're gonna fall into the sky when you


---------54:13----------
step outside of your room


---------54:15----------
that's out of your house that's like a


---------54:17----------
metaphor I guess no practically don't


---------54:19----------
worry that you're just gonna fall into


---------54:22----------
the sky and shoot out into space


---------54:24----------
I mean I've I guess I never had that


---------54:27----------
feeling yeah huh so it sounds like in


---------54:30----------
your world gravity always goes one


---------54:31----------
direction yeah I guess this is what I've


---------54:34----------
been told yes I guess you're confident


---------54:36----------
you're very very confident in the


---------54:38----------
direction of gravity because it always


---------54:39----------
goes one right yeah so like what you're


---------54:42----------
describing to me is that you get gravity


---------54:44----------
that goes both ways when you're a kid in


---------54:46----------
terms of your parents right so you have


---------54:48----------
you have a dad that sometimes he's one


---------54:49----------
person


---------54:50----------
so it's like gravity goes in this


---------54:51----------
direction and then other times gravity


---------54:54----------
goes in this direction right and like


---------54:56----------
can you imagine how anxiety-provoking it


---------54:58----------
would be if we did not know which


---------55:00----------
direction gravity went yeah do you if I


---------55:05----------
if gravity sometimes went up and


---------55:07----------
sometimes went down


---------55:08----------
how confidently do you think I would


---------55:10----------
move through life right why because it's


---------55:16----------
not consistency you don't know what's


---------55:17----------
gonna happen yeah


---------55:19----------
so when we think about you in an


---------55:21----------
alcoholic parent like like tie things


---------55:24----------
together for me what am I trying to say


---------55:26----------
oh that I don't like I don't have the


---------55:30----------
consistency I don't have that


---------55:31----------
reliability I guess of him being but I


---------55:38----------
don't know if I'm not seeing the


---------55:40----------
connection though like I don't sure yeah


---------55:44----------
yeah so the first thing is in terms of


---------55:47----------
so if we think about a fear of rejection


---------55:49----------
right right


---------55:51----------
so like fear of rejection tends to be


---------55:54----------
can also be correlated with a lack of


---------55:55----------
confidence hmm does that make sense yeah


---------55:59----------
like the confident purse


---------56:00----------
can handle rejection better in fact the


---------56:03----------
way that you talked about your job three


---------56:05----------
weeks ago actually sounds relatively


---------56:07----------
confident right like people just say


---------56:09----------
like Oh someone else was better


---------56:10----------
qualified than I was like it's no


---------56:12----------
personal insult to you you don't feel


---------56:13----------
bad about it it's just the way of the


---------56:15----------
world


---------56:15----------
yeah is that how you feel about your


---------56:18----------
last job application I guess so


---------56:22----------
it's I don't know if it's just like numb


---------56:27----------
to like the consistency of like being


---------56:29----------
told no or like not hearing anything or


---------56:31----------
what it is but sure so it sounds like


---------56:33----------
it's a little bit complicated a little


---------56:36----------
bit in the eye towards it yeah so here's


---------56:38----------
kind of the point that I'm making so


---------56:40----------
first of all the hole comes from


---------56:42----------
somewhere so let's actually try to sort


---------56:44----------
of give us give you a brief summary okay


---------56:47----------
so if you're addicted to video games


---------56:48----------
right by the way any questions so far


---------56:52----------
well I think I'm a fully pretty okay


---------56:54----------
look at them so I'm gonna try to


---------56:55----------
summarize okay so you're addicted to


---------56:57----------
video games so the first thing to


---------56:58----------
understand is that video games are not a


---------57:00----------
problem they're a solution what do you


---------57:04----------
think about that that's a make sense


---------57:07----------
what makes sense about it the fact that


---------57:11----------
they're all like it's consistent like


---------57:13----------
it's always pretty much always gonna be


---------57:14----------
there if you're not having a good day


---------57:15----------
you can go home and play games which


---------57:17----------
means they're a solution like but at the


---------57:19----------
same time what do you think yeah sorry I


---------57:23----------
do think you can kind of get addicted to


---------57:25----------
a solution like if you have something


---------57:28----------
that's like really consistent and keeps


---------57:29----------
you happy I think we can still cling to


---------57:31----------
that feeling absolutely right so this is


---------57:35----------
also true of other addictions so like is


---------57:37----------
heroin a problem absolutely is video get


---------57:39----------
our video games a problem


---------57:41----------
absolutely is playing wow 22 hours a day


---------57:43----------
a problem absolutely and there also I


---------57:48----------
don't want you to think about it just as


---------57:49----------
an addiction just as a negative thing


---------57:51----------
but I want you to realize that it is a


---------57:53----------
solution for your brain because it


---------57:56----------
solves a problem that you have is a


---------57:58----------
problem that you have is what play it


---------58:02----------
too much I know that's so what what is


---------58:06----------
it tank


---------58:07----------
what is it tank for you I guess it takes


---------58:10----------
rejection oh yeah yeah so it sounds like


---------58:13----------
rejection and failure


---------58:14----------
main feelings of yours that it tanks


---------58:16----------
from yep so now we kind of go to so the


---------58:18----------
first thing that I just want everyone to


---------58:20----------
understand is that gaming is adaptive


---------58:22----------
and protective and is actually a


---------58:23----------
solution to another problem now that


---------58:26----------
solution can become maladaptive so


---------58:29----------
maladaptive is like when we do something


---------58:31----------
and it sort of like works in the


---------58:33----------
short-term but over time it becomes


---------58:36----------
maladaptive so it starts to cause


---------58:37----------
problems even though it was adaptive it


---------58:40----------
ones that make sense yes I think rather


---------58:43----------
than solution or problem I like the


---------58:45----------
phrase adaptive or maladaptive and the


---------58:48----------
best example of something that's that's


---------58:50----------
maladaptive that I like to use is so you


---------58:52----------
know what hypertension or high blood


---------58:55----------
pressure is yeah so do you have any idea


---------58:59----------
so if I have a blood vessel in my heart


---------59:01----------
is pumping and if I have high pressure


---------59:04----------
in that blood vessel do you know what


---------59:06----------
has that what the heart has to do you


---------59:08----------
have any idea like how do you overcome


---------59:10----------
like if I have a high amount of


---------59:12----------
resistance and I'm trying to push


---------59:15----------
something into that resistance what do I


---------59:17----------
have to do really stress release oh yeah


---------59:21----------
so releasing the resistance would be one


---------59:24----------
thing the other thing is that you can


---------59:25----------
push harder right so actually it's funny


---------59:27----------
because that's one of the ways that high


---------59:29----------
blood pressure medications work is they


---------59:30----------
reduce the resistance but one thing that


---------59:32----------
you can actually do so like basically


---------59:34----------
like when you have a high pressure


---------59:35----------
system so what happens to your for like


---------59:36----------
arteries and then if I in the job of the


---------59:40----------
heart is to pump blood into the artery


---------59:42----------
right and if I clamp down on the artery


---------59:44----------
what is what does the heart have to do


---------59:46----------
push through the clem exam so it has to


---------59:50----------
push harder so the greater the


---------59:51----------
resistance if I like if I'm lifting


---------59:53----------
weights and I increase the resistance of


---------59:56----------
the weight what do I muscles have to do


---------59:58----------
build up and push through it


---------60:01----------
exactly and that is exactly what the


---------60:03----------
heart does so the heart starts to grow


---------60:06----------
when you have high blood pressure so the


---------60:09----------
heart just like your biceps are triceps


---------60:11----------
or pectorals or whatever like anytime a


---------60:14----------
muscle hits high resistance it grows it


---------60:17----------
builds up and then the heart gets bigger


---------60:19----------
and bigger and bigger as it deals with


---------60:21----------
higher and higher and higher pressure


---------60:22----------
now the interesting thing about the


---------60:24----------
heart is that you know there's like


---------60:25----------
there's a bunch of muscle and you know


---------60:27----------
that


---------60:28----------
art is filled with blood so the muscle


---------60:29----------
needs blood to nourish it right Jo so


---------60:32----------
you have these like three arteries that


---------60:33----------
go outside the heart and they feed sort


---------60:35----------
of the outside of the heart and then


---------60:37----------
you've got blood on the inside of the


---------60:38----------
heart so the blood from the inside kind


---------60:40----------
of feeds the top half of the heart the


---------60:42----------
blood from the outside feeds the bottom


---------60:44----------
half of the heart and what do you think


---------60:45----------
happens if if the heart expands


---------60:49----------
everything else expands or is there what


---------60:52----------
happens to the blood flow so like if I'm


---------60:54----------
getting blood from here and I'm getting


---------60:55----------
blood from here what happens to the


---------60:57----------
stuff in the middle not sure it doesn't


---------61:02----------
get blood right because like there's


---------61:05----------
blood coming from here and there's blood


---------61:07----------
coming from here and if I let me put it


---------61:08----------
to you this way if I have you know if I


---------61:13----------
pour water on something like let's say a


---------61:17----------
piece of like let's say a card a piece


---------61:19----------
of cardboard if I sprinkle a little bit


---------61:21----------
of water on top and I sprinkle a little


---------61:23----------
bit of water on the bottom like the


---------61:25----------
whole cardboard is gonna get wet yeah


---------61:28----------
okay if I increase the thickness of the


---------61:30----------
cardboard ten times and I sprinkle a


---------61:32----------
little bit of water on top sprinkle a


---------61:34----------
little bit of water on bottom what


---------61:35----------
happens to the middle of the cardboard


---------61:36----------
does it get wet still start stays right


---------61:40----------
exactly so that's exactly what happens


---------61:42----------
to the heart so as the heart grows so


---------61:44----------
the heart is trying to adapt to the high


---------61:47----------
pressure system by growing and then


---------61:49----------
eventually what happens is it grows so


---------61:51----------
big that it actually the heart can't get


---------61:54----------
blood because there's blood coming from


---------61:56----------
the top and blood coming to the bottom


---------61:57----------
but the thing is so big the middle the


---------61:59----------
heart corner quote stays dry just like


---------62:01----------
you said okay and if it stays dry that


---------62:03----------
means it doesn't get nourishment and


---------62:04----------
that starts to die yeah and this is


---------62:07----------
something called congestive heart


---------62:08----------
failure so in the same way sorry for


---------62:11----------
that you know medical analogy that I


---------62:14----------
compliment you to understand is that


---------62:16----------
gaming for you was a short-term solution


---------62:19----------
that has now caused you to become a


---------62:22----------
different kind of person and that


---------62:23----------
solution is no longer working right but


---------62:26----------
what you really need to understand is


---------62:28----------
that gaming really is a tank for you and


---------62:30----------
what it's tanking in your case I think


---------62:32----------
is some sense of good enough or like


---------62:34----------
being sensitive to rejection a lack of


---------62:36----------
confidence in who you are so every


---------62:38----------
rejection hurts so I want you to just


---------62:40----------
think about this for a second


---------62:41----------
that like you know if you're confident


---------62:43----------
in who you are like let's say that I'm


---------62:46----------
content to Who I am I ask a girl out and


---------62:48----------
she says no how does that affect me you


---------62:51----------
might lose some confidence yeah and if I


---------62:55----------
have no confidence and she says no how


---------62:56----------
does that affect me I might Shetty


---------62:59----------
that's what happens every time you you


---------63:03----------
don't get a yes from a job I'd say


---------63:08----------
shadows me a little bit but a built some


---------63:10----------
resistance but yeah yeah right so you


---------63:11----------
built some resistance to it which is


---------63:13----------
also very good like it's good that you


---------63:15----------
notice that that too is sort of an


---------63:16----------
adaptation and what is your resistance


---------63:19----------
let's just think about this for a second


---------63:20----------
how have you become resistant to


---------63:21----------
shattering because you didn't say the


---------63:23----------
first feeling will better you said yeah


---------63:26----------
what is the nature of that resistance


---------63:29----------
consistency like cuz I mean I've been


---------63:31----------
doing it for a while now yep so it's


---------63:33----------
like yeah kind of


---------63:35----------
I I would venture that you've learned


---------63:37----------
how to numb yourself from it yeah yes


---------63:40----------
all right so that too is gonna be


---------63:42----------
maladaptive so I've asked you a lot of


---------63:45----------
questions I think it's it's a little bit


---------63:46----------
difficult for you to access your


---------63:48----------
feelings mm-hmm what would you say to


---------63:51----------
that that's that's pretty true yeah


---------63:54----------
right so like what's up with that I


---------63:56----------
think it's because you've learned how to


---------63:58----------
numb yourself from rejection because my


---------64:02----------
sense is that inside the trap door of


---------64:04----------
your subconscious there is a whole pile


---------64:07----------
of like feeling like a shitty human


---------64:09----------
being yeah yeah and where is that


---------64:13----------
sensation throughout the day hiding


---------64:17----------
behind the bridge that is games


---------64:19----------
absolutely beautifully put right so that


---------64:22----------
too is like when we try to do when I ask


---------64:24----------
you someone kind of these exploratory


---------64:25----------
questions like it's you know you're kind


---------64:28----------
of like I'm getting shades of gray but


---------64:30----------
I'm not getting a whole lot of color


---------64:32----------
like you were to say like okay how did


---------64:34----------
your dad make you feel like you say


---------64:35----------
uncomfortable like we're you know that's


---------64:38----------
you know I I completely agree that he


---------64:41----------
made you feel uncomfortable but uncommon


---------64:42----------
so we're sort of like a shallow term


---------64:44----------
it's not like yeah you know do make


---------64:46----------
direct oh yeah so did he make you feel


---------64:48----------
ashamed did he make make you were you


---------64:50----------
frightened of him were you angry with


---------64:53----------
him they're all


---------64:54----------
those kinds of things that kind of fall


---------64:55----------
under uncomfortable yeah so kind of just


---------64:58----------
going back to our analogy so like I


---------65:00----------
think gaming is adaptive right so it


---------65:02----------
tanks so this is the the floorboards


---------65:04----------
over the pit and then that pit comes


---------65:07----------
from somewhere so in your case I'm not


---------65:09----------
sure exactly where it comes from but so


---------65:10----------
we sort of hypothesized maybe it comes


---------65:12----------
from bullying it sounds like it doesn't


---------65:13----------
come from bullying it sounds like the


---------65:15----------
feeling that is closer is actually the


---------65:17----------
feeling that like something around the


---------65:20----------
way that your dad made you uncomfortable


---------65:22----------
is that fair or not really I'd say in a


---------65:27----------
way but I'm not really a hunter sensor


---------65:33----------
which is sure so what are the yeah yeah


---------65:36----------
one of the way I think one of the


---------65:39----------
primary reasons that I really wanted to


---------65:40----------
come on here and talk to you was


---------65:41----------
premature so I can get a bit more


---------65:43----------
understanding off that so I can kind of


---------65:44----------
at least get a little more knowledge on


---------65:46----------
what it might be


---------65:47----------
yeah yes so I think I'm not sure if it's


---------65:50----------
partially your dad or other things and


---------65:52----------
we can give this another shot


---------65:53----------
okay like I know we can continue talking


---------65:55----------
after at my summary but the first thing


---------65:57----------
is that gaming isn't adaptive is


---------65:58----------
adaptive and is actually a solution the


---------66:01----------
second thing is that it protects you


---------66:02----------
from the pit but the pit was dug


---------66:03----------
somewhere else we haven't quite been


---------66:05----------
able to figure out sounds like it's not


---------66:07----------
bullying maybe has something to do with


---------66:08----------
your dad maybe not and that ultimately


---------66:11----------
your solution is gonna be twofold one is


---------66:14----------
to try to fill in the pit because if you


---------66:16----------
can deal with that underlying sense of


---------66:18----------
rejection or that lack of confidence and


---------66:22----------
that to your lack of confidence may come


---------66:24----------
from the disorder of your childhood


---------66:26----------
right because like that kid like when


---------66:29----------
you just don't know like it's really


---------66:30----------
hard to have let me just think about


---------66:33----------
this for a second like how difficult is


---------66:35----------
it for a child who has like dr. Jekyll


---------66:38----------
and mr. Hyde for a panic I'm not sure


---------66:44----------
the two people I'm sorry like you know


---------66:50----------
like who's who's another good example of


---------66:52----------
someone who's got like yeah I'm trying


---------66:57----------
to think of it because Clark can be


---------66:59----------
Superman is not really a good example


---------67:00----------
but


---------67:03----------
who's a good twitch at help me out hold


---------67:05----------
on I'm gonna to face your face also ID


---------67:13----------
idaho yeah hope yeah I don't know Harvey


---------67:20----------
Dent to face huh you familiar with heart


---------67:24----------
oh yeah let's go to your face yeah what


---------67:32----------
what T's Walter White ah nah man Walter


---------67:36----------
White he just changed from good to bad


---------67:39----------
it's not it's good so so my point is


---------67:41----------
like you know you don't know who you're


---------67:42----------
getting right so you're like it's it's


---------67:44----------
really confusing when you have a parent


---------67:46----------
who's loving and kind and supportive but


---------67:48----------
then like another day it's like gravity


---------67:50----------
is going up or gravity's going down


---------67:51----------
that's just [ __ ] hard yeah so so I


---------67:54----------
think something about your lack of


---------67:55----------
confidence probably comes from that


---------67:57----------
that's a so yeah so something about the


---------68:00----------
whole comes from there and then the


---------68:02----------
problem is that as you mentioned earlier


---------68:04----------
like you know when you don't have


---------68:06----------
confidence and you get rejected it's


---------68:08----------
shattering and then on top of that when


---------68:10----------
I when you say like you know what does


---------68:13----------
rejection do to you in your responses it


---------68:15----------
shatters me a little bit like that's an


---------68:18----------
oxymoron if I've ever heard one yeah


---------68:21----------
even that don't make sense because I


---------68:23----------
think another adaptive mechanism that


---------68:25----------
you have is you've learned how to numb


---------68:27----------
yourself to the pain of being shattered


---------68:29----------
but I do think you'll get shattered with


---------68:31----------
every rejection hmm and so I think your


---------68:35----------
way forward is twofold one is to


---------68:37----------
understand that gaming is like is


---------68:40----------
tanking and that at some point like what


---------68:42----------
you're gonna have to do is stop letting


---------68:45----------
and you've got to understand that gaming


---------68:47----------
is gonna be a very good solution but I


---------68:51----------
think you're actually doing a really


---------68:51----------
good job if you applied for a job three


---------68:53----------
weeks ago that's actually really good


---------68:55----------
and at some point you've got to


---------68:57----------
understand that like you're gonna be


---------68:58----------
shattered a little bit more and and not


---------69:02----------
so much that you get used to the


---------69:04----------
shattering because that you've already


---------69:05----------
done but I do think it's possible for


---------69:07----------
you to how can I say this not get


---------69:11----------
shattered by a rejection through sort of


---------69:14----------
intentional growth


---------69:16----------
right so like instead of like numbing


---------69:19----------
yourself to those feelings like really


---------69:21----------
sitting with those feelings


---------69:22----------
walking through them and like letting


---------69:26----------
them kind of pass through you because


---------69:28----------
right now I think what's going on is


---------69:30----------
each rejection sort of like adds junk to


---------69:33----------
your inventory and you're not really


---------69:35----------
like ven during that junk and so


---------69:38----------
overtime like your subconscious is just


---------69:40----------
cluttered with all this trash that is


---------69:42----------
like you know and what you really need


---------69:45----------
to do is vendor your junk but I don't


---------69:47----------
think you do that because what you


---------69:48----------
essentially do is you close the bag and


---------69:51----------
that's your numbness you just close your


---------69:52----------
inventory you're like [ __ ] this is such


---------69:54----------
a mess and you just closed the inventory


---------69:56----------
and then you keep on trying to live life


---------69:58----------
and then you don't have any like room


---------70:00----------
for good [ __ ] in there because all the


---------70:02----------
bad [ __ ] is filling up your subconscious


---------70:04----------
subconscious actually works but like


---------70:05----------
that by the way if it's filled with a


---------70:07----------
bad [ __ ] there actually isn't room for


---------70:08----------
good [ __ ] good stuff yeah and and so I


---------70:11----------
think you've got to open up your bags


---------70:13----------
and vendor some of that [ __ ] so some of


---------70:15----------
that can be through you know we can try


---------70:17----------
to talk a little bit further after this


---------70:19----------
if you feel like it we can you can see a


---------70:22----------
therapist or something like that have


---------70:23----------
you ever tried to see a therapist I have


---------70:26----------
once yeah but didn't okay so that's


---------70:29----------
something worth kind of reconsidering


---------70:31----------
the other thing is is you know we have


---------70:34----------
to try to fill in that pit so we have to


---------70:36----------
figure out like where did this lack of


---------70:38----------
confidence in this sensitivity to


---------70:40----------
rejection come from I mean I think the


---------70:42----------
eczema honestly sounds like that would


---------70:44----------
make someone pretty [ __ ] sensitive or


---------70:45----------
rejection you know to be like judged for


---------70:48----------
like your face and someone call you an


---------70:51----------
alien because your eyes are probably


---------70:52----------
like that sounds like it's a pretty bad


---------70:54----------
[ __ ] rejection yeah


---------70:56----------
appreciating and and so it you know it


---------70:59----------
strikes me as a little bit odd that you


---------71:01----------
feel like the the feeling is actually


---------71:03----------
different but I'm gonna respect that I'm


---------71:05----------
gonna assume you're right because I


---------71:06----------
think it if you feel like it's not the


---------71:08----------
same it's not the same you may have more


---------71:10----------
than one kind of rejection sensitive


---------71:11----------
sensitivity one of them does feel to me


---------71:14----------
it makes sense though because you said


---------71:15----------
one of them feels like a lot more


---------71:16----------
persecutory and then the other one the


---------71:19----------
other sort of like you know the job


---------71:21----------
application thing doesn't feel like it's


---------71:23----------
a personal insult it feels like you're a


---------71:25----------
cog in the wheel and you're just getting


---------71:26----------
railroaded by the system yeah and so I


---------71:29----------
wonder if


---------71:30----------
you've if you know there's been a time


---------71:32----------
in your life where you felt like you got


---------71:33----------
railroaded by the system that possibly


---------71:38----------
yeah I'd say it could be a thing or no


---------71:43----------
I'd say it could be yeah yeah I mean so


---------71:46----------
so what do you think about this kind of


---------71:48----------
so one strategy is to like kind of


---------71:50----------
change a little bit like recognize that


---------71:52----------
gaming is actually gonna be doing a lot


---------71:53----------
of important stuff for your brain and to


---------71:56----------
try to catch those moments and to try to


---------71:58----------
like actually expose yourself to a


---------72:00----------
little bit more negative emotion so


---------72:03----------
that's one option


---------72:04----------
second option is you have to figure out


---------72:06----------
whether the source of this rejection


---------72:08----------
sensitivity comes from and try to you


---------72:10----------
know cleanse that debuff right I'd say


---------72:14----------
probably just like expose myself to a


---------72:16----------
little bit it's probably like a bit of a


---------72:18----------
better bet for me I think okay so I


---------72:22----------
think that's something I'll try it's


---------72:23----------
just yeah just scary what's scary about


---------72:27----------
it


---------72:27----------
well expose myself to kind of like the


---------72:31----------
negativity and things like that yeah you


---------72:33----------
wanna try that here like right like


---------72:37----------
explain oh yeah I mean do you want to


---------72:40----------
try it here yeah okay so close your eyes


---------72:44----------
sit up straight okay we're gonna try it


---------72:48----------
a different way so when was the last


---------72:51----------
time that a rejection really hurt so it


---------72:54----------
sounds like this last one wasn't that


---------72:55----------
bad yeah this one that says around come


---------73:01----------
around three months ago I got a job


---------73:04----------
interview and it felt like it went well


---------73:06----------
and I said I was something like get in


---------73:10----------
touch with him and I mean I was quite


---------73:13----------
excited for the job like I thought it


---------73:15----------
was something that I could do they're


---------73:16----------
sort of like helped me keep like healthy


---------73:18----------
and on my feet and things like that and


---------73:20----------
obviously I thought it went well


---------73:22----------
like the interview it was like really


---------73:23----------
nice and things like that and I just


---------73:24----------
didn't hear anything and it was just a


---------73:27----------
fact that like I didn't get a no that I


---------73:28----------
just kind of like kept lingering and it


---------73:30----------
just felt like as each day went past


---------73:33----------
like that's thinking just that got worse


---------73:35----------
and worse and worse okay so do something


---------73:37----------
that was successful definitely in the


---------73:41----------
chest like it's just


---------73:44----------
the feeling of thinking that something


---------73:47----------
was gonna start doing well and then it


---------73:49----------
wasn't like you get on a high


---------73:50----------
temporarily and then you just like


---------73:52----------
gradually feel this one consistently so


---------73:54----------
so it kind of feels like you know an


---------73:56----------
elevation followed by like a depression


---------73:59----------
you know like every disappointment yeah


---------74:07----------
interesting


---------74:10----------
have you had that feeling before like


---------74:13----------
that that kind of excitement in your


---------74:14----------
chest followed by kind of like this


---------74:18----------
thing yeah yeah yeah I've heard quite a


---------74:21----------
bit can you tell me about a couple of


---------74:23----------
times


---------74:26----------
one of the ones was like a test from


---------74:29----------
school okay so do you like drama and


---------74:31----------
things like that the girl like acting I


---------74:32----------
thought I'd do well and I'm like it's


---------74:35----------
pretty much that kind of situations


---------74:36----------
right like I kind of myself up for that


---------74:38----------
and I did well and I didn't like


---------74:40----------
misguiding myself and then one of the


---------74:44----------
situation was pretty much similar to the


---------74:46----------
last job one where I thought I did


---------74:48----------
really well everyone ended up like I


---------74:51----------
actually had got a call for that one and


---------74:53----------
thought they were just gonna say let's


---------74:56----------
start on Tuesday whatever and they were


---------74:57----------
just like they remember like like the


---------75:02----------
shadow like the feeling of just like


---------75:04----------
nothing pretty much like second like a


---------75:12----------
quick sudden sink like like a movie is


---------75:14----------
when they just like fall through water


---------75:15----------
yeah


---------75:17----------
first like that why are you I think um I


---------75:21----------
don't know I think it's a coping


---------75:22----------
mechanism at have what are you feeling


---------75:23----------
right now


---------75:25----------
um I don't think it's like embarrassment


---------75:27----------
it's just it is a little bit


---------75:30----------
uncomfortable like talking about this


---------75:31----------
stuff but I think that's weird even so I


---------75:33----------
want to suffer I'm not really sure I


---------75:39----------
think it's kind of yeah I just focus so


---------75:44----------
tell me what it feels like it just feels


---------75:49----------
yeah quite shallow on my chest like


---------75:53----------
can't really tell where like the


---------75:55----------
surfaces I just cry feels I got a little


---------75:58----------
bit empty okay I want you to just focus


---------76:03----------
in on that feeling


---------76:06----------
the shallowness of your chest the


---------76:08----------
emptiness of your chest


---------76:14----------
and now what's happening to the feeling


---------76:17----------
it's kind of soothing over a little bit


---------76:19----------
yeah it's kind of interesting you can


---------76:22----------
even see it you can see the change come


---------76:24----------
over you try to feel it soothing over it


---------76:31----------
what does that mean


---------76:34----------
it's like um I got like a visual thing


---------76:39----------
of like I'm that like soothing the


---------76:42----------
cement of a bricks and they like


---------76:44----------
building so okay so you're kind of


---------76:47----------
you're kind of helping it out it's yeah


---------76:50----------
yeah so let me ask you something is


---------76:54----------
there a particular time where you felt


---------76:56----------
that feeling of kind of shallowness or


---------76:58----------
emptiness pretty profoundly


---------77:02----------
[Music]


---------77:08----------
can't think of like any other like


---------77:11----------
really specific situations okay


---------77:14----------
how did you feel when your dad passed


---------77:15----------
away um yeah my yeah definitely felt the


---------77:26----------
big sink like yeah it was kind of like a


---------77:32----------
mixture of like panic and the shallow


---------77:36----------
sinking feeling like being sent like the


---------77:39----------
thud what what about what about that


---------77:47----------
situation what was it were their


---------77:48----------
thoughts that came with the shallow


---------77:50----------
sinking feeling in the thud yeah cuz cuz


---------77:59----------
my mom give another call back I'm just


---------78:01----------
like hear their distress and it just hit


---------78:06----------
my cone I really capture the feeling at


---------78:10----------
the moment but yeah just like a big sink


---------78:18----------
so fell very frantic like I want to be


---------78:21----------
there but did you have I mean I think


---------78:25----------
it's you know any parent passing away is


---------78:27----------
very very difficult is there something


---------78:30----------
in the same flavor or color as what


---------78:33----------
we've been talking about with your dad


---------78:35----------
passing away the I mean this the sinking


---------78:41----------
feeling of that is quite similar to when


---------78:44----------
I got the phone call for the not getting


---------78:47----------
the job but obviously on a much grander


---------78:50----------
scale sure of course and and well so did


---------78:54----------
that when your dad passed away did you


---------78:56----------
feel like I mean does that feel like I


---------78:59----------
know it's gonna sound like a weird work


---------79:00----------
but I'm asking you literally in your


---------79:02----------
body does it feel like a rejection yeah


---------79:06----------
what do you think it was it that got


---------79:08----------
rejected


---------79:12----------
and the losing the opportunity to show


---------79:20----------
that I can do better mmm yes that's kind


---------79:25----------
of interesting I mean oddly enough Scott


---------79:28----------
I think that is the statement that


---------79:29----------
you've made that feels the most full


---------79:30----------
circle to me because I had kind of


---------79:34----------
written down on my paper that there was


---------79:35----------
fear of rejection and what you're really


---------79:37----------
wanting to do is like make people proud


---------79:43----------
did you want to make your dad proud yeah


---------79:48----------
why is he


---------79:54----------
I'd said certain things I guess but as a


---------79:57----------
whole I probably could have done better


---------79:58----------
but yeah not sure do you feel like you


---------80:05----------
screwed up out of it yeah


---------80:09----------
now help me understand when you say a


---------80:11----------
little bit does that actually mean


---------80:13----------
focus yeah because there could be other


---------80:17----------
feelings there right so so yeah because


---------80:19----------
it's completely reasonable for you to


---------80:21----------
think that you didn't screw up that big


---------80:22----------
because you know yeah who do you who do


---------80:30----------
you feel like you've let down primarily


---------80:35----------
him because like I know that I could


---------80:39----------
have done better and it's just not


---------80:42----------
living up to the potential that I like I


---------80:45----------
think I have inside me mm-hmm


---------80:49----------
so now I'm gonna ask you a question


---------80:51----------
Scott when you get rejected I think that


---------80:56----------
there there there are two parts of you I


---------80:59----------
think there's a part of you that feels


---------81:00----------
like you have the potential to do great


---------81:03----------
things in a weird way and now I'm gonna


---------81:06----------
be a little bit Freudian okay so you


---------81:08----------
have to forgive me a little bit if this


---------81:10----------
is just this would just be complete


---------81:11----------
[ __ ] so I want I want you to imagine


---------81:14----------
that there are two versions of your dad


---------81:16----------
right the one who's not drunk and the


---------81:19----------
one who's drunk and then each of those


---------81:21----------
versions in turn creates two versions of


---------81:25----------
you yeah there's the dad who taught you


---------81:28----------
how to play football who played Final


---------81:31----------
Fantasy with you there's that guy and so


---------81:33----------
then there's also two Scott's there's


---------81:36----------
the Scott who's confident in himself and


---------81:38----------
knows he has potential and then there's


---------81:41----------
another Scott who is kind of unsure


---------81:43----------
about what he's worth does that make


---------81:46----------
sense yeah it does


---------81:49----------
and then I think that what what maybe is


---------81:54----------
very scary for you is that you're not


---------81:56----------
sure which of those Scott's is real and


---------82:00----------
every time you get rejected maybe it


---------82:02----------
terrifies you a little bit that the one


---------82:06----------
who's a failure is actually


---------82:07----------
the real Scott yeah


---------82:11----------
it's yes that's pretty accurate


---------82:17----------
yeah so I'm gonna just I just want you


---------82:21----------
to sit with that thought for a second


---------82:23----------
okay I want you to try to how can I say


---------82:28----------
this do you know how those two Scots


---------82:30----------
feel different what their experience of


---------82:37----------
them is or their experience of you


---------82:39----------
because sometimes you're one Scott and


---------82:41----------
sometimes you're the other Scott yes


---------82:46----------
because I mean I guess I have moments of


---------82:48----------
like confidence when I think I've done


---------82:51----------
like if I thought after the interviews


---------82:54----------
for example something like that mm-hmm


---------82:56----------
so I guess that was that like an example


---------82:58----------
of one Scott the other is the other


---------83:00----------
maybe or and I think what's what's


---------83:02----------
really scary is that you start to


---------83:04----------
believe that you're the successful Scott


---------83:06----------
and then life shows you that actually


---------83:08----------
that Scott is false and you're actually


---------83:11----------
a piece of [ __ ] yeah is that how it


---------83:14----------
feels yeah and I think that the sinking


---------83:17----------
feeling is probably the transition like


---------83:18----------
the noticing moment so your road forward


---------83:22----------
so right now which Scott do you feel


---------83:23----------
like the piece of [ __ ] okay and is there


---------83:30----------
what does that feel like


---------83:34----------
disappointing okay physically an


---------83:39----------
emotional yeah physically how does it


---------83:42----------
feel


---------83:47----------
I'm not good like I don't know how to


---------83:53----------
explain it physically I guess um it's


---------83:57----------
something that you feel in a part of


---------83:59----------
your body or your entire body


---------84:00----------
pretty much the entire body I don't


---------84:03----------
think it resides in one place it it it's


---------84:06----------
pervasive right yeah I want you to


---------84:09----------
breathe into your body and then exhale


---------84:19----------
so as you breathe in I want you to


---------84:22----------
imagine vitality coming in and it's


---------84:30----------
suffusing you you can feel that breath


---------84:32----------
throughout your entire body and all of


---------84:35----------
the sense of disappointment and and


---------84:37----------
failure that / that has just fills up


---------84:40----------
every single cell in your body is


---------84:42----------
getting jostled by that vitality and as


---------84:47----------
you breathe out I want you to like


---------84:51----------
squeeze that negativity out of you like


---------84:54----------
you're twisting a wet rag you're


---------85:00----------
bringing in so imagine that you're like


---------85:02----------
a rag that's full of dirty water and


---------85:03----------
then you add clean water to it with each


---------85:06----------
breath and then you wring it out so a


---------85:09----------
lot of dirt leaves but there's still a


---------85:10----------
lot of dirt that remains and so which


---------85:13----------
eat with each breath you're adding more


---------85:16----------
clean water and with each cycle with


---------85:20----------
each exhalation you're wringing out more


---------85:22----------
dirt good now transition to the nose


---------85:32----------
the hard for us


---------85:44----------
good


---------85:56----------
what are you feeling


---------85:59----------
cleaner good


---------86:07----------
so I want you to do three more breaths


---------86:09----------
like that and then let your breathing


---------86:11----------
return to normal


---------86:28----------
good and now Scott I want you to listen


---------86:33----------
so I want you to understand that


---------86:35----------
successful Scott and failure Scott are


---------86:39----------
both false that fundamentally you're not


---------86:45----------
dirty water and you're not clean water


---------86:48----------
that's like successful Scott and failure


---------86:51----------
Scott what you actually are is the rack


---------86:54----------
that's the real you in in order for you


---------86:58----------
to really move past this what you really


---------87:00----------
need to let go is not just the sense of


---------87:02----------
disappointment the sense of


---------87:04----------
disappointment is something that you buy


---------87:06----------
yourself when you have the what


---------87:15----------
confluence or absolutely is bizarre as


---------87:19----------
that sounds right so this is the really


---------87:22----------
really tricky thing is that when you


---------87:24----------
have the expectation or hope or


---------87:27----------
confidence for success that's just


---------87:32----------
that's like the casting bar for the


---------87:35----------
actual spell of disappointment you're


---------87:38----------
building it up with the confidence and


---------87:40----------
then when your spell cast finishes


---------87:42----------
you're gonna launch that fireball or


---------87:44----------
frost bolt or whatever right and so what


---------87:47----------
you really need to do is take a step


---------87:49----------
back from both of those things


---------87:50----------
and just try to be like so so take a


---------87:54----------
snapshot like how do you feel right now


---------87:58----------
um a lot more tranquil yes are you


---------88:04----------
successful right now I mean more so than


---------88:08----------
I was like an hour ago


---------88:10----------
okay I feel more like I understand the


---------88:13----------
situation a little more so I agree with


---------88:16----------
you that you understand the situation


---------88:17----------
are you successful no good are you a


---------88:23----------
failure yes


---------88:27----------
a little bit a little bit okay but less


---------88:30----------
so than before right yeah yeah you feel


---------88:33----------
like a failure in this moment yes okay


---------88:36----------
so I want you to try to notice that that


---------88:39----------
feeling of failure is not actually you


---------88:42----------
but is something that fills your cells


---------88:45----------
does that make sense


---------88:47----------
it does yeah so it's like you still have


---------88:50----------
a bunch of crap that you need to vendor


---------88:52----------
we're not gonna cure you yet it's not


---------88:54----------
like you can just click one button and


---------88:56----------
sell all your trash but I want you to


---------88:58----------
notice what has changed in you so you've


---------89:00----------
you've shed a little bit of failure but


---------89:03----------
you have not gained a little bit of


---------89:04----------
success does that make sense more for


---------89:09----------
space for success though sure but what I


---------89:12----------
really want you to notice is that so far


---------89:15----------
you have thought that when you reduce


---------89:17----------
failure success comes it's a seesaw


---------89:20----------
right right but you're not actually any


---------89:22----------
more successful you've just stepped off


---------89:24----------
of the seesaw a little bit so it has


---------89:26----------
less up and down and and the more that


---------89:29----------
you can understand like the more you can


---------89:31----------
become closer to what you are now and I


---------89:34----------
see that you know you still feel the


---------89:35----------
failure you're pretty profoundly so I


---------89:37----------
think you've got to do this kind of


---------89:38----------
practice like this visualization of like


---------89:40----------
wringing out the dirt that's relieved


---------89:43----------
you've got to do I think the better off


---------89:47----------
you're gonna feel right and when it


---------89:50----------
comes to applying for a job it sounds


---------89:53----------
like you apply for how many jobs per


---------89:55----------
month mm-hmm two three yeah so I think


---------90:00----------
that this is where what you need you


---------90:02----------
also need to do is each one of those


---------90:04----------
what happens is like you enter the cycle


---------90:07----------
of success or failure with each job that


---------90:09----------
you apply to does that make it sup does


---------90:12----------
that make sense so actually what you


---------90:14----------
need to do is if you're gonna apply for


---------90:16----------
three jobs a month so be it but apply to


---------90:18----------
them all at the same time we're good


---------90:21----------
what do you think that's gonna do it's


---------90:27----------
I feel like it if it does it all at once


---------90:29----------
it just I don't know what like the


---------90:33----------
actual feeling would be but did you feel


---------90:42----------
a little more relieving I guess yeah why


---------90:45----------
I don't know if it like gets it out of


---------90:48----------
the way or if I if I get the surge of


---------90:51----------
positivity or what I hope it does for


---------90:55----------
you is it deep personalizes the process


---------90:58----------
this is the other really really really


---------91:00----------
big thing you need to do Scott you need


---------91:03----------
to deep personalize this process of


---------91:05----------
finding a job right now your value as a


---------91:08----------
human being is tied to a particular job


---------91:12----------
what job outcome does that make sense


---------91:14----------
your value is a person that is


---------91:17----------
determined by whether you get the job or


---------91:18----------
you don't get the job as you apply for


---------91:22----------
more jobs in a shorter period of time


---------91:24----------
you become uncoupled from the job


---------91:27----------
process right so practically I think


---------91:31----------
it'll be better for you to apply to more


---------91:32----------
jobs faster okay now tell me what's


---------91:38----------
what's happening to the shallowness or


---------91:40----------
emptiness in your chest how's that doing


---------91:43----------
it feels pretty patched up or like


---------91:46----------
soothed over I guess okay


---------91:49----------
now good so I think you just did a


---------91:52----------
little bit you just cast a you know a


---------91:54----------
flash heal yeah you can open your eyes


---------91:59----------
whenever you're ready good I'm glad


---------92:05----------
you're feeling a little bit better and


---------92:06----------
he has been helpful not helpful yeah


---------92:09----------
it's official


---------92:10----------
yeah no official for sure why it gave me


---------92:15----------
more realization of make it's not a sale


---------92:20----------
of the root of the problem but like the


---------92:21----------
the cause I guess like the the multiple


---------92:24----------
things and maybe identify those a bit


---------92:26----------
better which is good because I think and


---------92:29----------
I can learn from that identified that


---------92:39----------
Patrick's for that's so Scott I think


---------92:44----------
you do a fabulous job of explaining when


---------92:46----------
you think you do a bad job that I have


---------92:54----------
understand like the one I actually feel


---------92:56----------
about like success and things like that


---------92:57----------
I feel like I need to just do things


---------93:03----------
rather than think about the mom well I


---------93:06----------
want them of it yeah I feel like that's


---------93:08----------
one thing that like games have helped a


---------93:10----------
lot with it's just it helps the ball


---------93:13----------
went out of it


---------93:13----------
yes it helps you what like mellow it out


---------93:17----------
sure yeah oh what's a hot yeah so so I


---------93:25----------
think that that's actually really good


---------93:27----------
so I think when you say mellowed out so


---------93:29----------
I think another way that I would


---------93:31----------
describe that is like depersonalization


---------93:32----------
yeah right yeah so so like we you need


---------93:35----------
to like I was saying earlier remove


---------93:36----------
yourself from the equation and much like


---------93:38----------
your questing and Wow like like when


---------93:39----------
you're when you're doing stranglethorn


---------93:41----------
Vale is that right we're doing


---------93:44----------
stranglethorn Vale like do you do you


---------93:45----------
take one quest at a time and go out and


---------93:48----------
do it may I get multiple did I area it's


---------93:51----------
more efficient job-seeking process yeah


---------93:57----------
you're more efficient if I do the


---------93:59----------
Milan's yeah absolutely right so this is


---------94:02----------
the last crazy thing I'll leave with you


---------94:03----------
is I think you can actually learn a lot


---------94:04----------
from video games I think that that a lot


---------94:07----------
of the gamers that I work with when I


---------94:08----------
actually help I feel like I'm sort of


---------94:12----------
I've Unleashed them into some


---------94:14----------
environments like I've set them up with


---------94:15----------
things like internships and things like


---------94:16----------
that in the past sometimes you have


---------94:18----------
startups and even at places like there's


---------94:21----------
a really good University in Boston


---------94:23----------
called Massachusetts Institute of


---------94:25----------
Technology and my favorite thing to do


---------94:27----------
with gamers that I work with in Boston


---------94:29----------
is to set them up at MIT or in mi t--'s


---------94:34----------
incubator which is like their


---------94:35----------
entrepreneurship sort of thing so you'll


---------94:37----------
get like PhD students at MIT and then if


---------94:40----------
I stick a gamer who has no job


---------94:41----------
experience if I just drop them in one of


---------94:44----------
those internships they actually do a


---------94:45----------
phenomenal job so I think a lot of


---------94:48----------
they're they're very analytical thinking


---------94:50----------
and a lot of the way that they


---------94:51----------
solving stuff is actually very very


---------94:53----------
helpful the other interesting thing is


---------94:55----------
that there tend to be very very


---------94:56----------
dedicated so I know you grind Wow for 18


---------94:59----------
or 20 hours a day I've dropped people in


---------95:01----------
internships who will work for 20 hours a


---------95:03----------
day and they absolutely love it and they


---------95:05----------
do a phenomenal job so I think that you


---------95:07----------
can absolutely learn things from world


---------95:09----------
of warcraft you can learn how to be


---------95:11----------
efficient you can learn how to you know


---------95:13----------
you can you can learn a lot and overall


---------95:16----------
you know Scott I really do wish you the


---------95:18----------
best of luck I'm kind of I'm satisfied


---------95:25----------
with where we are how do you feel as a


---------95:29----------
satisfied as a good word for it I feel


---------95:32----------
ya satisfied like I liked this


---------95:35----------
experiment solo you use the word a lot


---------95:39----------
help me understand that


---------95:40----------
I this will feel me like this will help


---------95:47----------
me a lot like it with the whole I plan


---------95:50----------
for a lot at once makes a lot more sense


---------95:52----------
when I visualize it in like a different


---------95:53----------
light which is one thing I always kind


---------95:55----------
of had trouble with just like yeah yeah


---------96:02----------
that's it's yeah very very satisfying


---------96:04----------
good I'm glad so I think that one of the


---------96:06----------
things I'm noticing about you is I don't


---------96:07----------
think you have a whole lot of emotional


---------96:10----------
expression which I think has to do with


---------96:12----------
some of your numbness so it's you're


---------96:14----------
saying a lot but you look basically the


---------96:16----------
same as when I first saw you true


---------96:20----------
so it's hard for me to gauge what your


---------96:22----------
response has been without words because


---------96:24----------
usually yes I think in some ways I think


---------96:26----------
you really are kind of emotionally like


---------96:30----------
pretty um yeah like pretty like your


---------96:33----------
your emotional like wave length is


---------96:35----------
actually pretty flat right so like your


---------96:37----------
emotion has been like this and and so


---------96:40----------
it's useful I mean it's helpful for me


---------96:42----------
to hear that this has been helpful and I


---------96:43----------
you know I really hope it has been


---------96:44----------
helpful you know keep us posted on how


---------96:47----------
you're doing and any questions before we


---------96:50----------
wrap up for the day no think I'm pretty


---------96:53----------
good it was a raisin thank you so much


---------96:56----------
you're very welcome and good luck dude


---------96:57----------
Ches every door


---------97:01----------
okay so emotions don't help you grind


---------97:09----------
wow that's that's why you that's why you


---------97:12----------
get rid of a man who needs emotions when


---------97:14----------
you're grinding Wow so let me ask you


---------97:17----------
guys a quick question did y'all follow


---------97:18----------
that meditation I guess I should have oh


---------97:27----------
yeah so people are asking did he have


---------97:29----------
some amount of alexithymia he had a ton


---------97:31----------
of alexithymia


---------97:38----------
okay


---------97:40----------
so yes no kinda okay um let me just


---------97:51----------
think okay so let's just do a little bit


---------97:54----------
of Nardi should be let's do some


---------97:55----------
alternate nostril breathing okay so I


---------97:57----------
should have you're a sociopath how do


---------98:02----------
you gain empathy I'm not sure that


---------98:04----------
you're a sociopath I think just because


---------98:06----------
you have a lack of empathy or emotional


---------98:08----------
numbness doesn't mean you're a sociopath


---------98:09----------
so not feeling things doesn't


---------98:12----------
necessarily


---------98:13----------
that's a symptom that's not a diagnosis


---------98:15----------
right so diagnosis is sociopathy but


---------98:17----------
there are all kinds of other reasons why


---------98:18----------
you may not have empathy burnout


---------98:21----------
alexithymia all kinds of things okay so


---------98:26----------
Nardi should be okay or nadi shodhana so


---------98:38----------
this is alternate nostril breathing so


---------98:41----------
we'll do this again so I want you guys


---------98:42----------
to do this


---------98:50----------
okay actually I I there's a good


---------98:52----------
question here so I'm gonna expand on it


---------98:54----------
a little bit so someone asks can you


---------98:56----------
expand on the alcoholic parents and


---------98:58----------
gaming addiction thing yeah so like so I


---------99:01----------
starting in 2015 I started working with


---------99:06----------
gamers right so that was about five


---------99:08----------
years ago now one of the most surprising


---------99:10----------
things that I discovered was that like


---------99:13----------
about 30% of the gamers that I've worked


---------99:16----------
with over maybe like 200 or 300 or 400


---------99:19----------
be gamers that sounds kind of high


---------99:22----------
probably lower than that but of the ones


---------99:24----------
that I worked with individually which


---------99:26----------
was maybe like a hundred or two hundred


---------99:27----------
I'd say like a third of whom had


---------99:29----------
actually alcoholic parents or one parent


---------99:31----------
who was alcoholic and I was just very


---------99:33----------
very surprised because I had always


---------99:36----------
thought of gaming addiction as like an


---------99:38----------
individual dopamine kind of thing like


---------99:40----------
you know it's about the dopamine in your


---------99:42----------
brain and stuff like that it really has


---------99:45----------
nothing to do with you know having


---------99:47----------
alcoholic parents so there are two or


---------99:49----------
three hypotheses one is that you know if


---------99:54----------
you're prone to addiction in your brain


---------99:55----------
whether it be alcohol or another


---------99:57----------
substance may be the vulnerable the


---------100:00----------
biological vulnerability to alcohol in


---------100:02----------
some way translates to a biological


---------100:04----------
vulnerability to video game addiction


---------100:06----------
right so this some people say they have


---------100:09----------
a corner quote addictive personality I


---------100:10----------
don't really quite buy that sort of


---------100:12----------
sense but I think it's complicated so


---------100:15----------
one option is that there's a biological


---------100:16----------
predisposition that is genetically


---------100:18----------
inherited to be addicted from one


---------100:20----------
substance to be addicted to another


---------100:22----------
substance now I don't really hold too


---------100:25----------
much to that theory because what we do


---------100:27----------
know from genetic inherent your


---------100:29----------
inheritance is that like being addicted


---------100:33----------
to alcoholic so if you have a


---------100:34----------
predisposition for alcoholism it doesn't


---------100:37----------
necessarily mean that you're gonna get


---------100:38----------
addicted to heroin so like addiction is


---------100:40----------
substance specific so you have


---------100:42----------
alcoholism that runs in families and you


---------100:45----------
have like opiate addiction that runs in


---------100:46----------
families and that people also have a


---------100:49----------
quarter unquote drug of choice so the


---------100:51----------
question is why do people have a drug of


---------100:52----------
choice like biologically why is it that


---------100:54----------
some people get addicted to alcohol and


---------100:56----------
some people get addicted to opiates and


---------100:58----------
some people get addicted to marijuana


---------100:59----------
some people get addicted to math like


---------101:01----------
why do people get addicted to differ


---------101:03----------
things why aren't substances like just


---------101:05----------
more or less addictive you know and so


---------101:09----------
the individuality it turns out is born


---------101:11----------
in in neuroscience


---------101:12----------
so are you forea like what which


---------101:17----------
substance creates a sense of euphoria in


---------101:19----------
our brain is actually like dependent on


---------101:22----------
our biology so some people like our


---------101:25----------
brain sort of lights up like a Christmas


---------101:26----------
trees with some people with alcohol some


---------101:28----------
people with opiates some people with


---------101:30----------
marijuana some people with


---------101:31----------
methamphetamine some people with video


---------101:33----------
games some people with other things so


---------101:36----------
there is a biological component but that


---------101:38----------
they they seem to be specific to the


---------101:39----------
substance so what I believe so that is


---------101:42----------
kind of like a counter-argument to like


---------101:44----------
a genetic predisposition from alcohol to


---------101:46----------
video game addiction what I think makes


---------101:49----------
a lot more sense there may be some


---------101:50----------
component fact there probably is but


---------101:52----------
what I think is a lot more accurate is


---------101:54----------
when I talk to people they actually have


---------101:56----------
this pattern quite commonly which is


---------101:59----------
that they just fundamentally are like


---------102:01----------
not confident in the person that they


---------102:03----------
are and you can kind of like with many


---------102:05----------
people I'll sort of dig into things like


---------102:07----------
bullying and stuff like that but like I


---------102:08----------
mean everyone [ __ ] gets bullied come


---------102:10----------
on like most people get bullied and not


---------102:12----------
everyone turns into a video game addict


---------102:14----------
or at least not of this severity so the


---------102:15----------
question is like why do you turn into a


---------102:17----------
video game addict in my sense is that


---------102:19----------
you know the the you need a bigger tank


---------102:23----------
for like a bigger boss and the bigger


---------102:26----------
your pit is the more planks that you


---------102:28----------
need to cover it and so people who get


---------102:31----------
very very addicted to video games have


---------102:34----------
actually like a bigger pit or they're


---------102:36----------
dealing with like more and more


---------102:38----------
uncertainty and if you think about it


---------102:40----------
what is it what does the video game give


---------102:42----------
you it gives you certainty like WoW is


---------102:44----------
the why do [ __ ] people why do people


---------102:46----------
play Wow over and over and over and over


---------102:48----------
again it's because it's the same damn


---------102:50----------
thing every single time there's no


---------102:53----------
uncertainty so you can be confident in


---------102:56----------
what happens with Wow


---------102:58----------
but that's the way the game is designed


---------102:59----------
it's like you're great you can be


---------103:01----------
confident in what happens and so I think


---------103:04----------
that this issue of lack of confidence


---------103:06----------
about how the way the world works is


---------103:08----------
very common with gamers and so


---------103:10----------
uncertainty becomes very very like


---------103:13----------
damaging to them and what do I mean by


---------103:15----------
that


---------103:16----------
there are a lot of people who like let


---------103:19----------
me just give you an example of how


---------103:21----------
uncertainty is completely unacceptable


---------103:22----------
for gamers if there's gamers will avoid


---------103:26----------
doing anything unless they're sure it's


---------103:28----------
going to help them just think about this


---------103:30----------
for a second I'm not gonna apply to a


---------103:32----------
[ __ ] job unless I know I'm gonna get


---------103:33----------
it I'm not gonna apply to school unless


---------103:35----------
I know I'm gonna get in I'm not gonna


---------103:38----------
ask someone out unless I know they say


---------103:39----------
yes so just think about that you have an


---------103:42----------
aversion and most people are not like


---------103:46----------
that


---------103:46----------
right like most people like basically


---------103:48----------
understand that not everything is gonna


---------103:49----------
work out for you so the question is why


---------103:51----------
are gamers so averse to uncertainty and


---------103:55----------
I think it's because some of them grow


---------103:57----------
up in an environment where like there's


---------103:59----------
very little order and so you learn how


---------104:01----------
to like get really scared of like


---------104:04----------
disorder and you start gravitating


---------104:06----------
towards like order any place that you


---------104:08----------
can find it and what a video game really


---------104:11----------
gives you is like order because in a


---------104:12----------
game you know what you're gonna get and


---------104:14----------
the thing that paralyzes gamers so much


---------104:17----------
from moving forward is a lack a sense of


---------104:20----------
uncertainty about what the outcome is so


---------104:22----------
they would rather


---------104:31----------
you


---------104:39----------
see this is what happens every time


---------104:41----------
is this working okay so every time I say


---------104:44----------
something profound either discord cuts


---------104:45----------
out or twitch stop streaming or I knock


---------104:47----------
out yeah so let me explain something to


---------104:51----------
you gamers would rather how can I say


---------104:56----------
they would how can I say this they would


---------104:59----------
rather spend they would rather waste all


---------105:02----------
of their hours how can I say this you're


---------105:10----------
completely fine wasting time playing


---------105:12----------
video games with a 0% chance of success


---------105:15----------
you'd rather do that then have a 50%


---------105:19----------
chance of success and waste time doing


---------105:21----------
something that like may not work out


---------105:23----------
right like gamers are more comfortable


---------105:25----------
with a 0% chance of success than they


---------105:28----------
are with like a 50% chance of success


---------105:30----------
it's [ __ ] weird it's bizarre right


---------105:34----------
you would rather waste your time playing


---------105:36----------
video games all day long rather than


---------105:39----------
waste your time on an application that


---------105:41----------
may not work out you would rather give


---------105:44----------
yourself a 0% chance of success and


---------105:46----------
waste your life rather than do something


---------105:49----------
that may lead to success but you're not


---------105:52----------
gonna choose that you [ __ ] hate it


---------105:54----------
it's bizarre you think that human beings


---------105:58----------
would choose the thing that leads to the


---------105:59----------
greatest probabilistic chance of success


---------106:01----------
which is that apply to a lot of things


---------106:03----------
but bizarrely that's not how we work


---------106:06----------
we're like no screw that if there's a


---------106:08----------
chance it's not gonna work I'd rather


---------106:10----------
not do it at all and I'm gonna waste all


---------106:12----------
my time over here and said give me as


---------106:14----------
give me a hundred percent chance for


---------106:17----------
zero success as opposed to a 50% chance


---------106:20----------
for 50% success that's what I'm trying


---------106:24----------
to say it's a weird mathematical formula


---------106:26----------
but that's what I've observed right it's


---------106:31----------
bizarre and I don't know where exactly


---------106:34----------
this comes from but I think it has


---------106:36----------
something to do fundamentally with the


---------106:38----------
way that we're wired and I think that


---------106:40----------
has something fundamentally to do with


---------106:42----------
the way that we're raised


---------106:43----------
so we're taught to be like very very


---------106:46----------
scared of disorder from a young age and


---------106:48----------
if you think about what conf


---------106:50----------
the definition of confidence is being


---------106:52----------
able to face uncertainty right that's


---------106:54----------
what confidence is


---------106:55----------
gamers are not interested in confidence


---------106:58----------
that you guys don't want confidence what


---------106:59----------
you want is guarantees and we sometimes


---------107:02----------
we conflate those two right we say that


---------107:04----------
like a guarantee like no guarantees and


---------107:07----------
confidence our opposite ends of the


---------107:08----------
spectrum the more guarantees you have


---------107:11----------
the less confident you need to be and so


---------107:16----------
like this is really bizarre but you guys


---------107:17----------
actually don't want confidence you don't


---------107:19----------
look for confidence you want a scenario


---------107:22----------
where confidence is unnecessary that's


---------107:25----------
what you look for and that's what


---------107:27----------
paralyzes you because fundamentally


---------107:28----------
that's not possible


---------107:30----------
newsflash the world is full of


---------107:32----------
uncertainty but here comes [ __ ] video


---------107:35----------
games and they come to your brain and


---------107:37----------
they're like hey brain you guys don't


---------107:40----------
need to deal with uncertainty you can


---------107:41----------
get progress in accomplishment if you do


---------107:44----------
this you can come to me and you can play


---------107:46----------
every single day and you can get


---------107:48----------
progress progress and accomplishment and


---------107:50----------
pride in a sense of growth without


---------107:54----------
dealing with any of that uncertainty and


---------107:56----------
then your brain is like well [ __ ] I'm


---------108:00----------
not going to deal with uncertainty like


---------108:01----------
screw that let me let me get everything


---------108:04----------
that I need with a guarantee like I'll


---------108:06----------
take the guarantee over the uncertainty


---------108:07----------
any day of the week and that's that's


---------108:13----------
what I think is going on so I think that


---------108:15----------
what you guys really need to do is


---------108:17----------
understand that like the life if you


---------108:19----------
want to move forward in life which you


---------108:21----------
should really do is embrace uncertainty


---------108:23----------
that uncertainty is like is how you get


---------108:26----------
you move forward so I think a lot of my


---------108:29----------
my success has been through actually


---------108:33----------
choosing the uncertain path over the


---------108:35----------
certain path it's walking away from


---------108:38----------
opportunities not taking them so when I


---------108:41----------
have like a set job to you know be a


---------108:43----------
clinician it at Harvard Medical School


---------108:45----------
they're gonna give me that job and it's


---------108:47----------
gonna be a great job and then you walk


---------108:50----------
away and if I if I hadn't walked away


---------108:52----------
from that job I mean I'm still clinical


---------108:54----------
faculty so I still teach but if I hadn't


---------108:56----------
walked away from the job healthy gamer


---------108:57----------
would wouldn't exist today because I


---------108:59----------
wouldn't have had time because I would


---------109:01----------
have been an employee with a boss


---------109:03----------
so walking away from great opportunities


---------109:05----------
and facing uncertainty I think is a


---------109:07----------
wonderful way to move forward in life


---------109:08----------
but you've got to understand that like


---------109:11----------
it's gonna be a [ __ ] show like I didn't


---------109:12----------
know that healthy game was gonna happen


---------109:15----------
right so like you not you're not gonna


---------109:18----------
know and this is the other crazy thing


---------109:21----------
is that you guys try to create so many


---------109:22----------
expectations about what you want your


---------109:24----------
life to be that you guys don't even


---------109:26----------
grasp that your brain does not even know


---------109:30----------
what you're capable of think about that


---------109:34----------
for a second when you think about what


---------109:36----------
your future can hold you are such a poor


---------109:40----------
judge for like what you're capable of


---------109:42----------
because you have so little experience in


---------109:44----------
the real world and this is the big


---------109:46----------
problem is you guys all lent aim way too


---------109:48----------
low like I'm telling you guys I will


---------109:50----------
take a 26 year old who has never had a


---------109:52----------
job in his life and I will drop him in


---------109:55----------
an MIT startup and he will do phenomenal


---------109:57----------
with no work experience he'll just learn


---------110:02----------
he'll like he'll go on wiki and like


---------110:05----------
he'll go on Wikipedia and he'll like


---------110:07----------
learn how to code and he'll learn how to


---------110:08----------
problem solve and he'll learn Stata and


---------110:11----------
statistics because that's what you guys


---------110:13----------
do right like if you look at scott scott


---------110:15----------
plays Wow for 20 hours a day he knows


---------110:17----------
the game in and out and and like if if


---------110:22----------
you guys get challenged and you stop


---------110:26----------
caring about like guarantees of success


---------110:28----------
and you can just abandon all that crap


---------110:31----------
and this is what I was telling Scott is


---------110:32----------
like in terms of the dirty water and the


---------110:34----------
clean water you guys are so concerned


---------110:36----------
about success and failure you guys are


---------110:37----------
neither of those things


---------110:38----------
you're the rag if you just abandoned the


---------110:41----------
idea of success and failure and you just


---------110:44----------
do something it's the results have like


---------110:47----------
almost always been amazing I haven't I


---------110:50----------
haven't been just I've been I mean


---------110:52----------
people haven't some people haven't done


---------110:54----------
well but I haven't been disappointed in


---------110:56----------
them even if they don't do well so


---------110:59----------
anyway it is difficult to find something


---------111:03----------
you actually enjoy doing though yes I


---------111:05----------
completely agree it is difficult to find


---------111:07----------
something that you actually enjoy the


---------111:09----------
problem is that most people don't their


---------111:12----------
search for things that they enjoy


---------111:15----------
happens up here


---------111:17----------
instead of with their hands you guys


---------111:20----------
when you think about when you find you


---------111:22----------
don't find what you enjoy you think


---------111:24----------
about what you may enjoy and you let


---------111:27----------
that control whether you act think about


---------111:32----------
it for a second where do you make the


---------111:34----------
determination about what you are going


---------111:36----------
to enjoy do you make it up here or do


---------111:38----------
you make it in the outside world and how


---------111:40----------
good of a judge is this depending on


---------111:42----------
what you're gonna enjoy think about it


---------111:48----------
right so this is exactly what I'm saying


---------111:51----------
you guys in terms of the solution space


---------111:53----------
that you create for yourself it is so


---------111:55----------
narrow because you guys have no idea


---------111:57----------
what you enjoy you have no clue because


---------112:02----------
you guys don't do anything you live in


---------112:04----------
here and that's not just a bad I mean


---------112:07----------
like in this case it's a bad thing but


---------112:08----------
this is what I'm telling you guys you


---------112:10----------
guys have spent so much time living in


---------112:11----------
here that like we live in a world where


---------112:14----------
like this working really well is


---------112:16----------
actually the most important part of your


---------112:17----------
success in the real world this and so if


---------112:21----------
you actually find yourself in a job that


---------112:24----------
you enjoy this [ __ ] is levelled up so


---------112:27----------
much that you guys are gonna do an


---------112:29----------
amazing job because you've leveled this


---------112:31----------
up the problem is this can't fix


---------112:33----------
everything so you just need to level up


---------112:35----------
your like IRL skills a little bit and


---------112:37----------
then unleash that's really the best word


---------112:40----------
that I can think of I feel like I'm


---------112:42----------
unleashing gamers into like certain


---------112:44----------
areas it's like they're like a [ __ ]


---------112:46----------
tornado and they just own it


---------112:49----------
one last story I'll share with you guys


---------112:51----------
okay I was taking a class called


---------112:54----------
value-based healthcare at Harvard


---------112:56----------
Business School so this is a class where


---------112:58----------
there were a hundred or so physicians


---------113:00----------
throughout the Harvard Medical School


---------113:02----------
training program who took a class so


---------113:07----------
Harvard and E Harvard and E Harvard and


---------113:08----------
E and I'm using that reason that this


---------113:10----------
phrase for reason right at HBS so these


---------113:13----------
are a bunch of [ __ ] try-hards who are


---------113:15----------
very accomplished and we had an


---------113:17----------
assignment the assignment was optimize


---------113:20----------
patient flow through a urology clinic so


---------113:24----------
urology is is like the subspecialty of


---------113:27----------
medicine that deals with the genital


---------113:28----------
tract and also like yeah


---------113:31----------
the euro general detract sorry not


---------113:33----------
general trying but you're a general so


---------113:35----------
it's like you're in stuff like bladder


---------113:36----------
urethra all that kind of stuff they also


---------113:39----------
deal with like a rectal dysfunction and


---------113:40----------
stuff like that and so like they have


---------113:43----------
some procedures right so that sometimes


---------113:44----------
they have to like inject dyes and take


---------113:46----------
x-rays and stuff like that so patients


---------113:48----------
that come to your all adji clinic and


---------113:49----------
it's like kind of complicated it's not


---------113:50----------
like psychiatry will you come and you


---------113:51----------
just talk to someone then you leave you


---------113:53----------
have to like get prepped by a nurse the


---------113:55----------
the doctor has to do a procedure


---------113:56----------
some people need procedures some people


---------113:58----------
don't need procedures some people need


---------113:59----------
perhaps some people don't need prep so


---------114:01----------
it's like a complicated situation where


---------114:03----------
you don't know what the patient's needs


---------114:04----------
are so you don't know how many like how


---------114:06----------
many nurses do you need how many doctors


---------114:07----------
do you need how many rooms do you need


---------114:09----------
how many rooms with equipment do you


---------114:11----------
need how many like offices do you need


---------114:12----------
with four just consultations where you


---------114:14----------
talk about medications it's kind of


---------114:15----------
complicated


---------114:16----------
so that our task was to optimize


---------114:20----------
optimize flow through urology clinic so


---------114:23----------
I I log on to discord and I turn to a


---------114:25----------
couple of buddies of mine who are all


---------114:27----------
meet I'm like hey guys I have this task


---------114:29----------
like do you guys want to help me try to


---------114:30----------
figure this out I send them the case


---------114:32----------
it's like a case study so they work on


---------114:35----------
the case and they come back with


---------114:36----------
solutions they're like oh you should do


---------114:37----------
this this and this this is what I think


---------114:38----------
you should migrate next day I go to


---------114:40----------
class or next week I go to class and


---------114:41----------
then you know the professor's like what


---------114:45----------
are you so what do you guys think you


---------114:46----------
should do to optimize flow and then I


---------114:48----------
have my plagiarized answers from my


---------114:50----------
buddies on disk or I raised my hand and


---------114:51----------
I say I think we should do this this and


---------114:52----------
this for us is like fantastic those are


---------114:54----------
all wonderful ideas like I'm telling you


---------114:56----------
guys crazy right so what gamers are good


---------114:59----------
at is if you give you if you give them a


---------115:01----------
system and you tell them to optimize the


---------115:03----------
system they're good at that because


---------115:05----------
think about what you've changed what


---------115:07----------
you've trained yourself to do you


---------115:08----------
optimize Wow


---------115:09----------
you optimize fortnight you optimize


---------115:11----------
League of Legends you optimize dota you


---------115:13----------
optimize Final Fantasy Tactics you


---------115:17----------
optimize all kinds of stuff you guys are


---------115:20----------
great at optimizing and all you have to


---------115:22----------
do is just like like go like do you guys


---------115:24----------
realize like how bad people aren't


---------115:26----------
optimizing things in the real world like


---------115:27----------
people do stupid stuff all the time


---------115:29----------
which it's just mind-numbing lead um and


---------115:32----------
it feels my numbing lead um to me


---------115:33----------
because I'm an optimizer like y'all you


---------115:35----------
guys know what min maxing in D&D is like


---------115:37----------
we're good at min max you guys are good


---------115:39----------
at min maxing you're gonna be good at


---------115:40----------
like other stuff in the real world too


---------115:41----------
you just need the social skills and you


---------115:43----------
need to like apply for the job


---------115:45----------
to where people don't think you're an


---------115:46----------
[ __ ] when you tell them that you're


---------115:47----------
doing something dumb and you can


---------115:49----------
actually help a lot of people because


---------115:51----------
most people don't think like we do so


---------115:54----------
games train us to think in terms of


---------115:57----------
efficiency most people do one side quest


---------115:59----------
at a time they actually don't batch


---------116:01----------
they're side quests and do like a


---------116:03----------
circuit of stranglethorn Vail it's not


---------116:05----------
how they live life right and you have


---------116:08----------
like whole degrees and stuff that are


---------116:09----------
devoted to like fixing operations and


---------116:12----------
like streamlining operations and stuff


---------116:13----------
like that and I'm not saying that you


---------116:15----------
guys are as good as formal education but


---------116:17----------
you'd be surprised so I took a guy that


---------116:20----------
I was working with and hopefully he's


---------116:21----------
not watching but I told him that I


---------116:23----------
wanted to do economic analysis on


---------116:25----------
eSports so I told him that I want to


---------116:28----------
publish a paper about which eSports are


---------116:31----------
the most lucrative and which eSports are


---------116:34----------
the hardest to break into guys he's


---------116:37----------
never done anything like this before I


---------116:39----------
show him some data and I'm like hey like


---------116:41----------
this is how like do you know how to use


---------116:42----------
Excel he's like sort of and I'm like oh


---------116:44----------
okay like so this is what you do and


---------116:45----------
this is how you run the analysis here's


---------116:47----------
here's the analysis for one sport I want


---------116:49----------
you to take this and do nine other


---------116:51----------
eSports he's like okay and sure enough


---------116:55----------
he does a great job so don't


---------116:59----------
underestimate what you're capable of I


---------117:00----------
mean you guys do but that's just because


---------117:02----------
you just don't you don't I mean of


---------117:04----------
course you're gonna underestimate what


---------117:05----------
you're capable of because you have no


---------117:06----------
experience so your estimation is gonna


---------117:08----------
suck so go and get get yourself out


---------117:12----------
there try something and and just try


---------117:18----------
something you'll be amazed at where


---------117:19----------
you're capable I mean you just [ __ ]


---------117:20----------
try the other thing is that like Scott's


---------117:23----------
applying for one job every two weeks


---------117:25----------
like that's not how you get a job you


---------117:27----------
got to apply for like a hundred jobs


---------117:29----------
over the course of three months that's


---------117:30----------
how you got a job and then the other


---------117:32----------
problem is like you guys are applying


---------117:33----------
for one job every two weeks so like the


---------117:35----------
likelihood that you're gonna get a job


---------117:36----------
that you enjoy is gonna be low because


---------117:38----------
you only have one option so you guys are


---------117:41----------
concerned I say you guys I mean it


---------117:43----------
sounds like a [ __ ] boomer talking to


---------117:44----------
you yeah so just think about this for a


---------117:47----------
second a lot of gamers feel like they


---------117:49----------
need to find a job you guys don't need


---------117:51----------
to find a job finally job is dumb I


---------117:53----------
don't think you should find a job I


---------117:55----------
think you should find five jobs and then


---------117:58----------
I think you should pick


---------117:58----------
the best one but that's not the way that


---------118:01----------
you think and that's not the way that


---------118:02----------
you act you guys are so concerned about


---------118:05----------
finding a job that you do them yourself


---------118:08----------
to finding a shitty one


---------118:10----------
you should get five jobs you should


---------118:13----------
increase the number of places you apply


---------118:14----------
by a hundred and then you should be


---------118:17----------
selective about what you want you guys


---------118:21----------
think that life is not giving you


---------118:23----------
anything so you're willing to take the


---------118:24----------
table scraps from your shitty efforts


---------118:26----------
and instead like put forth some effort


---------118:29----------
and then get something that you enjoy


---------118:31----------
doing it's actually doable it's not that


---------118:34----------
crazy


---------118:35----------
but that's just not how we think like


---------118:39----------
apply for weight like you guys get this


---------118:42----------
your problem is not you need a job your


---------118:44----------
problem is like you should get like 30


---------118:46----------
offers of acceptance and then the other


---------118:48----------
problem that you guys make is when you


---------118:50----------
get a job what do you stop doing you


---------118:52----------
stop applying that's dumb that's just so


---------118:59----------
dumb why would you stop applying for


---------119:02----------
jobs just because you have one you're


---------119:03----------
completely missing the point you don't


---------119:05----------
know what you're gonna like two weeks


---------119:06----------
from now sorry I mean I'm not it like


---------119:11----------
I'm the same I was the same way so this


---------119:13----------
is the way that I think now it's like


---------119:16----------
just pause and think about this right so


---------119:19----------
like don't accept how can I say this


---------119:22----------
don't accept the walk through that the


---------119:26----------
boomer generation has given you create


---------119:30----------
your own walk through because the walk


---------119:32----------
through from the boomer generation which


---------119:34----------
is they say hey kid you don't have a job


---------119:36----------
you need a job that walkthrough doesn't


---------119:39----------
work for us that's why the world is like


---------119:41----------
that's why everything is [ __ ] because


---------119:43----------
the Boomers gave us a walkthrough and


---------119:45----------
they're like this is how you be


---------119:46----------
successful in life that walkthrough


---------119:48----------
doesn't work anymore


---------119:49----------
we've got to come up with our own


---------119:51----------
solutions and our own solutions are


---------119:53----------
gonna be different and we don't have to


---------119:55----------
work hard like their walkthrough is like


---------119:56----------
work hard and you'll be successful in


---------119:58----------
life that's a dumb


---------119:59----------
that's a dumb walk through don't do that


---------120:02----------
I'm lazy


---------120:02----------
you guys are lazy that's fine like the


---------120:07----------
solution is not apply for one job get


---------120:09----------
one job and then work your ass up to


---------120:11----------
manage


---------120:12----------
position even though you don't like it


---------120:13----------
what I'm saying is front-load your work


---------120:16----------
so you can be a lazy [ __ ] down the


---------120:18----------
road find the job in IT where your


---------120:22----------
bosses don't understand what you do


---------120:25----------
where they don't understand like that


---------120:27----------
you can write a script to do your job


---------120:29----------
for you and you can sit there in the


---------120:31----------
back and just like run your script to


---------120:33----------
automate things like people don't


---------120:36----------
understand that you can run scripts to


---------120:37----------
do things they think that like the stuff


---------120:39----------
has to be done manually like data entry


---------120:40----------
that gets done manually right and then


---------120:43----------
like the cool thing about that is once


---------120:45----------
you realize like I want you guys to try


---------120:47----------
to optimize and maximize your laziness


---------120:49----------
all you guys sorry for saying all you


---------120:52----------
guys all you guys are like oh I'm so


---------120:53----------
lazy I'm so undisciplined like yeah so


---------120:57----------
don't try to change don't try to be


---------120:59----------
something that you're not this is were


---------121:00----------
the Eastern philosophy or Eastern


---------121:02----------
philosophy me what you are Oh be present


---------121:05----------
accept accept who you are Oh


---------121:10----------
enlightenment Yoga Buddha Oh


---------121:13----------
Oh be where you are you guys need to


---------121:16----------
really listen to that for a second it's


---------121:18----------
not for yoga hippies it's for you what


---------121:20----------
that means is be lazy be lazy try to be


---------121:25----------
the laziest person that you can but make


---------121:28----------
it work for you don't try to be don't


---------121:31----------
don't look don't do the boomer


---------121:32----------
walkthrough don't do the boomer


---------121:34----------
walkthrough don't work hard that's not


---------121:36----------
the way you become successful the way


---------121:39----------
you become successful is by adding value


---------121:41----------
not adding effort think about this for a


---------121:44----------
second okay what is value how do we


---------121:46----------
define value does anybody know what is


---------121:50----------
the mathematical definition of value how


---------121:58----------
do you define value no incorrect value


---------122:01----------
equals value incorrect isn't value an


---------122:05----------
effort the same absolutely incorrect


---------122:12----------
value is the result it is it's on one


---------122:15----------
side of the equal sign what is on the


---------122:17----------
other side of the equal sign work


---------122:20----------
divided by time incorrect output minus


---------122:25----------
input sort of value equals time no no


---------122:33----------
see this is the basic problem yeah so so


---------122:37----------
one i'm see couple people get it effort


---------122:39----------
over time sort of you guys are getting


---------122:42----------
closer I'll tell you so value equals


---------122:44----------
yield divided by effort right high value


---------122:48----------
things give you a lot of stuff for a


---------122:50----------
little investment that's the definition


---------122:52----------
of value so like if we think about like


---------122:55----------
a high value pair of shoes gives me a


---------122:58----------
lot of walked miles divided by the cost


---------123:01----------
of the shoes just think about that for a


---------123:05----------
second value so high value in health


---------123:07----------
care so there's like this value base to


---------123:10----------
healthcare delivery course that I was


---------123:11----------
telling you guys about what does have


---------123:14----------
value in health care is like amount of


---------123:17----------
sickness improved divided by cost of


---------123:20----------
delivering care do you guys get that so


---------123:23----------
it's like yield divided by cost and so


---------123:27----------
if you guys want to have high value what


---------123:30----------
that means is that your effort can be


---------123:32----------
low that's the goal so if you guys are


---------123:36----------
lazy that's perfectly acceptable


---------123:38----------
optimize that in fact all of health care


---------123:41----------
in the u.s. right now is trying to


---------123:43----------
become lazier they're trying to reduce


---------123:45----------
the cost or the effort that you put in


---------123:47----------
and get more out of the like clinical


---------123:50----------
outcomes that you receive does that make


---------123:55----------
sense so be lazy just figure out how to


---------123:59----------
make laziness work don't try to not be


---------124:00----------
lazy dumb sorry for calling guys dump


---------124:04----------
but it is dumb it's like dumb I was dumb


---------124:06----------
I mean I'm still dumb probably like 10


---------124:09----------
years from now I'm gonna be sighs saying


---------124:11----------
something else about how stupid I was


---------124:12----------
before I was like oh I was so dumb like


---------124:14----------
I was telling people to be lazy like how


---------124:16----------
[ __ ] dumb is that so grow fine let's


---------124:21----------
say grow so I encourage you guys to


---------124:23----------
challenge yourself about


---------124:25----------
thinking about like how can you be as


---------124:26----------
lazy as possible this is your homework


---------124:29----------
for today okay and think about how many


---------124:32----------
jobs you need to apply to to maximize


---------124:35----------
your laziness think about that the more


---------124:39----------
jobs do you apply to does that increase


---------124:41----------
your capacity to be lazy over the next


---------124:43----------
year or decrease the capacity to be lazy


---------124:45----------
over the next year right so think about


---------124:54----------
it answer 0 fine effort zero values


---------124:59----------
infinity absolutely just be homeless no


---------125:03----------
don't just be homeless that's dumb I


---------125:06----------
mean if you are homeless I that's


---------125:08----------
unfortunate I'm not calling you stupid


---------125:09----------
but what I'm saying is that like just


---------125:11----------
think think a little bit about how


---------125:12----------
you're living your life and think about


---------125:14----------
if you can live it differently because I


---------125:16----------
still maintain that most of change in


---------125:18----------
life I know this sounds crazy it's not


---------125:20----------
through effort I mean it does it does


---------125:22----------
require effort but it's not through work


---------125:24----------
so I think the effort is actually up


---------125:26----------
here I think the effort is an increase


---------125:29----------
in intentionality so I sketched out like


---------125:32----------
anyway I'm gonna get off on another


---------125:34----------
channel tension I got to stop so I'm


---------125:36----------
sorry that we don't have time for


---------125:37----------
meditation but I want you guys to just


---------125:39----------
think about what we've talked about


---------125:41----------
today and try to think about how to


---------125:43----------
apply it to your own life like actually


---------125:45----------
like stop and reflect on it think about


---------125:48----------
how can you insert these principles into


---------125:50----------
your own life and whether they apply to


---------125:52----------
you or not and one of the biggest


---------125:55----------
biggest lessons that I learned is that I


---------125:57----------
know that we're all about


---------125:58----------
procrastinating and like not like


---------126:00----------
pushing back things but generally


---------126:03----------
speaking if you really want to be lazy


---------126:05----------
in life the solution is to front-load


---------126:06----------
your work for an optimal like setup down


---------126:10----------
the road that's really what it's about


---------126:13----------
all right so all these people who like


---------126:15----------
bought alter act valley like they're


---------126:17----------
there they're doing it right like you


---------126:18----------
can do you don't think that you can


---------126:19----------
bought real life like you can absolutely


---------126:21----------
bought real life absolutely do things


---------126:23----------
that increase your efficiency and like


---------126:25----------
make it like a lot of people are working


---------126:27----------
for stuff and you can just automate it


---------126:29----------
right so like this I mean we we've


---------126:32----------
automated a lot of stuff recently we're


---------126:33----------
trying to create workflows and you try


---------126:35----------
to think about it that balance seems


---------126:38----------
very hard to find you


---------126:39----------
very right it is very hard to find so oh


---------126:43----------
I forgot for a second if it's hard to do


---------126:46----------
you guys are just not gonna do it right


---------126:49----------
hard and impossible can be the same to a


---------126:52----------
gamer I'll leave you guys with that


---------126:55----------
thought and take care of guys so we're


---------127:00----------
gonna try to focus on this webinar a


---------127:02----------
couple of things so by the way a lot of


---------127:04----------
this stuff for those of you who have


---------127:06----------
supported us we are very very grateful


---------127:09----------
so we're gonna try to turn some of that


---------127:11----------
into a webinar and yeah I think right


---------127:15----------
now we're I don't know exactly how the


---------127:19----------
cost structure is gonna work I think


---------127:20----------
we're gonna try to make it free


---------127:22----------
hopefully I don't shoot myself in the


---------127:23----------
foot for that we're gonna see if there's


---------127:26----------
some way that we can swing a suggested


---------127:27----------
donation or maybe how people just


---------127:30----------
support us through patreon or something


---------127:31----------
like that we really don't want to charge


---------127:33----------
for it we may have to and if we do


---------127:35----------
charge for it it's gonna be like super


---------127:36----------
cheap but it's just we're gonna have to


---------127:39----------
figure out what our investment is and


---------127:41----------
and things like that but I think we're


---------127:43----------
getting a lot of support through streams


---------127:44----------
so I'm really really grateful for that


---------127:45----------
nor hope is to try to build this content


---------127:47----------
definitely what's coming out is YouTube


---------127:49----------
videos on a lot of this stuff so I have


---------127:51----------
there's one I'll just share with you one


---------127:53----------
guys one thing that I'm thinking about


---------127:54----------
oh yeah


---------127:56----------
so here's here's I want to do a video


---------127:57----------
about this what's the difference between


---------128:02----------
half-assing something and doing


---------128:04----------
something good enough and what's the


---------128:06----------
difference between waste and sacrifice


---------128:15----------
right so that's something that we're


---------128:17----------
doing a video about does that make sense


---------128:21----------
I think about that for a second


---------128:28----------
lots of answers lots and lots of answers


---------128:30----------
so what's the difference between


---------128:32----------
half-assing something and doing


---------128:34----------
something good enough and what's the


---------128:38----------
difference between waste and sacrifice


---------128:48----------
right so think about this stuff and then


---------128:51----------
the next question is is it important to


---------128:54----------
understand what the difference between


---------128:56----------
these two things are that's even a more


---------128:58----------
important question so these questions


---------128:59----------
that I asked like what's the value of me


---------129:01----------
like asking this stuff what do you think


---------129:06----------
do you think it'll change I mean I hope


---------129:09----------
that it'll change your life and I hope


---------129:11----------
it'll change your life because you'll


---------129:12----------
understand the difference between those


---------129:13----------
two things and hopefully you'll do one


---------129:15----------
instead of the other and and like so my


---------129:19----------
life has been changed through like


---------129:20----------
answering questions like this like I


---------129:22----------
really want y'all to understand this my


---------129:24----------
life has not been changed through


---------129:25----------
working harder it's been changed through


---------129:28----------
like understanding concepts and systems


---------129:31----------
that's like a no-brainer right like if


---------129:34----------
you guys see you know if you see like


---------129:36----------
speed runs like someone who does a


---------129:38----------
speedrun doesn't work harder than


---------129:41----------
someone who plays the game at a slow


---------129:43----------
pace what's the difference between a


---------129:45----------
speedrun and like a noob who plays the


---------129:47----------
game in fact the noob exerts a lot more


---------129:49----------
effort right like what exactly


---------129:59----------
proficiency optimization knowledge that


---------130:03----------
is the difference and the funny thing is


---------130:06----------
that the speed runner actually beats the


---------130:09----------
game and a fraction of the time is the


---------130:11----------
noob and so just think about that


---------130:15----------
knowledge is sufficient to actually


---------130:16----------
change your life for the better


---------130:18----------
absolutely you cannot teach experience I


---------130:23----------
completely agree but I can ask you guys


---------130:25----------
questions and you can reflect on them


---------130:28----------
and then you can gain understanding I


---------130:29----------
can't teach understanding either I can


---------130:32----------
give you information and that's part of


---------130:33----------
the reason that what I try to do is ask


---------130:35----------
questions and make statements that are


---------130:37----------
provocative from a thinking perspective


---------130:39----------
as my goal here is not to teach you my


---------130:41----------
goal here is to make you think because I


---------130:45----------
can give you guys all the answers and


---------130:47----------
it's not going to change you like the


---------130:48----------
goal is for you to think because that


---------130:50----------
also has to do with behavioral change


---------130:52----------
and how the brain works and stuff like


---------130:53----------
that right I'm not asking you guys to


---------130:55----------
memorize multiplication tables I'm


---------130:58----------
asking you guys to learn how to multiply


---------130:59----------
and I can I can


---------131:02----------
demonstrate multiplication tables I


---------131:03----------
cannot teach you how to multiply


---------131:05----------
multiplication is something you have to


---------131:06----------
learn and understand on your own


---------131:08----------
right do you guys get that I can't


---------131:09----------
transmit the knowledge of multiplication


---------131:11----------
to you as a concept that's the goal


---------131:15----------
anyway thank you guys very much we'll


---------131:22----------
see you all on when Wednesday


---------131:23----------
