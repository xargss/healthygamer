---------00:07----------

---------00:09----------
call you amaranth or is that


---------00:12----------
kate is fine kate yes okay um thanks for


---------00:16----------
coming on kate


---------00:18----------
uh yeah it was nice to meet you a couple


---------00:19----------
weeks ago on the scuffed podcast


---------00:22----------
i watched your stream from time to time


---------00:24----------
uh but it was really cool to hear your


---------00:26----------
perspectives on


---------00:27----------
kind of mental health so thanks very


---------00:29----------
much for sharing those


---------00:31----------
no problem i think i'm going to have you


---------00:33----------
on my screen too so if you need to crop


---------00:35----------
my window so that you're not shown twice


---------00:38----------
then you can do that if possible


---------00:41----------
okay um thanks for letting me know that


---------00:43----------
you were doing that so


---------00:45----------
and it's kate you said yes and what did


---------00:48----------
you


---------00:49----------
so i saw that our topic today was going


---------00:51----------
to be something about social media


---------00:55----------
yeah i was thinking just more of like


---------00:57----------
the various effects


---------00:59----------
that social media from the creator side


---------01:02----------
can have


---------01:03----------
on the mentality of the streamer or


---------01:05----------
youtube or whatever it is


---------01:07----------
yeah i'd love to hear your perspectives


---------01:09----------
on that


---------01:10----------
yeah well i'm saying something i've


---------01:12----------
noticed for me personally i think the


---------01:14----------
biggest


---------01:15----------
change with social media is like i feel


---------01:18----------
like


---------01:18----------
i don't have as much personality as i


---------01:20----------
did before i started streaming you know


---------01:22----------
like day in and day out it's like


---------01:24----------
because i guess everything's so


---------01:25----------
monotonous


---------01:26----------
that i feel like i no longer partake in


---------01:29----------
the activities that made me me


---------01:31----------
that's kind of frightening a little bit


---------01:34----------
to say that you


---------01:35----------
like no like have less personality or no


---------01:38----------
longer have personality


---------01:40----------
yeah it's like really weird it's like i


---------01:42----------
guess for smiling it's a lot harder for


---------01:43----------
me to do that like i used to


---------01:45----------
like i just noticed in myself like i


---------01:47----------
guess less bubbly because i used to do


---------01:49----------
like disney princess parties and stuff


---------01:51----------
for kids birthdays before i started


---------01:53----------
streaming and that became like something


---------01:55----------
that was like a part of my like normal


---------01:56----------
identity too where i was just smiling


---------01:58----------
all the time


---------01:59----------
you know i was like positive person and


---------02:01----------
i guess like social media


---------02:03----------
i've noticed that physically my mouth


---------02:05----------
doesn't feel as comfortable smiling so i


---------02:07----------
don't do it as much


---------02:08----------
you know i'm hearing emotion in your


---------02:11----------
voice


---------02:13----------
yeah yeah i'm a very emotional person


---------02:14----------
too


---------02:16----------
do you mind if i ask what you're feeling


---------02:17----------
right now as you say that


---------02:21----------
concern okay what are you concerned


---------02:24----------
about


---------02:27----------
how to like keep that balance right


---------02:30----------
because i think that's like the biggest


---------02:31----------
problem i found


---------02:32----------
is chasing long-term happiness as like


---------02:34----------
goal-oriented for being a social media


---------02:36----------
person like what i want to achieve in


---------02:37----------
life


---------02:38----------
versus like short-term mental


---------02:41----------
like happiness i guess like short-term


---------02:43----------
indulgences versus like keeping the


---------02:45----------
grind up to achieve long-term


---------02:48----------
dreams if that makes sense yeah it does


---------02:51----------
make sense you know usually i say this


---------02:53----------
later but can i think for a second yeah


---------02:56----------
go for it because i'm hearing a lot of


---------02:57----------
important stuff


---------02:58----------
from what you're saying kate um yeah and


---------03:01----------
don't


---------03:02----------
don't get like too concerned if i sound


---------03:03----------
emotional part of my problem is i can't


---------03:05----------
breathe very well so like


---------03:06----------
i get over anxiety feelings much easier


---------03:09----------
than normal people i guess


---------03:11----------
so i have a breathing issue so like i


---------03:12----------
can't breathe deeply when talking about


---------03:14----------
things


---------03:15----------
so i just like sound like i'm about to


---------03:16----------
cry but like emotionally i feel okay


---------03:18----------
oh okay that's useful to know so


---------03:22----------
um


---------03:30----------
i'm curious about your breathing issues


---------03:31----------
but i i think that's more on the medical


---------03:34----------
side


---------03:35----------
yeah it's it's just something i notice


---------03:36----------
that if i like stop and i breathe


---------03:38----------
and then that the waiver in the voice


---------03:40----------
fades but like if i keep going in a


---------03:42----------
sentence without breathing it's just


---------03:43----------
it just sounds really bad yeah it sounds


---------03:46----------
worse than it actually is


---------03:47----------
how long have you been breathing like


---------03:49----------
that


---------03:50----------
um i guess my whole life has been


---------03:52----------
deviated but it's gotten worse i've


---------03:53----------
gotten older


---------03:54----------
because i think the cartilage is like


---------03:56----------
growing against my favor


---------03:58----------
you know just as my nose ages


---------04:02----------
interesting something i have to fix soon


---------04:03----------
but that's like another issue is like


---------04:05----------
scheduling time to get things like that


---------04:07----------
fixed when it would take like a hiatus


---------04:09----------
from social media and losing that


---------04:10----------
momentum and stuff


---------04:11----------
okay so it sounds like there's really a


---------04:13----------
cost to taking care of yourself


---------04:16----------
yeah exactly yeah i'm


---------04:21----------
you know not to sound bleak kate but i'm


---------04:23----------
almost like


---------04:25----------
hearing that you're kind of losing a


---------04:27----------
part of yourself


---------04:30----------
yeah i agree um i mean that's


---------04:34----------
[ __ ] frightening you know


---------04:37----------
and and so what and by the way disney


---------04:40----------
princess party sound awesome i think my


---------04:41----------
kids would


---------04:42----------
absolutely love that they wear um


---------04:46----------
they have we got them elsa costumes for


---------04:49----------
halloween like


---------04:51----------
two years ago yeah yeah


---------04:54----------
maybe one year ago it's it's rusty now


---------04:57----------
but and they wear them like once a week


---------05:01----------
like my older kid will just be like


---------05:03----------
today is an elsa costume day and she'll


---------05:05----------
just like


---------05:06----------
at 12 30 yeah she'll just like it you


---------05:09----------
know after lunch she'll go


---------05:11----------
upstairs to her room and she'll actually


---------05:14----------
like change and then she'll fold her


---------05:15----------
clothes and put them away


---------05:16----------
which is really awesome i mean because


---------05:18----------
she doesn't leave the mask she used to


---------05:19----------
leave the mess but she'll just like


---------05:21----------
today is an elsa costume kind of day and


---------05:22----------
it's not really a costume it's just like


---------05:24----------
she just puts on her elster dress


---------05:26----------
best halloween costume money we've ever


---------05:28----------
spent


---------05:29----------
oh yeah yeah they love that stuff i used


---------05:31----------
to do it like every weekend so


---------05:32----------
i saw all the dresses all the kids built


---------05:35----------
the songs it was like a really like


---------05:36----------
really fun wholesome time yeah and


---------05:39----------
and i i guess tell me about what that


---------05:43----------
person was like


---------05:44----------
the person who did those kinds of things


---------05:48----------
can you tell me i guess that kind of


---------05:49----------
thing it wasn't so much that like


---------05:52----------
i was different in the way i was thought


---------05:54----------
about things but just like i felt like i


---------05:55----------
was more happy


---------05:56----------
but i think some of that comes to do


---------05:58----------
with like the whole spontaneous nature


---------06:01----------
of that job right every party was


---------06:02----------
different and i noticed that with


---------06:04----------
streaming every day even though you


---------06:06----------
might be doing different things on


---------06:07----------
stream


---------06:07----------
the routine is mostly the same okay


---------06:11----------
and i feel like that's hard for me


---------06:13----------
because i do have add you know


---------06:14----------
and so it feels like that's like almost


---------06:17----------
like emotionally


---------06:18----------
like life sucking you know but at the


---------06:21----------
same time


---------06:22----------
i also have like a huge goal that i want


---------06:24----------
to achieve and i know that social media


---------06:27----------
is like the best way to get there


---------06:28----------
like monetarily you know and it's also


---------06:31----------
like


---------06:32----------
i feel really lucky to have social media


---------06:34----------
because so many people


---------06:35----------
want to have a platform and they don't


---------06:38----------
forget it


---------06:39----------
so part of me feels like um i need to be


---------06:42----------
able to take advantage of the


---------06:43----------
opportunity while i have it because you


---------06:44----------
know how long it's going to last you


---------06:45----------
know


---------06:46----------
yeah so i'm hearing like you kind of


---------06:49----------
being stuck or pulled in a lot of


---------06:51----------
different directions


---------06:53----------
on the one hand you have goals on the


---------06:55----------
other hand


---------06:56----------
you're grateful and lucky to have the


---------06:58----------
opportunities that you have


---------07:01----------
and on at the same time i'm sort of


---------07:03----------
noticing that like


---------07:04----------
taking advantage of those opportunities


---------07:07----------
and being grateful for what you've been


---------07:09----------
given


---------07:10----------
also comes at like a significant


---------07:12----------
personal cost


---------07:14----------
yeah that's really tough i mean how do


---------07:17----------
you


---------07:20----------
yeah i i mean it sounds it


---------07:23----------
because i'm i'm sort of hearing you give


---------07:26----------
a piece of yourself like every single


---------07:29----------
day


---------07:30----------
when you do something that's a little


---------07:31----------
bit more grindy and maybe you don't feel


---------07:33----------
like it but you recognize like this is


---------07:35----------
an amazing opportunity so


---------07:37----------
you sort of like want to do it and you


---------07:40----------
do want to do it but it just it seems


---------07:42----------
it sounds like it's hard to do yeah


---------07:45----------
what makes it hard


---------07:48----------
i guess like for me um i don't take


---------07:52----------
breaks


---------07:52----------
that's probably what makes it hard


---------07:54----------
because i think for the past four years


---------07:56----------
it's been like


---------07:57----------
stream stream stream stream stream like


---------08:00----------
like


---------08:00----------
not just like two hours a day but like


---------08:02----------
anywhere from i guess


---------08:03----------
eight to 15 hours days of streams yeah


---------08:07----------
and i don't take vacations or days off


---------08:08----------
because i'm like oh no the momentum


---------08:10----------
i would lose all the moments when


---------08:12----------
working towards because like in


---------08:13----------
streaming what i've noticed is like


---------08:15----------
to build something like sub number for


---------08:17----------
example it's the easiest to measure just


---------08:18----------
by the numbers


---------08:19----------
it can take months to build a few


---------08:21----------
thousand extra subs


---------08:22----------
but then if you disappear for a week you


---------08:24----------
can lose them like that


---------08:26----------
you know so it's like a very like high


---------08:27----------
cost type of job for if you take time


---------08:30----------
off


---------08:33----------
yeah that's hard so it sounds like you


---------08:35----------
have to


---------08:36----------
every day off is like


---------08:39----------
taking away something you built right


---------08:45----------
do you feel trapped kate a little bit


---------08:50----------
because i didn't like i guess for me


---------08:51----------
it's like i started streaming about four


---------08:53----------
years ago


---------08:54----------
so this has been most of my like young


---------08:56----------
adult life


---------08:58----------
right and it's like if you don't do


---------08:59----------
stream it's like you can't


---------09:01----------
there's really no other job that i can


---------09:03----------
think about that would have like


---------09:05----------
the same freedom of getting to do what i


---------09:08----------
want and also the same level of


---------09:10----------
financial support that it brings


---------09:12----------
towards like just living plus what i


---------09:15----------
want to achieve later


---------09:17----------
and and can you do you mind sharing what


---------09:19----------
you want you mentioned that once or


---------09:20----------
twice what do you want to achieve later


---------09:22----------
i want to open a animal rescue ranch


---------09:24----------
eventually like no kill


---------09:25----------
no snow cage so it would be like dog


---------09:28----------
sanctuary plus some like more farm


---------09:29----------
animals too maybe


---------09:31----------
and that's gonna be like a huge thing


---------09:32----------
that i went like about a big scale


---------09:34----------
so it's really difficult for me to like


---------09:37----------
justify time off because i feel like


---------09:39----------
it's taking away from that


---------09:40----------
opportunity you know


---------09:47----------
so it's like a difficult balance it's


---------09:48----------
like long term i know that


---------09:51----------
doing it like i have is mentally


---------09:52----------
draining so i'm probably not performing


---------09:54----------
at my top level


---------09:55----------
so like even though i'm streaming every


---------09:56----------
day i'm probably not growing as much as


---------09:58----------
i


---------09:58----------
could be if i was actually like um


---------10:01----------
mentally healthy because you know


---------10:02----------
there's a vibe that people have and


---------10:03----------
they're like they got it all together


---------10:05----------
just more charismatic to be around but


---------10:08----------
then if


---------10:08----------
i focus on my short term happiness and


---------10:10----------
like get myself put together then i have


---------10:12----------
less momentum and more distractions to


---------10:14----------
keep me from actually doing the job


---------10:20----------
it sounds like there are a lot of things


---------10:21----------
more important than you


---------10:26----------
probably let's play a part of it


---------10:30----------
i mean that's what i'm hearing right i'm


---------10:32----------
hearing that


---------10:34----------
like there are a lot of things like it's


---------10:35----------
like kate


---------10:37----------
versus growing your stream kate


---------10:40----------
versus the animal rescue wrench


---------10:45----------
kate versus amaranth


---------10:49----------
and and usually like kate ends up at the


---------10:52----------
bottom which i think is how you end up


---------10:54----------
four years without a break right because


---------10:57----------
i'm kind of noticing that


---------10:59----------
you know whenever you would take a break


---------11:00----------
there's just some voice in your head


---------11:02----------
that says but like


---------11:03----------
actually this is more important so you


---------11:06----------
can't do that


---------11:08----------
yeah what does that do to you


---------11:14----------
see i don't know that's the scary part


---------11:16----------
like i feel like i'm past


---------11:18----------
like people always say like don't keep


---------11:19----------
going you're gonna burn out but i feel


---------11:20----------
like i would have burned out by now so i


---------11:22----------
might be past that point and i just


---------11:23----------
don't even know anymore


---------11:26----------
how do you i'm like


---------11:30----------
how do you feel on a day-to-day basis


---------11:34----------
i don't really know i don't think about


---------11:36----------
it you know


---------11:38----------
it's like i just do it


---------11:43----------
sometimes we don't think about things


---------11:44----------
because


---------11:47----------
we don't like what we would discover


---------11:54----------
that's the thing i don't really know


---------11:55----------
what i would discover


---------11:58----------
how do you feel about yourself


---------12:07----------
that's the scary part is i don't know


---------12:08----------
anymore


---------12:13----------
what's scary about that


---------12:17----------
i feel like a robot a little bit


---------12:22----------
i mean that's how you treat yourself


---------12:24----------
right


---------12:26----------
every day wake up grind and for a good


---------12:30----------
reason


---------12:31----------
i think one of the hard hardest things


---------12:33----------
kate is that some of the worst things


---------12:34----------
that we do to ourselves


---------12:36----------
are not out of like selfish reasons but


---------12:39----------
actually selfless reasons


---------12:42----------
when we sacrifice we do it for bigger


---------12:45----------
causes right


---------12:46----------
causes with a capital c


---------12:49----------
yeah and it's hard because if you don't


---------12:52----------
make that sacrifice then


---------12:56----------
you know you're one step away from


---------12:58----------
[Music]


---------12:59----------
the rescue ranch and you're one step


---------13:02----------
away from all of those animals that need


---------13:05----------
love and protection and support and it


---------13:08----------
can almost feel like


---------13:09----------
your sacrifice like it's like there's


---------13:11----------
either you sacrifice yourself or you


---------13:12----------
sacrifice them


---------13:14----------
right is that how it feels


---------13:18----------
yeah i would say so like just the the


---------13:21----------
long term and don't don't feel bad yet


---------13:22----------
if i'm crying i'm like i'm okay i can


---------13:24----------
still talk it's just


---------13:25----------
my body that's how i just don't respond


---------13:27----------
to any kind of stress whether it's anger


---------13:29----------
sadness anxiety overwhelm happiness i


---------13:31----------
just cry it's just that's just me


---------13:33----------
um yeah that's pretty much how it feels


---------13:36----------
i guess it's like do i


---------13:37----------
cater to myself which feels shitty


---------13:40----------
because to me it's like the animals have


---------13:42----------
such a shorter life


---------13:44----------
and you know there's the whole concept


---------13:45----------
of like if an animal gets stuck in a


---------13:46----------
shelter


---------13:47----------
it sometimes can live just a few days


---------13:49----------
and then they kill it because there's


---------13:50----------
not enough space


---------13:52----------
so it feels really bad to like try and


---------13:55----------
value my life over theirs you know


---------14:00----------
so how does it feel if you value


---------14:02----------
yourself over them


---------14:07----------
selfish i guess


---------14:11----------
and how long have you been trying to not


---------14:13----------
be a selfish person


---------14:17----------
i guess most of my life i've just always


---------14:19----------
had like a very big


---------14:21----------
respect for animals and wanting to help


---------14:23----------
them since i was a kid


---------14:25----------
i think part of that comes from like not


---------14:27----------
really having many like social


---------14:29----------
guides in my family you know because my


---------14:31----------
parents didn't really have friends


---------14:32----------
coming over i never had like a social


---------14:34----------
example i was never good at making human


---------14:36----------
friends


---------14:36----------
i was always just friends with the dogs


---------14:38----------
on my street


---------14:41----------
can you tell me a little bit more about


---------14:42----------
that


---------14:45----------
um yeah i guess like i would just go


---------14:47----------
outside sometimes and like every day


---------14:49----------
like


---------14:49----------
my neighbors dogs just come up and roll


---------14:51----------
over for belly rubs and it was just like


---------14:53----------
a genuine connection where it felt like


---------14:56----------
you could actually connect to them


---------14:57----------
without


---------14:58----------
needing to be good at talking you know


---------15:01----------
and then from like a family where it's


---------15:03----------
my parents are always working


---------15:05----------
and i was like left at home most of the


---------15:07----------
time you get really lonely right


---------15:10----------
and so animals became like the only


---------15:12----------
thing i cared about


---------15:18----------
just how it is you said animals became


---------15:21----------
the only thing that you cared about but


---------15:22----------
i wonder if it's


---------15:25----------
animals really made you feel cared for


---------15:29----------
yeah that too there's like a mutual yeah


---------15:33----------
what was it like so it sounds like you


---------15:34----------
grew up without siblings


---------15:37----------
uh it's a little complicated i guess


---------15:39----------
because i had an


---------15:40----------
older brother who's kind of who's my


---------15:42----------
half brother that i really connected


---------15:43----------
with


---------15:45----------
but then when i was four he moved in


---------15:46----------
with his dad since i was from my mom's


---------15:48----------
second marriage


---------15:49----------
so he left the house and then i was


---------15:51----------
stuck with my other brother who had like


---------15:53----------
the middle child complex if you've seen


---------15:54----------
that before where it's like they don't


---------15:56----------
get the attention of the young one but


---------15:57----------
they also don't get


---------15:58----------
treated with respect like the older ones


---------16:00----------
so they just kind of like


---------16:01----------
act out out of spite so he was kind of


---------16:05----------
rude to me until he became an adult like


---------16:07----------
you know like big brother like pigs on


---------16:09----------
like no you can't play with me yeah like


---------16:12----------
sibling


---------16:13----------
violence i guess not like actual damage


---------16:15----------
just like without hitting each other


---------16:16----------
yeah so just sibling rivalry baby yeah


---------16:20----------
that's better yeah and and what was


---------16:24----------
i mean can you tell me a little bit more


---------16:25----------
about um


---------16:27----------
you know what kind of situation you grew


---------16:29----------
up in or what your house was like


---------16:30----------
growing up


---------16:32----------
um i guess it was just pretty boring


---------16:36----------
life you know because it says that my


---------16:38----------
parents were working but we didn't have


---------16:39----------
enough money to actually do anything


---------16:41----------
so we had enough money to survive but we


---------16:43----------
never traveled we never


---------16:44----------
like spent much time together so it was


---------16:47----------
just kind of like


---------16:48----------
there was nothing wrong with the family


---------16:50----------
you know like there was never


---------16:52----------
like domestic violence or never never


---------16:54----------
abused like my parents argued a lot but


---------16:55----------
i feel like most couples with


---------16:57----------
financial problems do that anyways so


---------16:59----------
nothing out of the ordinary


---------17:02----------
it was just like a lot of alone time i


---------17:04----------
guess because they were always working


---------17:08----------
it sounds like you understand why there


---------17:10----------
was a lot of alone time


---------17:14----------
yeah and you kind of you recognize that


---------17:18----------
that was sort of a necessity because


---------17:19----------
they had to work


---------17:21----------
yeah do you remember how you felt


---------17:25----------
um bored a lot


---------17:30----------
so like uh i didn't actually get my own


---------17:32----------
dogs i guess so i was like 12 because my


---------17:34----------
parents


---------17:34----------
didn't want me to have that


---------17:36----------
responsibility as a child because they


---------17:38----------
weren't there enough to be able to


---------17:39----------
help so i just like


---------17:42----------
started playing video games a lot and


---------17:44----------
like did art and stuff


---------17:46----------
so i found though that like with my 80d


---------17:49----------
like stuff like art there's only


---------17:50----------
i can focus on that like there are a few


---------17:52----------
things i can hyper focus on like


---------17:54----------
like training dogs art horseback riding


---------17:57----------
and i think like


---------17:58----------
um graphic design if i made like


---------18:01----------
web web images so i used to like do like


---------18:04----------
role play on


---------18:05----------
neopets because it was a dork and very


---------18:07----------
lonely so


---------18:08----------
so like certain things i could hyper


---------18:10----------
focus on but another thing is i was just


---------18:12----------
like really bored


---------18:13----------
super easily okay and and what was high


---------18:16----------
school like for you


---------18:20----------
more of the same to be honest i was kind


---------18:22----------
of like i guess a social outcast because


---------18:24----------
i didn't have any social


---------18:25----------
guides in my life so i never kind of


---------18:26----------
learned how to talk to people and how to


---------18:28----------
like


---------18:29----------
be emotionally savvy with other humans


---------18:31----------
it was more of just like


---------18:33----------
the loner waiting people to talk to me


---------18:35----------
and that never works when


---------18:36----------
everyone's waiting for people to talk to


---------18:38----------
them i found that as an adult


---------18:40----------
yeah it's like no no that's not


---------18:42----------
proactive enough to actually make


---------18:43----------
friends


---------18:44----------
and and so it sounds like like you've


---------18:45----------
learned a lot it sounds like you weren't


---------18:47----------
really modeled


---------18:48----------
uh there wasn't good modeling in terms


---------18:50----------
of how to you know engage with people


---------18:53----------
but at the same time just the fact that


---------18:55----------
you're talking about it like that


---------18:56----------
suggests to me that you've like figured


---------18:58----------
that out and you've


---------18:59----------
grown in some way yeah i think we talked


---------19:02----------
about on my own podcast a lot when i


---------19:04----------
have other girl influencers come on is


---------19:06----------
that we're all


---------19:06----------
so afraid of reaching out to each other


---------19:08----------
because we don't want to be seen as like


---------19:09----------
a leech


---------19:10----------
that like ends up just all of us are


---------19:12----------
lonely and don't talk to people


---------19:15----------
and how did you learn to overcome that


---------19:19----------
um i guess just by being online it's


---------19:22----------
easier right because it's like you send


---------19:24----------
them a message and you're like hey


---------19:25----------
come be on my podcast it's so much


---------19:27----------
different than walking up to somebody


---------19:29----------
and being like do you want to be friends


---------19:30----------
dude it's like a lot less scary


---------19:34----------
and and or do you feel like socially


---------19:37----------
more adept


---------19:38----------
now interpersonally or not so much


---------19:42----------
i feel like i can manage better um


---------19:45----------
at conventions especially like i feel


---------19:47----------
like i can talk to people


---------19:49----------
easier now but


---------19:52----------
there is always like that fear i guess


---------19:55----------
from social media that's like you don't


---------19:57----------
know what their intentions are


---------19:58----------
if they're meeting you at the convention


---------19:59----------
like i always have to have security and


---------20:01----------
stuff it's just like it has a problem i


---------20:02----------
have a problem trusting people now


---------20:03----------
because i have so many like stalker


---------20:05----------
types


---------20:06----------
that do follow me so it's like i can i


---------20:08----------
can manage better socially but there's


---------20:10----------
still part of me that like can't


---------20:11----------
truly connect in a genuine way sure


---------20:15----------
what what do you mean by their stalker


---------20:18----------
types uh


---------20:20----------
i does have various stalkers but you


---------20:22----------
don't really know who they are in person


---------20:23----------
right so like all you know is your


---------20:25----------
persona so you don't really know what


---------20:26----------
they look like often so you can't really


---------20:28----------
like trust them


---------20:28----------
at conventions when you meet people


---------20:30----------
because you don't know who


---------20:32----------
in real life was actually being really


---------20:34----------
creepy to you online


---------20:36----------
um so i i'm noticing a change in


---------20:40----------
in the tone of our conversation it seems


---------20:42----------
like a little bit easier


---------20:43----------
does it feel that way yeah


---------20:46----------
it's just i'm trying to breathe more


---------20:49----------
good for you breathing is important


---------20:51----------
um yeah i had a couple of thoughts about


---------20:55----------
understanding the relationship between


---------20:57----------
your body and your mind


---------21:00----------
and uh you know we can go down that road


---------21:02----------
in a second but


---------21:03----------
just to kind of give you a quick heads


---------21:05----------
up so you know i ask you


---------21:07----------
sometimes kate some questions about how


---------21:09----------
you feel about yourself


---------21:10----------
and you're saying i don't really know


---------21:13----------
and that in and of itself sounds kind of


---------21:15----------
scary right


---------21:16----------
is that fair to say yeah and then at the


---------21:19----------
same time i'm noticing that you also say


---------21:21----------
that this is just how my body reacts


---------21:24----------
like and so yeah


---------21:27----------
perfect so that's a great observation so


---------21:29----------
the question is like how does that work


---------21:31----------
and in my experience oftentimes people


---------21:34----------
who don't know what's going on


---------21:35----------
in their mind feel it in their body


---------21:40----------
and so if there is some kind of like so


---------21:42----------
i i mean i


---------21:43----------
really see this oftentimes more with men


---------21:45----------
but like


---------21:47----------
they don't know the vocabulary


---------21:51----------
or they feel colorblind to their


---------21:53----------
feelings


---------21:54----------
but they can like sense it in their body


---------21:57----------
in terms of like tension or you know


---------22:01----------
they get like a lot of tightness around


---------22:02----------
the shoulders they can clench their


---------22:04----------
fists


---------22:04----------
things like that so we can talk a little


---------22:06----------
bit down the road if you'd like to about


---------22:09----------
maybe how your body is sending you


---------22:10----------
signals about how you feel about things


---------22:13----------
even if you're not consciously aware of


---------22:14----------
them


---------22:16----------
right okay also you know i mean i i


---------22:19----------
don't want to go down the road of


---------22:20----------
actually


---------22:21----------
having a medical conversation but one


---------22:23----------
other thing that i've noticed


---------22:24----------
is that you know there's good data that


---------22:26----------
suggests that breathing issues and


---------22:28----------
anxiety are actually like very


---------22:30----------
tightly connected um so for example


---------22:33----------
diseases like asthma are worsened


---------22:36----------
depending on your mental state


---------22:38----------
and there's actually like physiological


---------22:39----------
reasons for that


---------22:41----------
so depending on you know hormones like


---------22:43----------
cortisol and like other things they can


---------22:45----------
actually make your breathing worse


---------22:47----------
um so high stress states for prolonged


---------22:49----------
periods of time will negatively impact


---------22:51----------
your respiratory system


---------22:54----------
so there may be something kind of there


---------22:56----------
but so those are just like


---------22:58----------
that's you know one or two thoughts i


---------23:00----------
wanted to hear a little bit about


---------23:01----------
kind of what your upbringing was because


---------23:03----------
sometimes when people are feeling a


---------23:05----------
certain way in terms of


---------23:07----------
what i'm basically hearing from you is


---------23:09----------
that you're not really sure who you


---------23:11----------
are anymore you're kind of like losing


---------23:15----------
yourself


---------23:17----------
in the grind yeah


---------23:20----------
and it seems like a lot of the reason


---------23:23----------
that you grind that way is because of


---------23:26----------
these like


---------23:26----------
big goals like goals with a capital g


---------23:30----------
and so i was and and part of the reason


---------23:32----------
that


---------23:33----------
you have those big i mean i think part


---------23:34----------
of the reason that you sacrifice


---------23:35----------
yourself is because you do


---------23:37----------
place other things above you


---------23:43----------
and so the reason i was asking about


---------23:44----------
your upbringing is because sometimes


---------23:46----------
people are sort of taught that


---------23:48----------
so they're taught that they may be not


---------23:51----------
as important as other things or they're


---------23:55----------
taught oddly enough like


---------23:56----------
selfless sacrifice to the point of


---------23:59----------
hurting yourself


---------24:00----------
can be taught two ways one is if you


---------24:02----------
were very very neglected


---------24:05----------
the second is if actually someone did


---------24:07----------
that for you


---------24:09----------
and then you're kind of like that was


---------24:10----------
the behavior that was modeled


---------24:13----------
right um does any of that sort of like


---------24:16----------
ring a bell or resonate


---------24:17----------
or gain traction with you i know i sort


---------24:19----------
of kind of talked about a lot of


---------24:20----------
different stuff i understand what you're


---------24:21----------
saying but i don't think that any of


---------24:22----------
that was actually in my childhood


---------24:24----------
because for the most part you know my


---------24:25----------
parents worked like they still told me


---------24:27----------
they loved me


---------24:27----------
you know it's like they've gotten


---------24:29----------
frustrated with each other but like as


---------24:30----------
an adult you understand


---------24:32----------
why as a kid you're just like oh shut up


---------24:34----------
it's like y'all are so annoying


---------24:36----------
type of thing because like you know you


---------24:37----------
can hear them doing in like your room or


---------24:40----------
outside


---------24:40----------
just about like stupid stuff like you


---------24:42----------
didn't get cabbage this is lettuce


---------24:44----------
it's like really really stupid


---------24:48----------
things yeah i don't think that my


---------24:50----------
childhood really affected me in that way


---------24:51----------
as far as my upbringing maybe just the


---------24:53----------
isolation


---------24:54----------
set me on the path for like social


---------24:57----------
issues


---------24:59----------
like nothing that really like it's not


---------25:01----------
so much anything that they did


---------25:02----------
specifically i guess more of what they


---------25:04----------
didn't do as far as like show examples


---------25:07----------
and like this is how people socialize


---------25:08----------
with each other


---------25:11----------
yeah it sounds like they were pretty


---------25:12----------
busy so they may not have had time to do


---------25:14----------
that


---------25:14----------
yeah so thanks for sharing that i i


---------25:16----------
think um i'm kind of with you there kate


---------25:18----------
it doesn't seem like this is something


---------25:20----------
that started in your childhood not


---------25:21----------
everything does


---------25:23----------
and so then let me ask you something you


---------25:25----------
know when did you


---------25:27----------
learn how did you learn to like put


---------25:30----------
yourself


---------25:30----------
last


---------25:34----------
when did you start doing that


---------25:38----------
i'm not sure when i feel like part of it


---------25:42----------
was probably um when i was streaming


---------25:45----------
i think in 2017 and then while i was


---------25:48----------
streaming


---------25:49----------
one of my dogs started having like bloat


---------25:51----------
which is um i didn't find that


---------25:53----------
out to later what it was but that's when


---------25:55----------
like the dog's stomach if he eats too


---------25:57----------
fast


---------25:58----------
or drinks too fast and then goes to do


---------26:00----------
an activity sometimes the stomach can


---------26:02----------
start filling with


---------26:02----------
air and then it turns on itself and it


---------26:05----------
starts expanding and it cuts off all of


---------26:07----------
their like organs and they just like die


---------26:08----------
within 30 minutes and that's what


---------26:10----------
happened i didn't know what's happening


---------26:11----------
at the time it was super traumatic


---------26:13----------
yeah but i feel like after that is when


---------26:15----------
i said myself last probably


---------26:21----------
at some level i know that i couldn't


---------26:22----------
stop it but i still feel responsible for


---------26:24----------
him dying because i was streaming at the


---------26:26----------
time


---------26:28----------
i know like there was nothing i could do


---------26:30----------
right it's one of those things that


---------26:32----------
happens it could literally happen if


---------26:33----------
like someone else was feeding your dogs


---------26:34----------
you weren't home


---------26:35----------
or if you just put your food outside and


---------26:37----------
go put do something else like


---------26:38----------
it could happen at any time it was just


---------26:40----------
some really bad coincidence that


---------26:42----------
happened while i was streaming so


---------26:44----------
yeah i can hear that your mind


---------26:46----------
understands that but how do you feel


---------26:48----------
about it


---------26:50----------
shitty okay


---------26:54----------
i can understand that you would feel


---------26:56----------
that way what does that mean


---------27:00----------
just like if i had been


---------27:03----------
there with him while he was eating maybe


---------27:05----------
he wouldn't have ran and got his


---------27:07----------
bloat started you know but i know that


---------27:09----------
like especially since i didn't even know


---------27:11----------
what it was at the time


---------27:12----------
i would have no idea right it wasn't


---------27:14----------
something that i was aware of and was


---------27:15----------
just like neglecting the situation it's


---------27:17----------
something that's not even talked about


---------27:18----------
by vets very much


---------27:19----------
they just say oh dogs of this breed can


---------27:22----------
be prone to bloat but they never


---------27:23----------
actually explain what that


---------27:24----------
is or the symptoms or anything oh my god


---------27:28----------
yeah so it's like it's like common in


---------27:30----------
german shepherds and stuff


---------27:33----------
oh was it was your dog a german shepherd


---------27:35----------
or a german shepherd


---------27:37----------
i grew up with a few german shepherds


---------27:41----------
um so it's uh so


---------27:44----------
kate i'm hearing you kind of like you


---------27:46----------
i'm seeing emotionally i'm seeing one


---------27:48----------
thing


---------27:49----------
and the words that are coming out of


---------27:51----------
your mouth seem to be something else


---------27:54----------
so like you're saying it wasn't my fault


---------27:56----------
it's a coincidence


---------27:57----------
it could have happened at any time and


---------27:58----------
it sounds like you really understand


---------28:00----------
that and yet


---------28:01----------
you still feel pretty shitty about it


---------28:04----------
i'm guessing that you feel guilty


---------28:08----------
like there's a disconnect it's like i


---------28:10----------
know i shouldn't but they still do


---------28:12----------
yeah so why shouldn't you feel guilty


---------28:17----------
because there's nothing i could do at


---------28:19----------
the time for him right


---------28:20----------
because it's like it happened at


---------28:21----------
midnight and the only way to for them to


---------28:24----------
even have a chance of living if it


---------28:25----------
starts doing that is to get them to like


---------28:26----------
an emergency


---------28:28----------
clinic and there were like none around


---------28:29----------
me at midnight and the operation then


---------28:32----------
may not even work to save sure so it was


---------28:34----------
like something that like really


---------28:35----------
was just an unfortunate thing that i


---------28:37----------
couldn't do anything about


---------28:38----------
so i know that it's not my fault like


---------28:40----------
that he had this


---------28:42----------
but i also just it feels bad right


---------28:45----------
because it's like you wish you would


---------28:46----------
spend more time with them


---------28:49----------
yeah and and so i want you to pay


---------28:51----------
attention to what you said there i know


---------28:53----------
it's not my fault


---------28:54----------
but it feels bad and what i hear you


---------28:58----------
doing right now is reassuring yourself


---------29:01----------
does that make sense like you're almost


---------29:04----------
like a friend consoling yourself


---------29:06----------
you're you're trying to tell the longest


---------29:07----------
time i did feel like it was my fault but


---------29:09----------
like i've come to terms like no there's


---------29:11----------
like it could


---------29:12----------
literally happen at any time you could


---------29:13----------
be out of town and someone would come


---------29:15----------
feed them and it could still happen


---------29:17----------
yeah or you could be with them and you


---------29:19----------
wouldn't i mean you can't


---------29:21----------
know what's happening to their stomach


---------29:24----------
right


---------29:24----------
you know so it sounds like you feel


---------29:27----------
pretty


---------29:27----------
beat up about that and and you know i


---------29:31----------
asked you when did you start putting


---------29:32----------
yourself last and then you came up with


---------29:34----------
this story


---------29:35----------
so how has this affected you


---------29:38----------
i think it made me feel like um


---------29:41----------
afterwards it's like yeah i gave him


---------29:43----------
like he i guess i got him when he was


---------29:45----------
like six months old so i've had until he


---------29:46----------
was five and this happened and i was


---------29:48----------
like he got to live five like really


---------29:49----------
good years imagine all those dogs in the


---------29:51----------
shelter because i


---------29:52----------
didn't get him from a shelter who gets


---------29:53----------
to live there for like a week and


---------29:55----------
because no one claims them they just


---------29:56----------
kill them


---------29:57----------
you know and so i guess like feeling


---------30:00----------
guilty for that even though like i know


---------30:02----------
i shouldn't kind of like make me


---------30:04----------
find my life purpose so in a way like


---------30:06----------
it's something i'm really passionate


---------30:07----------
about so i know that


---------30:09----------
good has come from the incident as


---------30:11----------
horrible as it sounds


---------30:13----------
but it just feels really bad though


---------30:14----------
because he didn't get to live longer


---------30:16----------
you know it really is a real tragedy


---------30:25----------
and so i i had to see him die right i


---------30:28----------
like saw him having


---------30:29----------
seizures it was like a really traumatic


---------30:31----------
like nightmare type of


---------30:32----------
traumatizing event for a long time


---------30:36----------
and now like i still have nightmares


---------30:38----------
occasionally of like


---------30:39----------
a zombie version of him coming out of


---------30:41----------
the ground and running around which is


---------30:43----------
really [ __ ] up but it's like it


---------30:45----------
affects me still


---------30:46----------
after three years but i also know that


---------30:49----------
it's something that i can't do anything


---------30:51----------
about


---------30:53----------
so what do we do when something affects


---------30:55----------
us and we can't do anything about it


---------30:58----------
we cry yeah


---------31:01----------
right so kate i'm getting the sense that


---------31:04----------
you you're still


---------31:05----------
carrying this burden and even though you


---------31:08----------
know it's not


---------31:09----------
really logical at the same time


---------31:13----------
so if we think about behavior behavior


---------31:16----------
is not just


---------31:18----------
motivated by logic


---------31:21----------
right and and i'm kind of i'm getting


---------31:23----------
the sense that there's like that emotion


---------31:26----------
is part of what keeps you from taking


---------31:28----------
care of yourself and taking a break and


---------31:31----------
things like that because it's sort of


---------31:32----------
like


---------31:34----------
like does that make sense


---------31:37----------
and what do you think about that


---------31:44----------
i don't really know it's more of just


---------31:46----------
like one of the things like i really


---------31:47----------
want this skull


---------31:48----------
and so i just keep going and then that's


---------31:50----------
why i'm confused i'm like do i


---------31:53----------
chase the long-term dreams that i know


---------31:55----------
would make me like


---------31:56----------
fulfilled in my life ultimately like


---------31:58----------
what i really want to do my passion


---------32:00----------
or do i like take care of myself in the


---------32:02----------
moment and like


---------32:03----------
indulge in little like moments of joy to


---------32:05----------
keep myself mentally staying


---------32:07----------
at the risk of like my momentum of the


---------32:10----------
career because it is a very momentum


---------32:11----------
based


---------32:13----------
thing that i found with social media so


---------32:15----------
it's like if you take a little time off


---------32:16----------
then


---------32:17----------
you're like monetization directly is


---------32:19----------
impacted


---------32:20----------
you know yeah


---------32:29----------
can i think for a second yeah go for it


---------32:43----------
it may be a long second


---------32:47----------
it's okay my second's thinking about


---------32:49----------
having very long too


---------33:04----------
why are you less deserving than other


---------33:06----------
people or animals


---------33:08----------
hmm i don't know if it's so much i


---------33:11----------
consider myself less deserving it's just


---------33:13----------
that it's hard for me to


---------33:16----------
want other things like as much


---------33:19----------
what do you mean by other things like


---------33:23----------
taking free time off feels less


---------33:25----------
rewarding to me


---------33:26----------
than having my animal ranch fulfilled


---------33:31----------
because it's like the things i could do


---------33:33----------
in the meantime like


---------33:34----------
take a day off go for it i don't know


---------33:37----------
whatever mental


---------33:38----------
health things people do to relax what


---------33:40----------
are they gonna go to the spa


---------33:41----------
they travel i don't even know i've never


---------33:42----------
done any of it


---------33:45----------
it's like i don't know i just like free


---------33:47----------
time


---------33:48----------
having free time quote unquote doesn't


---------33:50----------
feel as rewarding to me


---------33:54----------
okay sorry i'm getting it


---------33:57----------
alone though right all i have is like me


---------33:59----------
and my dogs which is great but dogs


---------34:01----------
can't go everywhere


---------34:02----------
right and so i don't really have like a


---------34:03----------
bunch of friends local that i could like


---------34:05----------
even think of


---------34:06----------
activities to do with


---------34:10----------
okay so like time alone feels less


---------34:13----------
rewarding i guess


---------34:17----------
i'm wondering if actually like not only


---------34:19----------
were social skills not modeled but


---------34:21----------
relaxation and recreation weren't


---------34:23----------
modeled


---------34:24----------
what do you think probably i mean i


---------34:27----------
don't think my parents


---------34:28----------
ever did that either like we never took


---------34:30----------
vacations or anything because mostly


---------34:32----------
because we didn't have the money to


---------34:33----------
yeah but that's you know


---------34:36----------
that's probably created my lack of


---------34:39----------
desire for a vacation because i've never


---------34:41----------
seen how like fun it is


---------34:43----------
you know i've never been exposed to the


---------34:45----------
thrills of relaxing


---------34:48----------
okay i'm gonna need a minute because


---------34:50----------
this is


---------34:51----------
things are coming together for me but


---------34:53----------
i'm also there a lot of different


---------34:55----------
directions can i just think


---------34:57----------
that's fine okay so let's just think


---------34:59----------
about this


---------35:18----------
trying to sketch out a plan


---------35:23----------
to transform your life oh


---------35:27----------
but really to transform your way


---------36:14----------
okay sorry for the silence i know it


---------36:17----------
doesn't make for a very


---------36:18----------
entertaining


---------36:21----------
twitch chat i just glanced over i made


---------36:23----------
the mistake of glancing at twitch and


---------36:24----------
they said get cats


---------36:32----------
i already have dogs i'm good


---------36:36----------
what kind of dogs do you have i have a


---------36:39----------
border collie and a caucasian shepherd


---------36:42----------
what's a caucasian shepherd uh they


---------36:44----------
aren't very popular here they're like um


---------36:46----------
russian mountain dogs used for like


---------36:49----------
guardian protection


---------36:50----------
they guard russian prisons big


---------36:55----------
and ballpark i learned this i made this


---------36:58----------
mistake on the first or second time i


---------36:59----------
ever did a stream where i asked


---------37:01----------
a young woman where she's from and i


---------37:03----------
realized i'm not supposed to do that but


---------37:05----------
i'm just curious


---------37:05----------
generally what part of the country do


---------37:07----------
you live in


---------37:09----------
i'm in texas i'm in texas too


---------37:13----------
oh i grew up in texas


---------37:16----------
same i think i lived in the same house


---------37:20----------
until i moved out


---------37:23----------
okay


---------37:29----------
so i think some of this stuff is like


---------37:31----------
spiritual


---------37:33----------
some of it is like a little bit more


---------37:35----------
psychological and some of it is a little


---------37:37----------
bit more physiological


---------37:39----------
and i realize we haven't been talking


---------37:41----------
very long so


---------37:42----------
generally speaking i try to tie things


---------37:44----------
together for people at the end


---------37:46----------
but i think you've you've done such an


---------37:48----------
awesome job of like sharing so much


---------37:50----------
like so much rich information that i'd


---------37:53----------
like to lay out a couple things and then


---------37:55----------
i'm curious about


---------37:56----------
how we can help you or maybe explore


---------38:00----------
whatever sticks because some of it may


---------38:02----------
not stick any of it may not stick


---------38:04----------
does that sound okay yeah


---------38:07----------
so the first thing is like i get the


---------38:09----------
sense kate that it's you


---------38:11----------
or them right like you make a lot of


---------38:14----------
decisions


---------38:15----------
every day where it's like i have to do


---------38:16----------
this or like i get to choose one or the


---------38:19----------
other


---------38:20----------
and the crazy thing is that like that


---------38:22----------
fundamentally needs to change


---------38:25----------
it needs to be you and them and i think


---------38:27----------
you already actually suspect this in


---------38:29----------
some ways where you kind of say


---------38:31----------
if i don't take care of myself i can't


---------38:33----------
quite pop


---------38:34----------
on stream sometimes the way that i


---------38:36----------
showed or i need to


---------38:38----------
and that like the quality of your


---------38:39----------
streams could actually go up


---------38:41----------
taking care of yourself and as someone


---------38:44----------
who works like in stress


---------38:46----------
management is my day job that is what i


---------38:48----------
see overwhelmingly


---------38:50----------
people tend to have this idea


---------38:53----------
that you know i don't have time for


---------38:55----------
wellness so i'll leave you with a really


---------38:57----------
fascinating i think quote from the dalai


---------38:59----------
lama


---------39:00----------
in the dalai lama said people should


---------39:02----------
meditate for half an hour a day


---------39:05----------
if they don't have the time they should


---------39:07----------
meditate for


---------39:10----------
how long what do you think uh


---------39:14----------
10 minutes beautiful no he said if you


---------39:17----------
don't have the time you should meditate


---------39:19----------
for an hour


---------39:22----------
right do we need it more yeah


---------39:25----------
and i know it sounds absolutely crazy


---------39:27----------
but like that's actually how it works


---------39:30----------
people who don't have time to meditate


---------39:32----------
for half an hour when they meditate for


---------39:34----------
an


---------39:34----------
hour everything gets better and they


---------39:37----------
find the time


---------39:38----------
so when i teach like so i do some work


---------39:40----------
with like corporations and stuff and


---------39:41----------
like part of what i tell them is that


---------39:43----------
you can't tell people to take care of


---------39:45----------
themselves off of the clock


---------39:47----------
so what i actually encourage like


---------39:49----------
companies and hospitals to do


---------39:51----------
is like bake meditating time into their


---------39:54----------
day


---------39:55----------
and pay him for it you'll see a return


---------39:57----------
on your investment


---------39:58----------
it's crazy but what i tell people is


---------40:01----------
when they call me in for like a


---------40:02----------
meditation training i say don't have me


---------40:04----------
come at 5 pm


---------40:05----------
have me come in the middle of the


---------40:06----------
workday and they don't have to stay


---------40:07----------
longer


---------40:08----------
it's dedicated time to take care of


---------40:10----------
yourself because that's actually part of


---------40:12----------
your job


---------40:13----------
it's part of your job and so the first


---------40:16----------
thing that has to change is that you've


---------40:17----------
got to start stop thinking in terms of


---------40:19----------
either or


---------40:20----------
and and then the question becomes okay


---------40:24----------
how the [ __ ] do we do that


---------40:25----------
so that's one thing right so like


---------40:28----------
yeah so we'll get to that so but i just


---------40:32----------
want you to notice


---------40:33----------
that your mind is programmed to think in


---------40:36----------
terms of either ors


---------40:38----------
it's like i have to do this or that and


---------40:40----------
i just don't


---------40:41----------
accept that logical premise


---------40:46----------
so you're going to wake up and like you


---------40:48----------
know you're going to say like okay i


---------40:49----------
could do this but i don't feel like


---------40:51----------
doing this i don't i really don't want


---------40:52----------
to do this


---------40:54----------
and then your mind is going to


---------40:55----------
automatically go to like either i do


---------40:57----------
this or i do this but like just


---------40:59----------
try to take a step back and try to find


---------41:01----------
an and somewhere in there


---------41:03----------
can you start stream a little bit later


---------41:05----------
every day can you stream for like less


---------41:06----------
than 15 hours


---------41:08----------
you know can you like like put some


---------41:10----------
kinds of limits around it


---------41:11----------
take care of yourself and stream


---------41:14----------
second thing is i think you've gotta


---------41:17----------
unburden yourself


---------41:18----------
and i know there's a lot of these


---------41:19----------
questions are going to be like how and


---------41:21----------
so we'll get to that


---------41:22----------
but i mean i get the sense kate that you


---------41:24----------
carry around


---------41:26----------
a lot of weight which really does not


---------41:28----------
need to be on your shoulders


---------41:31----------
and what i mean by that is like you have


---------41:33----------
this pressure to create this range like


---------41:35----------
i don't know


---------41:36----------
how to explain this to you but like you


---------41:38----------
can't really do that


---------41:40----------
right so like for the same reason that


---------41:42----------
like there's the random bloat stuff and


---------41:44----------
i don't mean to bring up something


---------41:45----------
negative but my point is that


---------41:46----------
there's a certain amount of rng in real


---------41:48----------
life


---------41:50----------
and for you to slave and sacrifice


---------41:52----------
yourself


---------41:53----------
for like this thing is i just don't


---------41:56----------
think that that's


---------41:57----------
fair or even reasonable can the ranch


---------42:00----------
happen absolutely should you devote


---------42:01----------
yourself to it absolutely


---------42:04----------
and at the same time there's a certain


---------42:05----------
amount of [ __ ] rng


---------42:07----------
right so like i it sounds crazy to me


---------42:09----------
that like you're you're


---------42:11----------
doing all of this stuff but like take a


---------42:12----------
step back and recognize that


---------42:14----------
you know the ranch is going to happen if


---------42:16----------
it's going to happen


---------42:18----------
the other thing is that like what you


---------42:20----------
kind of mentioned this nightmare about a


---------42:22----------
zombie dog


---------42:23----------
what i'm actually envisioning is 10


---------42:24----------
years from now you succeed at the ranch


---------42:27----------
and instead of like disney princess kate


---------42:30----------
running it


---------42:31----------
and it's gonna be like have you seen


---------42:33----------
snow white like the old one


---------42:35----------
yeah so like you know how snow white


---------42:37----------
runs around a lot of animals like


---------42:38----------
surrounding her that are singing and


---------42:40----------
dancing and stuff like that


---------42:42----------
that's what i envision the ranch is what


---------42:44----------
the ranch should be


---------42:46----------
and what i'm actually seeing is like


---------42:48----------
zombie kate running


---------42:50----------
the ranch because that's what you're


---------42:52----------
gonna turn into


---------42:54----------
the way that you're going and it's gonna


---------42:56----------
be like everything is like scary and


---------42:58----------
like you're like a zombie because you


---------43:00----------
burnt out and


---------43:00----------
and you're like i don't even know what


---------43:02----------
burning out is that means you burnt out


---------43:04----------
you're already burnt out


---------43:06----------
this is this is burnout yeah that's what


---------43:08----------
i was like wondering because everyone's


---------43:09----------
like


---------43:10----------
always sworns about a burnout i'm like i


---------43:11----------
never felt that coming does that mean


---------43:12----------
that it's by past that point


---------43:14----------
yeah so let me give you a quick heads up


---------43:16----------
if you don't know who you are as a


---------43:18----------
person you cry at random times


---------43:20----------
and you feel like your soul is being


---------43:22----------
sucked away by social media


---------43:24----------
you might be burnt out probably


---------43:28----------
those may be signs of burnout i don't


---------43:30----------
know what that sign of but burnout sure


---------43:32----------
as hell


---------43:32----------
like kind of fits there right yeah so i


---------43:36----------
i really do think it's worthwhile to


---------43:37----------
kind of


---------43:38----------
take a step back and think about you


---------43:40----------
know in order for you to really


---------43:41----------
make the ranch what you want it to be


---------43:45----------
what it needs is not like burden


---------43:48----------
like it's not like a sense of like


---------43:50----------
severe duty that's going to create the


---------43:52----------
place that i


---------43:53----------
envision when i hear you talk about it


---------43:55----------
it's actually like


---------43:56----------
love and caring and what i'm hearing


---------43:59----------
from you is that like


---------44:00----------
that person is slipping away from you


---------44:03----------
which is why it's so [ __ ] terrifying


---------44:05----------
you're just not that person anymore it


---------44:07----------
doesn't feel like you are that person is


---------44:08----------
still in there


---------44:09----------
we gotta let her out we'll get to the


---------44:11----------
house but i genuinely do think that


---------44:13----------
taking care of yourself


---------44:15----------
is gonna help you be the person that has


---------44:17----------
that compassion to get


---------44:20----------
if you look at studies of burnout the


---------44:23----------
first thing to go


---------44:24----------
when someone gets burnt out is empathy


---------44:26----------
and compassion


---------44:29----------
that's what your mind and body and


---------44:31----------
physiology and neuroscience sacrifice


---------44:34----------
so if you look at physicians who are


---------44:35----------
burnt out the number one sign of burnout


---------44:38----------
is a lack of empathy


---------44:40----------
people stop caring about their patients


---------44:41----------
they go there and they like do the work


---------44:43----------
of saving their lives


---------44:44----------
but they stop caring when you you know


---------44:47----------
when you're working with a patient who's


---------44:49----------
been diagnosed with


---------44:50----------
cancer and the family like wants to talk


---------44:51----------
to you about things that are not medical


---------44:54----------
the compassionate physician sits down


---------44:57----------
and has that conversation the burnt out


---------45:00----------
physician which doesn't mean that


---------45:01----------
they're an [ __ ]


---------45:02----------
is like looking at their clock and


---------45:04----------
thinking about okay where when can i get


---------45:06----------
out of this room


---------45:07----------
and like finish up my orders and check


---------45:09----------
in with the nurses and do all my


---------45:11----------
documentation so that i can go home


---------45:13----------
at a reasonable hour like 8 30 at night


---------45:15----------
and i've been here since 7 in the


---------45:16----------
morning


---------45:18----------
and it's not the physician's fault it's


---------45:19----------
just compassion goes first


---------45:21----------
so i genuinely think that like you've


---------45:22----------
got to start taking care of yourself so


---------45:24----------
that you can be the compassionate person


---------45:26----------
like


---------45:26----------
that's why i think you're losing


---------45:28----------
yourself because you can't


---------45:30----------
you can't be that person right i think


---------45:33----------
in my case because i don't have other


---------45:34----------
people around me it's like that


---------45:36----------
has been towards myself compassion and


---------45:37----------
empathy what do you mean


---------45:39----------
towards yourself like losing it losing


---------45:41----------
it towards myself like my self-care and


---------45:43----------
stuff


---------45:44----------
yeah absolutely other people it's a very


---------45:46----------
isolated job


---------45:48----------
and and that we kind of see too because


---------45:50----------
i i think like you know because i i get


---------45:52----------
the sense that i mean


---------45:53----------
clearly you've told us that you actually


---------45:55----------
like don't take care of yourself


---------45:58----------
right and and that for example you have


---------45:59----------
some potential medical problems that


---------46:01----------
may need to be reevaluated and stuff but


---------46:03----------
you can't find the time in the day


---------46:05----------
right um so the last thing is that like


---------46:09----------
i encourage you to i know this may sound


---------46:11----------
bizarre and and maybe we can have a


---------46:12----------
brief conversation about like religion


---------46:14----------
or spirituality but like


---------46:16----------
i encourage you to think about taking


---------46:17----------
what life has given you


---------46:19----------
so like you're lucky and you're grateful


---------46:21----------
which is awesome


---------46:22----------
but also like you know just because


---------46:25----------
you're lucky and great


---------46:26----------
grateful and you have this opportunity


---------46:28----------
doesn't mean that you have to sacrifice


---------46:30----------
yourself


---------46:32----------
i mean something about this just feels


---------46:34----------
to me like you're not


---------46:35----------
counting on the forces whether they be


---------46:39----------
twitch at


---------46:40----------
your general charisma your rng or your


---------46:43----------
cosmic duty


---------46:45----------
are like they're supporting you and then


---------46:48----------
you don't have to do it all yourself


---------46:50----------
like i came onto this platform and i


---------46:51----------
tried to do it all by myself and like it


---------46:53----------
doesn't work i can't do it


---------46:55----------
i can't save the internet it's


---------46:57----------
ridiculous


---------46:58----------
but that's how we feel right like you


---------47:00----------
feel like you have to do it all yourself


---------47:01----------
but like


---------47:02----------
don't i mean i don't know how else to


---------47:04----------
say i mean as someone who has


---------47:05----------
recognized that i am very very well


---------47:08----------
supported by like thousands of people


---------47:10----------
like there are people who are in your


---------47:12----------
corner too


---------47:14----------
you don't have to grind out every sub to


---------47:17----------
make this ranch happen


---------47:19----------
like if the ranch really is going to


---------47:20----------
happen it can't be done just by you


---------47:23----------
because you're talking about making it


---------47:25----------
big


---------47:25----------
right yeah and so are you thinking about


---------47:28----------
personally bankrolling it


---------47:31----------
um part of it's going to be like


---------47:33----------
fundraising i feel like through social


---------47:35----------
media but


---------47:36----------
i guess for me personally i want to make


---------47:38----------
sure that i'm


---------47:40----------
like i have enough money saved up for


---------47:42----------
like emergencies or just general life


---------47:44----------
things for myself


---------47:45----------
so that that way every um discretionary


---------47:48----------
income that i make can be


---------47:49----------
spent towards the charity organization


---------47:52----------
aspect of it so yeah it's not my income


---------47:55----------
anymore but instead it's like


---------47:56----------
through the charity yeah so i i think


---------47:59----------
that like so just


---------48:00----------
like stop and think about that so that


---------48:02----------
when you when you wake up on a


---------48:04----------
particular day and you're like hey i


---------48:05----------
need to start streaming right away or i


---------48:07----------
need to keep streaming like


---------48:08----------
i don't know how those thoughts if those


---------48:11----------
thoughts like factor in


---------48:13----------
to your decision in the moment do they


---------48:19----------
i guess at this point it's not really


---------48:20----------
thinking about it it's more of just like


---------48:22----------
ingrained in me it's like i get up and i


---------48:25----------
do this


---------48:25----------
and like i like i wouldn't know what


---------48:27----------
else to do with my day at this point


---------48:29----------
where it's like as far as working


---------48:31----------
productively towards


---------48:32----------
the goal goes yeah so then i think we


---------48:35----------
get to the next thing


---------48:36----------
so i like your idea of a charity and


---------48:38----------
stuff like this because


---------48:39----------
as someone who also had a mission to


---------48:41----------
create an organization and


---------48:43----------
personally bankroll it it's not


---------48:45----------
sustainable


---------48:46----------
you're just going to tear yourself apart


---------48:48----------
i was working a full-time job


---------48:50----------
as a doctor and trying to start a


---------48:52----------
healthy gamer and it just doesn't work


---------48:55----------
um so the last thing


---------48:59----------
i think is is kind of like more


---------49:00----------
practical which is like okay so like


---------49:01----------
what do we do about this stuff


---------49:03----------
right and i think some of this stuff is


---------49:05----------
actually like super super like nuts and


---------49:06----------
bolts


---------49:07----------
it sounds to me like you literally don't


---------49:08----------
know how to take care of yourself


---------49:12----------
yeah a little bit and i i don't mean


---------49:15----------
that to be like


---------49:16----------
does that sound condescending no okay i


---------49:19----------
just have


---------49:19----------
like if i've never been taught in my


---------49:22----------
home life i also never like


---------49:23----------
tried to do it as an adult then


---------49:25----------
naturally you just like don't know what


---------49:26----------
to do


---------49:27----------
yeah absolutely so you know here


---------49:30----------
so so then we can talk about practically


---------49:32----------
like how do you take care of yourself


---------49:34----------
and and some of this stuff also involves


---------49:36----------
like behavioral reinforcement because


---------49:38----------
on the one hand i'm feeling like this


---------49:40----------
sense of like you know duty


---------49:42----------
or to create this thing for animals and


---------49:45----------
like make the world a better place


---------49:47----------
and on the other hand like even when you


---------49:49----------
don't like that


---------49:50----------
at least the grind feels rewarding


---------49:53----------
because you know you're moving towards


---------49:55----------
this like


---------49:55----------
ultimate goal yeah and then


---------49:59----------
the flip side is like if you don't


---------50:00----------
stream for a day then you're just kind


---------50:01----------
of twiddling your thumbs and like


---------50:03----------
doing laundry and like kind of hanging


---------50:05----------
out around the house and you're like i


---------50:06----------
don't even know what the [ __ ] i'm doing


---------50:07----------
with my life


---------50:09----------
yeah and so how can we help you


---------50:13----------
get some kind of reinforcement through


---------50:16----------
taking care of yourself that you can


---------50:17----------
start to like learn and appreciate like


---------50:19----------
that's also an important practical thing


---------50:22----------
um so


---------50:26----------
thoughts about what i've said so far


---------50:30----------
um yeah i mostly agree i think another


---------50:32----------
part is just like


---------50:34----------
i know that there are certain things


---------50:35----------
that help me clear my mind but it's also


---------50:37----------
like justifying them i guess


---------50:39----------
getting to a point where it's like oh


---------50:41----------
that would be great but then afterwards


---------50:42----------
it's like look at all the time you


---------50:44----------
wasted that you could have been


---------50:45----------
streaming with


---------50:46----------
so if i like took time off to like maybe


---------50:48----------
go like horseback riding or something


---------50:50----------
which is like


---------50:51----------
a meditative activity for me you know


---------50:53----------
you can clear your mind think be out in


---------50:55----------
nature it's great but then it's like


---------50:56----------
afterwards you're like


---------50:57----------
and i just spent the whole morning not


---------51:00----------
streaming


---------51:00----------
kind of like flip side guilt yeah so


---------51:04----------
how long have you been feeling that


---------51:06----------
guilt


---------51:09----------
probably for maybe like three years or


---------51:12----------
so


---------51:12----------
so is this also like it sort of started


---------51:14----------
when your dog passed away


---------51:16----------
yeah okay


---------51:20----------
so kate


---------51:24----------
okay so there's so much to talk about so


---------51:26----------
first of all i want to just kind of


---------51:27----------
check in with you about how this


---------51:28----------
conversation is going


---------51:30----------
i'm noticing that a lot of times i have


---------51:32----------
like emotional conversations with people


---------51:34----------
where there's a lot of like catharsis


---------51:37----------
and like realizing what's really holding


---------51:39----------
you back kind of stuff


---------51:41----------
um are you hoping for something like


---------51:43----------
that is that what you want


---------51:46----------
i guess that would be nice also just


---------51:48----------
like


---------51:50----------
it's they feel like it's also just an


---------51:51----------
important conversation to have about


---------51:53----------
like


---------51:53----------
it's okay to feel this kind of way for


---------51:55----------
screamers you know where it's like the


---------51:56----------
grind makes you like


---------51:57----------
like you're going crazy i think that's


---------51:59----------
like normal to know that you're not


---------52:00----------
crazy


---------52:01----------
yeah a lot


---------52:05----------
that is important um so can you tell me


---------52:08----------
about


---------52:09----------
you know what what about streaming makes


---------52:12----------
you feel like you're going crazy


---------52:14----------
um i guess like i i personally


---------52:18----------
do have 80d so it's like just like the


---------52:19----------
chat in general doesn't


---------52:21----------
work well with my ability to retain


---------52:24----------
information or to process it at all


---------52:26----------
you know okay like i think your


---------52:27----------
conversation with misgive


---------52:29----------
and he he also has the same issues that


---------52:31----------
i felt like


---------52:32----------
there's like problems like focusing on


---------52:35----------
like conversations typically if i like


---------52:38----------
if i'm looking at chat like right now i


---------52:39----------
have chat clothes because i get


---------52:40----------
i get so distracted um i have difficulty


---------52:44----------
like taking in just like my environment


---------52:47----------
things happening around me i'll often be


---------52:48----------
like in my own head and i'll like


---------52:50----------
sometimes just like bump into stuff at


---------52:52----------
stores i just don't realize like


---------52:53----------
anything's there


---------52:54----------
and then like i'm super messy i also do


---------52:56----------
the thing of like leaving fridge doors


---------52:58----------
open


---------52:59----------
jars off lids when i was living with my


---------53:01----------
roommate


---------53:02----------
they would often think that i got


---------53:04----------
abducted


---------53:05----------
because they would come home and like


---------53:08----------
groceries outside of the car because i


---------53:10----------
would be like making trips unloading the


---------53:12----------
car and i would just like get distracted


---------53:14----------
and do something else and then the


---------53:15----------
cabinet would be open the jar of peanut


---------53:18----------
butter


---------53:18----------
would be left like with the lid off and


---------53:21----------
like the milk cap


---------53:22----------
wasn't screwed on but it was still put


---------53:24----------
back in the fridge


---------53:26----------
so it was like stuff like that where


---------53:28----------
they're like what happened here


---------53:29----------
okay yeah it does seem like you got


---------53:31----------
abducted everything's like half done


---------53:34----------
right so it's sort of like


---------53:35----------
someone just walked in and just snatched


---------53:36----------
you up yeah


---------53:39----------
and and so that sounds like add really


---------53:41----------
does


---------53:42----------
yeah um yeah i mean that doesn't make


---------53:45----------
you crazy but you


---------53:46----------
said something about social media and


---------53:48----------
and streaming and how


---------53:50----------
you kind of feel crazy sometimes i


---------53:52----------
juggle too many things


---------53:53----------
right or like i try to which would be


---------53:56----------
like i guess


---------53:57----------
okay if i was healthy but because i


---------53:59----------
don't get enough sleep because of the


---------54:01----------
pressures of social media having to


---------54:02----------
constantly make stuff get stuff done on


---------54:04----------
all the platforms


---------54:05----------
i feel like my mind can't handle it off


---------54:07----------
on a functional level


---------54:09----------
like because i i have three youtube


---------54:11----------
channels i have two


---------54:12----------
in no three instagrams i have two


---------54:14----------
twitters and i stream full-time


---------54:16----------
as well and and i also have to have


---------54:19----------
photo shoots during the week for


---------54:20----------
instagram


---------54:21----------
and like it's why it's


---------54:24----------
why do you have three instagrams because


---------54:27----------
i have my personal one in case something


---------54:29----------
ever happens to my main one


---------54:31----------
um and then i also have my dog's


---------54:33----------
instagram because i'm trying to grow


---------54:35----------
that towards like the animal stuff later


---------54:37----------
in life and network with trainers and


---------54:39----------
things on that


---------54:40----------
uh so yeah i have i'm very diverse and i


---------54:43----------
feel like


---------54:45----------
my 80d mentality thinks like i can


---------54:47----------
handle this i'm used to multitasking


---------54:49----------
yeah but because i'm


---------54:50----------
taking care of myself i just feel like


---------54:52----------
i'm actually going insane


---------54:54----------
more than i normally would be with all


---------54:55----------
the multitasking


---------54:57----------
what is going insane what do you mean by


---------54:58----------
that like


---------55:00----------
bringing fog a lot like i'll just like


---------55:02----------
stop like i'll


---------55:03----------
i can't remember what i was doing and


---------55:04----------
stuff you know it's like different from


---------55:06----------
like process information like mid task


---------55:08----------
i'll just be like totally blanking on


---------55:11----------
like what i was just doing


---------55:14----------
okay so you're noticing like a cognitive


---------55:16----------
impact


---------55:17----------
is yeah you say the word insane to


---------55:20----------
describe it is like having a browser and


---------55:23----------
you keep opening new tabs to the point


---------55:25----------
where it just no longer responds


---------55:28----------
okay so i'm not hearing anything kind of


---------55:31----------
emotional in terms of insanity what i'm


---------55:33----------
hearing is like more


---------55:34----------
cog like cognition so it's like like


---------55:37----------
you're kind of


---------55:38----------
you know your program crashes like


---------55:40----------
making pv and j


---------55:42----------
dot exe has crashed and it's just yeah


---------55:45----------
just stop and then there's like peanut


---------55:47----------
butter and jelly jars


---------55:48----------
in two different places yeah it's a lot


---------55:50----------
of like different effects i guess


---------55:52----------
because the emotional side feels like


---------55:54----------
because i don't like cater to like my


---------55:55----------
own self i don't i don't have like


---------55:57----------
as much personality or know myself


---------55:59----------
anymore you know but then there's also


---------56:00----------
the cognitive side where i feel like i'm


---------56:02----------
doing so much that like


---------56:03----------
my mind is actually stopping its


---------56:05----------
performance


---------56:06----------
okay who did you used to be


---------56:09----------
i guess just more like spontaneous and


---------56:13----------
energetic and fun like i still have like


---------56:15----------
a lot of energy but not like


---------56:18----------
in my um emotional side it's weird it's


---------56:22----------
like i have physical energy


---------56:24----------
but i'm not like as bubbly or happy


---------56:27----------
on a daily basis if that makes sense


---------56:29----------
it's weird it's like hard to explain


---------56:31----------
because i guess english doesn't have


---------56:32----------
that many good words for it but it's


---------56:34----------
like


---------56:34----------
emotional energy is a lot less


---------56:38----------
what keeps you what what kind of keeps


---------56:41----------
you from being happy on a day-to-day


---------56:42----------
basis


---------56:45----------
i just overloaded my system like like i


---------56:48----------
don't have enough free time to do


---------56:49----------
the things that i know would be helpful


---------56:51----------
for myself like to de-stress


---------56:54----------
what like the like the like taking long


---------56:58----------
walks


---------56:58----------
i guess with the dogs or like horseback


---------57:00----------
riding things i'm just like there's not


---------57:02----------
enough hours in the day to accomplish


---------57:04----------
all the different aspects of my social


---------57:05----------
media empire


---------57:07----------
and also still take time for myself so


---------57:10----------
it's like


---------57:11----------
i know kind of like what would help but


---------57:14----------
then


---------57:14----------
it would also be detrimental i feel to


---------57:16----------
the career side so it's like a lot of


---------57:18----------
conflicting


---------57:24----------
feelings


---------57:29----------
i also do not have a good sleep schedule


---------57:31----------
which is like i know that it's bad


---------57:34----------
but i also feel like every time i try to


---------57:37----------
like


---------57:37----------
finish my tasks faster and go to sleep


---------57:40----------
there's just always more to do


---------57:42----------
how many hours yeah so you know


---------57:47----------
you know the problem with sleep


---------57:48----------
schedules is that they're wonderful in


---------57:50----------
theory


---------57:52----------
but like practically like who the [ __ ]


---------57:54----------
has time for a sleep schedule


---------57:57----------
does that make sense yeah so


---------58:01----------
my average is like four to five hours


---------58:04----------
how many


---------58:04----------
hours a day do you work


---------58:07----------
um i guess technically every time i'm


---------58:11----------
not


---------58:11----------
sleeping i'm working in some way because


---------58:13----------
it's either like getting ready for


---------58:15----------
stream you know like makeup and hair and


---------58:17----------
all that or like i'm


---------58:19----------
uh doing photo shoots


---------58:22----------
for my other platforms or i'm like


---------58:24----------
answering messages and emails so i guess


---------58:26----------
i work constantly if i'm not sleeping


---------58:29----------
which i guess in my case should be


---------58:31----------
considered napping because it's really


---------58:32----------
not that restful


---------58:36----------
this is [ __ ] awful dude yeah


---------58:44----------
what how do you feel when i say that


---------58:49----------
true


---------58:50----------
like a big true


---------58:55----------
what's what's true about it


---------58:59----------
it's not healthy


---------59:02----------
i mean that's true what else


---------59:07----------
what's awful about it


---------59:12----------
i don't know what else well it's hard to


---------59:13----------
put in the words i guess like just the


---------59:15----------
feeling of being trapped again


---------59:27----------
trying to figure out how to dig further


---------59:30----------
right and and you do yeah that's


---------59:32----------
something i haven't really been able to


---------59:34----------
do


---------59:34----------
lately what are you trapped by


---------59:42----------
i guess the what i know it might be like


---------59:44----------
just my psychological


---------59:46----------
feeling of what the job requires but


---------59:48----------
just like having to be


---------59:49----------
constantly uploading content everywhere


---------59:51----------
just to keep everything alive and


---------59:53----------
working together towards like


---------59:55----------
constant growth rather than loss i guess


---------59:58----------
of


---------59:59----------
numbers and relevancy and monetary and


---------60:02----------
all that stuff


---------60:03----------
and it's not so much like an ego thing


---------60:05----------
like i don't really care about if it was


---------60:06----------
just


---------60:06----------
like you know myself like i feel like i


---------60:09----------
have enough confidence as a person


---------60:12----------
it's just like the the dream that i have


---------60:14----------
it's like so intense that i feel like no


---------60:15----------
i don't want it to slip away because


---------60:16----------
it's like a very rare opportunity that


---------60:18----------
most people don't get


---------60:19----------
i feel to actually like be in the


---------60:22----------
position where you can


---------60:23----------
actually accomplish what you want


---------60:28----------
so you feel lucky and it's almost i'm


---------60:30----------
almost getting the sense that you feel


---------60:32----------
beholden to the dream


---------60:34----------
and the big dream because you can


---------60:37----------
actually achieve it


---------60:40----------
yeah it almost yeah it's like most


---------60:42----------
people just have dreams and they never


---------60:43----------
get to even have a chance at achieving


---------60:45----------
them


---------60:46----------
and so you would be an ungrateful little


---------60:49----------
[ __ ] if you had the chance to achieve


---------60:51----------
your dream and you let it slip by


---------60:52----------
because you wanted to sleep for five and


---------60:55----------
a half hours instead of five


---------60:57----------
right so kate i'm gonna say something to


---------61:01----------
you it may sound kind of weird


---------61:05----------
i think what you've done is you've


---------61:07----------
managed to build an empire


---------61:11----------
and empires i know this is going to


---------61:15----------
sound like kind of a silly question it's


---------61:16----------
not a trick question


---------61:18----------
so you know what requires more of your


---------61:21----------
life force


---------61:23----------
one youtube channel or three


---------61:34----------
i'm actually not sure because i feel


---------61:36----------
like for me


---------61:38----------
once i'm in the mode of working you know


---------61:41----------
like it doesn't feel much different


---------61:44----------
maybe i'm just so used to it


---------61:45----------
it's where like working a little bit i


---------61:47----------
might as well work a lot because if


---------61:49----------
it feels like the same amount of energy


---------61:50----------
for each task you know


---------61:53----------
yeah so that that sort of boggles my


---------61:56----------
mind because the short answer is three


---------61:58----------
youtube channels take more energy than


---------62:00----------
one youtube channel


---------62:02----------
and sometimes we you know i kind of talk


---------62:04----------
about


---------62:05----------
thoughts and i think what you've managed


---------62:07----------
to do kate is you built this


---------62:09----------
empire and the bigger it grows the more


---------62:12----------
of you it


---------62:13----------
takes right


---------62:17----------
and like as you get closer and closer to


---------62:19----------
success


---------62:20----------
you get more and more like lost


---------62:25----------
because like now there's three


---------62:26----------
instagrams and three youtubes and then


---------62:28----------
like not only do each of them require


---------62:30----------
their own thing and two twitters


---------62:32----------
plus streaming plus photo shoots


---------62:35----------
and you could give it was fine to


---------62:38----------
sacrifice yourself when there wasn't


---------62:40----------
like that much


---------62:42----------
the empire wasn't as big and hungry as


---------62:44----------
it is now


---------62:46----------
but you fed it and it's grown


---------62:50----------
and then it wants more and the only


---------62:53----------
place that you know


---------62:54----------
like where to feed it is from yourself


---------62:58----------
and what i'm almost getting the sense of


---------63:00----------
is that like you're getting consumed by


---------63:02----------
it


---------63:04----------
yeah i mean the first in the first five


---------63:08----------
minutes you were talking about like


---------63:09----------
losing yourself in social media


---------63:13----------
and now what i'm kind of getting a


---------63:15----------
picture of is like you've like created


---------63:16----------
this monster


---------63:18----------
and then the more you feed it the bigger


---------63:20----------
it grows


---------63:21----------
and the bigger it grows the hungrier it


---------63:23----------
gets and the more food it needs


---------63:28----------
right and then you're just getting keep


---------63:31----------
everything growing


---------63:32----------
yeah what do you think about that


---------63:39----------
it just is what it is if you want to go


---------63:41----------
that route right it's like


---------63:43----------
i don't really know how to keep it


---------63:44----------
growing without like


---------63:47----------
cutting without cutting back a


---------63:48----------
significant amount and still like


---------63:50----------
catering to my happiness right it's like


---------63:52----------
it's almost like i have to choose


---------63:54----------
and the problem is i don't want to


---------63:55----------
choose i'm very indecisive like i want


---------63:58----------
both and as a result of that i feel like


---------64:00----------
neither


---------64:01----------
yep so there it is right i feel like i


---------64:04----------
have to choose


---------64:05----------
no you don't have to there's there's


---------64:07----------
you're thinking that's the


---------64:08----------
you or them you feel like you have to


---------64:11----------
choose i don't think


---------64:12----------
you actually need to choose i know it


---------64:13----------
sounds crazy


---------64:15----------
but i i think you can take care of


---------64:16----------
yourself and


---------64:18----------
that the empire can i mean there may be


---------64:20----------
practical things in terms of


---------64:22----------
i don't know if you like work with other


---------64:23----------
people or like you have employees or you


---------64:26----------
like farmers helps with some stuff


---------64:30----------
yeah so i mean there's always that kind


---------64:31----------
of stuff but and ultimately if you want


---------64:33----------
to grow i think that's the right you


---------64:34----------
have to go because you can't do it all


---------64:36----------
yourself


---------64:38----------
but i think that this is this is the


---------64:40----------
crux of the problem and i think in your


---------64:42----------
case


---------64:43----------
i have something that i really want to


---------64:44----------
tell you but i think it's going to


---------64:46----------
terrify


---------64:49----------
lay it on me i've already terrified


---------64:51----------
myself a lot


---------64:52----------
i think you've got to let go of your job


---------64:57----------
and i'm not saying that you shouldn't


---------64:59----------
pursue it


---------65:01----------
right but like you can't there's no such


---------65:04----------
thing as like


---------65:05----------
long-term happiness that very idea


---------65:08----------
is false this is like part of the gold


---------65:11----------
at the end of the rainbow and i see this


---------65:15----------
time and time and time again like so


---------65:17----------
like my favorite examples are from


---------65:18----------
investment banking


---------65:20----------
so these are people who work really hard


---------65:22----------
in college to get their dream job


---------65:24----------
and then they get their dream job at a


---------65:26----------
place like goldman sachs


---------65:28----------
and then they're like an analyst there


---------65:30----------
which means that they're at the bottom


---------65:32----------
of the totem pole


---------65:32----------
and if they just keep grinding and keep


---------65:34----------
grinding things are going to get better


---------65:37----------
and then they find themselves as


---------65:40----------
associates and they have more money and


---------65:42----------
now they can fly first class


---------65:44----------
for the 10 days that they get to


---------65:46----------
themselves every year


---------65:49----------
right and then the other 355 they're


---------65:51----------
working and then they become


---------65:53----------
vice presidents then they become


---------65:54----------
directors and then they become managing


---------65:56----------
directors


---------65:58----------
and then they make 16 million dollars a


---------66:00----------
year and they've made it


---------66:03----------
and they sacrifice so much they're 58


---------66:05----------
years old


---------66:06----------
they've been divorced three times


---------66:10----------
and that's the end of the rainbow


---------66:14----------
and then they look back at their life


---------66:16----------
and they're like this


---------66:18----------
is it this is what i did it for


---------66:21----------
and they're filled with regret and


---------66:23----------
loneliness and it's not what it was


---------66:24----------
supposed to be it's not what they


---------66:26----------
thought it was


---------66:27----------
it was a fantasy and then ultimately


---------66:30----------
like each step of the way in theory


---------66:32----------
things got better and they moved closer


---------66:34----------
and closer to their goal


---------66:35----------
and like are you moving closer and


---------66:37----------
closer to your goal


---------66:39----------
uh i am and how does that feel


---------66:44----------
it's like a light at the end of the


---------66:45----------
tunnel right it's like oh i'm almost


---------66:47----------
there and then i can like


---------66:49----------
feel the peace and enjoy but then part


---------66:51----------
of me is like what if i get there


---------66:53----------
and i'm so [ __ ] up that i can't even


---------66:56----------
find that happiness i'm looking for yeah


---------67:00----------
and i think the scary thing kate is i'm


---------67:02----------
hearing that


---------67:03----------
the closer you get to your goal the


---------67:05----------
worse that you feel


---------67:08----------
and the worse that you feel the more you


---------67:10----------
hold on to the fantasy


---------67:11----------
because that'll make it okay


---------67:16----------
and then like that's 22 yep


---------67:20----------
and so i think kate you gotta start


---------67:22----------
living for today


---------67:25----------
and if if the light at the end like i


---------67:27----------
have faith in you i think that


---------67:30----------
your passion and compassion and drive


---------67:34----------
and dedication


---------67:36----------
are not gonna disappear if you take a


---------67:38----------
week off


---------67:40----------
like you're not gonna magically


---------67:41----------
transform into a [ __ ] lazy [ __ ]


---------67:45----------
you know like if you take a week off i


---------67:47----------
want you to have faith in yourself that


---------67:49----------
you'll get there one day and you're not


---------67:51----------
gonna do it on your own and killing


---------67:52----------
yourself in the process is


---------67:54----------
certainly not gonna help and as your


---------67:57----------
empire has grown and you've gotten


---------67:58----------
closer and closer to like success


---------68:02----------
you like fall more and more into the


---------68:03----------
dark side


---------68:06----------
right and then you like you reach all of


---------68:08----------
your ambitions and then you look back at


---------68:10----------
your life and it's like


---------68:11----------
empty and filled with like ruin and


---------68:14----------
that's not


---------68:15----------
good yeah and i know it's really really


---------68:19----------
scary but i think you've got to start


---------68:21----------
letting go like i'm not saying don't try


---------68:25----------
but what i'm saying is like don't attach


---------68:27----------
yourself to that


---------68:28----------
outcome it's kind of like you're looking


---------68:31----------
at the top of the mountain


---------68:33----------
and you're kind of saying it's going to


---------68:34----------
be amazing when i get to the top it's


---------68:35----------
going to be amazing when i get to the


---------68:36----------
top


---------68:37----------
which which you should really be focused


---------68:39----------
on is like how am i going to take the


---------68:40----------
next step


---------68:41----------
you can't ever avoid taking the next


---------68:44----------
step


---------68:44----------
and is that the right step or the wrong


---------68:46----------
step


---------68:49----------
and what i'm hearing right now is that


---------68:50----------
like you've pulled a muscle


---------68:53----------
and you're forcing yourself to continue


---------68:56----------
to climb


---------68:58----------
and like that's not the way to get to


---------69:00----------
the top of the mountain


---------69:03----------
as someone who's tried to climb them out


---------69:05----------
and pulled a muscle and kept going


---------69:08----------
crazy story then maybe i'll share it one


---------69:09----------
day but


---------69:11----------
does that make sense like i just don't


---------69:13----------
like i think you've got to take care of


---------69:14----------
yourself in the here and now


---------69:15----------
and like don't i mean i know it sounds


---------69:17----------
weird to say don't worry but


---------69:19----------
just have faith in yourself that you'll


---------69:21----------
get to where you want to go


---------69:24----------
yeah it makes sense it's just like i


---------69:26----------
guess it's hard to


---------69:29----------
let go of the grind because of the way


---------69:31----------
that if i was on youtube i feel like


---------69:33----------
it'd be easier because you can schedule


---------69:35----------
a bunch of videos and then take a week


---------69:36----------
off and it's fine


---------69:37----------
it's like you weren't didn't even


---------69:38----------
disappear just i think twitch is unique


---------69:40----------
in the fact that like


---------69:42----------
when you're not live people are


---------69:44----------
constantly being distracted


---------69:45----------
with other people who are alive and it's


---------69:47----------
like if you're gone for a week that's


---------69:48----------
how habits form and they just watch


---------69:50----------
other people and so it feels like you're


---------69:52----------
losing


---------69:52----------
everything that you've built and like


---------69:55----------
it's just difficult to like


---------69:57----------
justify time off because it's how it is


---------69:59----------
especially with like the way the


---------70:00----------
subsystem works like people are falling


---------70:02----------
off every day


---------70:03----------
i feel like it would be a little easier


---------70:05----------
but twitch would probably never fix this


---------70:06----------
if they had like


---------70:08----------
a certain day like the first of the


---------70:09----------
month where subs were charged then you


---------70:11----------
can like schedule your time off


---------70:13----------
but that's just not how it is so it's


---------70:15----------
really hard to like justify that


---------70:17----------
yeah so i i don't know that you should


---------70:19----------
take a week off but what i'm thinking


---------70:21----------
about is like it starts small


---------70:23----------
right so you've built up this empire by


---------70:26----------
feeding the beast


---------70:27----------
one bite at a time and then two bites


---------70:29----------
and then three bites and four bites


---------70:30----------
and i think your road to balance is the


---------70:33----------
same way


---------70:36----------
so i think it's not so much about don't


---------70:38----------
because like you say that the


---------70:39----------
pile of tasks you have to do is endless


---------70:41----------
right


---------70:42----------
there's always something else to do so


---------70:45----------
at the end of the day


---------70:46----------
you know you have a hundred tasks and


---------70:48----------
you can do 40 of them


---------70:50----------
on a given day like what's the


---------70:53----------
difference between 38 and 40.


---------70:55----------
so what i would encourage you to do is


---------70:57----------
set aside some amount of your day


---------70:59----------
to take care of yourself every day


---------71:02----------
don't think about it as doing less work


---------71:05----------
because you actually may not even do


---------71:06----------
less work it's just carve out the time


---------71:09----------
for like


---------71:09----------
one hour a day to like do something for


---------71:11----------
yourself


---------71:13----------
what do you think about that


---------71:17----------
yep it's definitely more i guess um


---------71:20----------
reasonable of an approach


---------71:22----------
to me


---------71:25----------
the discipline and actually following


---------71:27----------
through with that yeah


---------71:29----------
yeah so so dis discipline is like i


---------71:33----------
think discipline is not the right word


---------71:34----------
discipline is not what you need what you


---------71:36----------
need is practice right so this is


---------71:40----------
everyone's like oh i'm lazy it's going


---------71:41----------
to be hard


---------71:42----------
i guarantee you it's going to be hard


---------71:43----------
it's not you're not it's not discipline


---------71:46----------
discipline is not actually the answer at


---------71:48----------
all you don't need to be disciplined


---------71:49----------
you're never going to be disciplined


---------71:51----------
you're always going to be a creature


---------71:53----------
that is like pulled by your impulses


---------71:56----------
that's what people with add are and i


---------71:57----------
think that's actually okay


---------71:59----------
like 80d is a problem because you leave


---------72:01----------
peanut butter or jars open but it also


---------72:03----------
allows you to thrive


---------72:05----------
in a social media environment because


---------72:06----------
you can manage


---------72:08----------
eight social media accounts plus a


---------72:10----------
twitch stream


---------72:11----------
yeah people without add can't do that


---------72:13----------
[ __ ]


---------72:15----------
like your mind is actually designed to


---------72:17----------
thrive in this sort of environment


---------72:19----------
and you need to practice doing something


---------72:22----------
else


---------72:24----------
and so i don't know if it's like


---------72:25----------
horseback riding like do you do


---------72:27----------
scheduling or no do you do schedules


---------72:30----------
no not really or just like when


---------72:34----------
i feel like i can't handle anymore i'll


---------72:35----------
just like do something and then but then


---------72:37----------
i'll


---------72:37----------
during it it's like i'll feel great and


---------72:39----------
then afterwards it's like oh no


---------72:42----------
it's so much type of thing it's like


---------72:44----------
it's it clears my mind in the moment and


---------72:46----------
then after you feel like


---------72:48----------
the guilt yeah so let's talk about that


---------72:50----------
for a second


---------72:51----------
okay so just because you have


---------72:55----------
okay this is going to sound like a


---------72:57----------
stupid question so sorry if it confuses


---------72:59----------
you because it's so


---------73:00----------
stupid but our thoughts facts


---------73:05----------
no okay so like you're gonna go


---------73:08----------
horseback riding


---------73:09----------
and then you're gonna feel guilty right


---------73:13----------
and then that guilt is going to generate


---------73:16----------
thoughts


---------73:18----------
does that make sense yeah so you're


---------73:21----------
gonna say like oh i wasted so much time


---------73:23----------
but those are just they're just [ __ ]


---------73:24----------
thoughts they're like


---------73:25----------
patterns they're like conditioning it


---------73:28----------
doesn't actually mean


---------73:29----------
that's true like sure you spent an hour


---------73:33----------
horseback riding and you could have done


---------73:36----------
some things during that hour but even if


---------73:37----------
you had done things during that hour you


---------73:39----------
still would not ever be doing enough


---------73:43----------
right it's kind of like let's say that


---------73:44----------
i'm trying to empty the ocean with a


---------73:46----------
teaspoon


---------73:48----------
and then i spend an hour horseback


---------73:50----------
riding instead of emptying the ocean


---------73:52----------
and then i come back and it's like oh my


---------73:54----------
god i could have emptied 30 teaspoons


---------73:56----------
out of the ocean


---------73:57----------
and it's like yeah that's technically


---------73:58----------
true but who the [ __ ] actually cares


---------74:00----------
it's not gonna make a difference


---------74:03----------
yeah it's true and what i want you to do


---------74:06----------
so this is like very important for like


---------74:07----------
people who are watching too is that


---------74:09----------
do something to take care of yourself


---------74:11----------
but don't do it to take care of yourself


---------74:12----------
do it as an experiment so go horseback


---------74:16----------
riding today's friday


---------74:18----------
do you stream over the weekend yeah


---------74:22----------
can you go horseback riding over the


---------74:23----------
weekend


---------74:25----------
like i imagine it's safer in terms of


---------74:27----------
covet stuff right


---------74:28----------
because texas is crazy right now so your


---------74:32----------
your homework is to go horseback riding


---------74:35----------
and more importantly you're gonna go


---------74:37----------
horseback riding and then what you're


---------74:38----------
gonna do is pay attention


---------74:40----------
watch and see when the feelings of guilt


---------74:43----------
arise


---------74:46----------
and like just let them arise and they're


---------74:48----------
gonna have those thoughts and like


---------74:50----------
you kind of like you know it's sort of


---------74:51----------
like when you're training a dog like the


---------74:53----------
dog sometimes barks


---------74:56----------
and if you kind of like give into it


---------74:58----------
it's gonna like agitate more


---------75:01----------
but if you kind of just behave with


---------75:02----------
tranquility then you kind of like


---------75:04----------
it'll calm down and see what happens


---------75:07----------
with how long the guilty thoughts last


---------75:08----------
if you don't feed into them


---------75:10----------
you don't disagree with them kind of say


---------75:12----------
yeah you're right i could have


---------75:14----------
i could have done more but i chose not


---------75:16----------
to


---------75:18----------
i'm going to feel guilty so be it what


---------75:20----------
do you think about that


---------75:24----------
i think that it's it's probably likely


---------75:26----------
i'll soon forget with my way of thinking


---------75:29----------
of like


---------75:29----------
if i don't focus on it i'll move on to


---------75:31----------
something else in my mind


---------75:33----------
okay so this is also so good


---------75:37----------
i was getting the sense that something


---------75:38----------
about that wasn't sitting well with you


---------75:40----------
um and and so then the question becomes


---------75:42----------
so then like how but so so what are you


---------75:43----------
gonna do about that kate like this is


---------75:45----------
just because you forget about things


---------75:47----------
like you can't


---------75:49----------
in my mind you have to figure out some


---------75:51----------
way to and i can help you


---------75:53----------
but um you know just because your mind


---------75:57----------
is likely to forget


---------75:58----------
doesn't mean that you can't you can't


---------76:00----------
give up practicing because you're likely


---------76:02----------
to forget


---------76:04----------
it's sort of like you have to do with


---------76:06----------
this in spite of that does that make


---------76:08----------
sense or am i losing you yeah


---------76:10----------
yeah it makes sense so i mean that's


---------76:12----------
also where i'd say like you're streaming


---------76:13----------
right now


---------76:14----------
right and how long are you streaming


---------76:18----------
today


---------76:21----------
i don't really know typically it goes


---------76:23----------
until i'm like okay i have things to do


---------76:25----------
and i don't have like a set schedule for


---------76:27----------
my end time typically just for my start


---------76:30----------
times


---------76:30----------
okay can you go tomorrow horseback


---------76:34----------
riding


---------76:37----------
no not tomorrow why not


---------76:41----------
um because i already had stuff


---------76:44----------
planned for tomorrow's stream i wanted


---------76:46----------
to do like cooking and like a dog walk


---------76:49----------
and stuff


---------76:50----------
that's i plan out my streams weekly so


---------76:53----------
that's why it's like all so hard i have


---------76:54----------
to like kind of like schedule


---------76:56----------
i guess the time off hold on hold on i'm


---------76:59----------
confused


---------77:00----------
i thought you didn't do well with


---------77:02----------
schedules not for my own time


---------77:05----------
my free time okay so now we get to a


---------77:08----------
really important point


---------77:10----------
this has to be part of your job it's not


---------77:13----------
free time


---------77:15----------
yeah you remember when i was telling you


---------77:16----------
like when i go to a corporation i'm like


---------77:18----------
yeah


---------77:18----------
you guys are going to have me teach


---------77:19----------
meditation can't be at 5 p.m when


---------77:21----------
everyone's ready to go home


---------77:23----------
has to be during work hours you need to


---------77:26----------
reduce the amount that you work


---------77:28----------
not squeeze this in as extra kate this


---------77:31----------
must change this is part of your job


---------77:36----------
because zombie kate is not gonna get as


---------77:39----------
many subs


---------77:40----------
as fun kate living cape let's call her


---------77:44----------
living gate and zombie cake


---------77:46----------
yeah right so this has to be part of


---------77:49----------
your job


---------77:51----------
and where's the rebellion go ahead rebel


---------77:55----------
i'm i don't have any right now really


---------77:58----------
really


---------78:00----------
so when do you make your schedule for


---------78:01----------
the week


---------78:03----------
uh sunday night okay so do you have can


---------78:07----------
you do it can you go horseback riding on


---------78:08----------
sunday


---------78:10----------
no i have a podcast okay i have to


---------78:13----------
schedule it for some time next week


---------78:15----------
okay so schedule it as part of your day


---------78:19----------
and if you need to to feed the social


---------78:21----------
media beast take a lot of selfies


---------78:27----------
how does that feel it's it's not so much


---------78:30----------
like a


---------78:30----------
a selfie type thing it's more just like


---------78:34----------
the stream okay


---------78:37----------
even better than no selfies that sounds


---------78:40----------
far healthier to me


---------78:42----------
but you gotta schedule time for yourself


---------78:44----------
my dude


---------78:46----------
like it's the only way this is gonna


---------78:47----------
work because you're just getting lost


---------78:51----------
hate is getting consumed by amram


---------78:55----------
yeah and you've got to like help her out


---------78:58----------
like she needs your help


---------79:00----------
she's like it's almost if you want to


---------79:02----------
get super like freudian and


---------79:04----------
psychoanalytical


---------79:05----------
you were you were sacri you were leaving


---------79:08----------
kate


---------79:08----------
alone at home while amaranth goes to


---------79:10----------
work


---------79:11----------
for 16 18 20 hours a day


---------79:14----------
and you're doing exactly to yourself


---------79:16----------
what your parents did to you


---------79:19----------
which is not abusive it's just


---------79:22----------
you always come last because there are


---------79:24----------
more important necessities


---------79:29----------
yeah makes sense


---------79:34----------
emotions


---------79:38----------
uh i don't know it's hard for me to like


---------79:40----------
feel emotions lately like as far as like


---------79:42----------
expressing them like i feel them but i


---------79:43----------
don't know how to describe them


---------79:45----------
yeah what do you feel that you don't


---------79:48----------
worry about describe tell me what you


---------79:49----------
physically feel


---------79:54----------
[Music]


---------79:56----------
i feel like tension i guess still in my


---------79:58----------
body


---------79:59----------
i but i also don't sleep so i'm not


---------80:02----------
seeing that part of me is wondering like


---------80:03----------
how much of it is because i don't


---------80:05----------
physically take care of myself


---------80:07----------
versus like the actual job itself


---------80:10----------
both it's not either or there's your


---------80:13----------
either or thinking again


---------80:15----------
is it because i don't take care of my


---------80:16----------
physical self or because of the job


---------80:18----------
both right


---------80:23----------
and i can tell that you've got some


---------80:24----------
emotion i think maybe what i said was


---------80:26----------
maybe a little bit more


---------80:28----------
hurtful or gained traction than i


---------80:31----------
intended no no it wasn't hurtful it's


---------80:34----------
just my that's just


---------80:35----------
how my body copes with i guess physical


---------80:37----------
stress too is like


---------80:39----------
emotional crying and stuff no that


---------80:42----------
doesn't make sense to me so because what


---------80:44----------
triggered


---------80:45----------
your response is something that was


---------80:47----------
emotional in origin


---------80:51----------
your body copes so it's a cycle like i


---------80:53----------
said something and then that triggered


---------80:55----------
an emotional response


---------80:57----------
does that make sense maybe just like


---------81:00----------
part of it could be also like knowing


---------81:02----------
that i have to change and also being


---------81:04----------
like


---------81:04----------
scared to actually do it yep that i can


---------81:08----------
get behind


---------81:09----------
what are you scared of


---------81:13----------
i don't really know i guess failing


---------81:17----------
yeah see you're doing a good job


---------81:21----------
so now we know there's fear right that's


---------81:24----------
what you're feeling


---------81:25----------
there's tension but there's also fear


---------81:28----------
yeah i guess like there's so many like


---------81:30----------
different aspects of like


---------81:32----------
the way the physical and emotional and


---------81:34----------
like ambition and stuff that it just


---------81:35----------
kind of like is very confusing to


---------81:37----------
process


---------81:38----------
yeah i completely agree so i think you


---------81:41----------
have a lot


---------81:42----------
of emotions that you've stuck in your


---------81:45----------
basement


---------81:46----------
or attic because we're in texas and we


---------81:48----------
don't have basements


---------81:50----------
yeah and i think the problem is like


---------81:53----------
just like cleaning out your attic or


---------81:55----------
garage


---------81:56----------
when you go in there and you've stuffed


---------81:58----------
a lot of stuff in there it can feel


---------82:00----------
really really overwhelming and there's


---------82:03----------
fear and there's ambition there's hope


---------82:05----------
there's responsibility there's duty


---------82:11----------
the coping mechanism is to just like


---------82:13----------
suppress all of it and just keep like


---------82:16----------
burying yourself into work yep


---------82:19----------
very insightful


---------82:22----------
right and that's not going to work on


---------82:26----------
i didn't mean to be sound condescending


---------82:27----------
but sorry no


---------82:29----------
fine i say that to males that i work


---------82:32----------
with too


---------82:33----------
i say dude and hun kind of


---------82:35----------
interchangeably i try to be gender equal


---------82:39----------
i have so i will call women dudes and i


---------82:41----------
will call men


---------82:42----------
hun yeah and therefore i offend everyone


---------82:45----------
equally


---------82:48----------
do you mind if i ask how old are you 26.


---------82:54----------
yeah and are there people that can


---------82:57----------
like do you have support in your life


---------83:01----------
um i guess like my parents are generally


---------83:05----------
supportive you know


---------83:06----------
but like i guess i don't really talk to


---------83:08----------
many people so it's like yeah and no


---------83:10----------
like in theory supportive but like not


---------83:12----------
like on a daily basis


---------83:15----------
do you share your struggles with anyone


---------83:19----------
not really what does that feel like i


---------83:23----------
can't talk back so huh my dogs can't


---------83:26----------
talk back


---------83:27----------
so yeah um i don't know


---------83:31----------
i guess you'd kind of not tend not to


---------83:33----------
think about it when you don't practice


---------83:34----------
doing it right if you just suppress


---------83:36----------
everything and


---------83:37----------
just keep working and you don't have


---------83:39----------
time to think about it you don't realize


---------83:41----------
how much it's like


---------83:42----------
[ __ ] up up there yeah


---------83:49----------
i want you to take a deep breath


---------83:55----------
good slow exhalation


---------84:03----------
it's hard for me to like physically deep


---------84:04----------
breathe deeply which i think contributes


---------84:06----------
a lot to anxiety


---------84:08----------
what makes it hard for you to physically


---------84:09----------
deep breathe deeply


---------84:11----------
like my nose doesn't inhale air very


---------84:13----------
much and when i do it through my mouth


---------84:14----------
it feels like i can't get it quite to my


---------84:16----------
diaphragm like it's very drying


---------84:19----------
okay


---------84:22----------
okay so what i want you to do is slow


---------84:24----------
down your exhalation


---------84:28----------
so


---------84:37----------
really slow slower okay


---------84:46----------
slower tiny tiny tiny tiny


---------84:50----------
huh it feels like i'm running out of air


---------84:52----------
to exhale


---------84:59----------
good it feels like you're running out of


---------85:02----------
air to exhale or do you feel hungry for


---------85:04----------
air at the end of your exhalation


---------85:07----------
both like i feel like it needs to be


---------85:09----------
longer and that i need more immediately


---------85:16----------
so it sounds like taking deep breaths is


---------85:18----------
actually somewhat uncomfortable for you


---------85:20----------
yeah interesting


---------85:25----------
i think it's because like with my nose


---------85:27----------
it's like it wasn't as bad when i was a


---------85:29----------
kid so my whole life


---------85:30----------
i've been used to nose breathing i've


---------85:32----------
never developed like the mouth breathing


---------85:33----------
except like i guess maybe when i'm


---------85:35----------
asleep and don't realize it


---------85:37----------
but like as i get older i feel like it's


---------85:39----------
becoming more of an issue so it's like


---------85:41----------
i'm having to shift it and it's


---------85:43----------
uncomfortable too because i've built it


---------85:45----------
up the other way


---------85:46----------
can you do me a favor can you pinch the


---------85:48----------
tip of your nose like this and then


---------85:52----------
breathe


---------85:54----------
it's like a little better i've noticed


---------85:55----------
that too when i like shift my nostrils a


---------85:57----------
certain way i can get more air through


---------85:58----------
it


---------85:59----------
just pinch and take a deep breath


---------86:08----------
i just realized how ridiculous we look i


---------86:11----------
know


---------86:12----------
can you notice a difference though yeah


---------86:15----------
it's a little easier


---------86:18----------
okay interesting yeah


---------86:22----------
so kate you know i think of all of the


---------86:24----------
conversations i've ever had on stream


---------86:25----------
this feels to me to be the most


---------86:27----------
incomplete what do you think about that


---------86:32----------
what do you mean by incomplete i feel


---------86:34----------
like we have a lot more left to talk


---------86:36----------
about


---------86:38----------
what do you think yeah probably


---------86:42----------
i would say so just like i guess because


---------86:44----------
i'm a unique case most people don't like


---------86:47----------
do this type of like constantly for


---------86:49----------
years yeah


---------86:52----------
what comes up when you say that


---------86:56----------
exhaustion a little bit and like sadness


---------86:59----------
for myself


---------87:01----------
you sound really tired to me


---------87:05----------
i joke with chad i'm always tired


---------87:07----------
they're like how do you keep having


---------87:08----------
energy


---------87:09----------
when aren't you tired by now i'm like no


---------87:11----------
i'm always tired


---------87:12----------
you know it's like the hulk thing he's


---------87:13----------
always mad


---------87:19----------
what's it like to be tired all the time


---------87:24----------
just overwhelming to my system like i


---------87:25----------
don't even know why i'm crying it's not


---------87:27----------
that i'm sad it's just like my system is


---------87:29----------
physically overwhelmed


---------87:34----------
i think you've gotten so good at


---------87:36----------
suppressing that your body is like hey


---------87:38----------
we have a bunch of emotions


---------87:40----------
and then your mind is like uh-uh and


---------87:43----------
then your body's like okay we gotta put


---------87:44----------
them somewhere and they come


---------87:45----------
out through your body yeah probably


---------87:50----------
i've been like this too since i was a


---------87:52----------
kid like you know this is like if my mom


---------87:54----------
was like


---------87:55----------
yelling at me to clean my room or


---------87:57----------
something like just any kind of


---------87:58----------
confrontation and it might be because my


---------88:00----------
breathing problem just induces more


---------88:02----------
anxiety i'm not quite sure


---------88:03----------
like just like mundane parental


---------88:06----------
conversations i would just start crying


---------88:08----------
and it's not like a sad thing she's not


---------88:10----------
like insulting me it's just like any


---------88:12----------
type of like confrontation where i'm


---------88:13----------
like


---------88:14----------
having to do something i didn't like


---------88:16----------
naturally want to do because i'm like a


---------88:18----------
messy kid it's just like constant


---------88:20----------
crying yeah


---------88:23----------
kate have you thought about working with


---------88:24----------
a therapist or do you work with a


---------88:25----------
therapist


---------88:27----------
no i thought about it i haven't done it


---------88:29----------
yet


---------88:30----------
what's gotten oh i can probably answer


---------88:33----------
this but what's


---------88:34----------
what's kept you from here


---------88:37----------
if i've been paying attention i should


---------88:38----------
know the answer already but


---------88:40----------
let's do give you the benefit of asking


---------88:42----------
you what's gotten in the way


---------88:45----------
i'm just working so much i guess the


---------88:47----------
time yeah


---------88:48----------
so i think you gotta really seriously


---------88:50----------
consider it and i think a couple hours


---------88:52----------
throughout the week like three or four


---------88:53----------
hours throughout the week i'd say


---------88:55----------
ideally every day


---------88:56----------
you got a schedule as part of your job


---------88:58----------
something to take care of yourself


---------89:00----------
yeah because you owe that to kate


---------89:04----------
yeah absolutely it's really weird


---------89:06----------
because i think people whenever you cry


---------89:08----------
perceive like you're really sad and i'm


---------89:09----------
like


---------89:10----------
i'm not even sad i'm just like


---------89:11----------
physically overwhelmed


---------89:13----------
i feel like i'm not like emotional about


---------89:15----------
a certain thing at the moment


---------89:17----------
you know like all things considered i


---------89:19----------
have a pretty like


---------89:20----------
good outlook on life you know i'm like


---------89:23----------
yeah i'm really lucky to be here i have


---------89:24----------
all my


---------89:25----------
stuff in order and stuff i know i don't


---------89:27----------
take care of myself but i'm not like


---------89:28----------
emotionally torn up about anything at


---------89:30----------
the moment it's just like my body


---------89:32----------
expresses being overwhelmed with crying


---------89:35----------
yep


---------89:35----------
so i and it's my belief okay that


---------89:39----------
you do have part of that that over


---------89:41----------
physical feeling of overwhelmed


---------89:44----------
is probably like emotion that as you


---------89:47----------
kind of have hinted that is suppressed


---------89:50----------
right because when like how does it feel


---------89:52----------
to be tired you said tired and


---------89:54----------
sad there's some guilt there's some fear


---------89:57----------
i imagine there's a lot of a thing it's


---------90:00----------
more of like


---------90:02----------
i guess it's like a different type of


---------90:03----------
sadness it's not like you know like oh


---------90:05----------
no everything is terrible it's more of


---------90:07----------
like oh


---------90:08----------
it sucks that like i'm losing myself


---------90:10----------
kind of like


---------90:12----------
sorrow for like my personality i guess


---------90:14----------
yeah it


---------90:15----------
that is very sad right


---------90:19----------
just listening to that person it's just


---------90:21----------
like a sad thing


---------90:22----------
it's it's hard to put into words yeah so


---------90:25----------
it's almost as if you're like not


---------90:27----------
connected to that person it's almost


---------90:29----------
like it almost sounds like dissociative


---------90:31----------
to me


---------90:32----------
a little bit you know like you're like


---------90:34----------
oh it's like it's sad that that's


---------90:35----------
happening to kate


---------90:37----------
oh well back to editing youtube videos


---------90:39----------
exactly


---------90:40----------
right and and that's that's that's the


---------90:42----------
crux of what we're talking about today


---------90:44----------
is like you've


---------90:45----------
you've lost touch with yourself


---------90:50----------
and i think part of what keeps you from


---------90:52----------
re-engaging


---------90:53----------
is because like if you re-engage you


---------90:56----------
mentioned fear


---------90:57----------
i think part of what you could be afraid


---------90:59----------
of is like


---------91:01----------
the torrent of stuff that's gonna come


---------91:03----------
if you engage


---------91:05----------
if you reconnect with kate amaranth is


---------91:09----------
afraid of getting bowled over


---------91:13----------
yeah and if you fall apart as amaranth


---------91:15----------
then everything you've worked for


---------91:18----------
gets blown away


---------91:22----------
and so why would you risk connecting


---------91:24----------
with kate


---------91:31----------
i'm sorry i don't have more for you oh


---------91:34----------
no it's fine


---------91:35----------
i i not really i don't have expectations


---------91:38----------
i just feel like it's good i'm sure


---------91:39----------
there's like a lot of people who


---------91:41----------
make content who like feel similarly


---------91:43----------
like the grind is like


---------91:45----------
taking away part of what made them them


---------91:47----------
before the social media


---------91:49----------
grind began and they just don't know how


---------91:51----------
to talk about it or two to talk to or if


---------91:53----------
they even can because they sound like


---------91:54----------
ungrateful little [ __ ] and


---------91:56----------
yep i was gonna you know i've been


---------91:58----------
waiting for an opportunity to ask if you


---------92:00----------
sound if you feel that way


---------92:03----------
do you feel like an ungrateful little


---------92:05----------
[ __ ] i mean i don't


---------92:07----------
i don't feel like i am i'm just afraid


---------92:09----------
of like if you


---------92:10----------
talk about this a lot are you perceived


---------92:12----------
that way right it's like if you're like


---------92:14----------
man


---------92:14----------
it's so like it's so uh i guess


---------92:18----------
exhausting to be able to do what you


---------92:20----------
want for a living day in and day out


---------92:22----------
with no one to tell you otherwise and


---------92:24----------
get to make a lot of money doing that


---------92:25----------
yeah it must be


---------92:26----------
must be really terrible you little [ __ ]


---------92:28----------
type of thing


---------92:29----------
it's like people it's a reaction to it


---------92:32----------
like oh yeah


---------92:33----------
try shoveling [ __ ] in the street for 12


---------92:35----------
hours see if you prefer that you


---------92:36----------
ungrateful [ __ ]


---------92:38----------
so i feel like people would be


---------92:41----------
yeah the internet the internet loves it


---------92:44----------
when content creators


---------92:46----------
don't get to be human yeah they hate


---------92:49----------
treating you like humans


---------92:52----------
go like there's a lot of gatekeeping


---------92:54----------
around suffering too


---------92:57----------
you know we say like oh you're not


---------92:59----------
allowed to suffer


---------93:01----------
because you have it better than other


---------93:03----------
people which is just not true


---------93:05----------
unfortunately if only it were true


---------93:09----------
any kind of apologies if this has been a


---------93:11----------
little bit of meandering on my end but


---------93:13----------
like any kind of takeaways or anything


---------93:16----------
that you felt was helpful from today's


---------93:17----------
conversation


---------93:21----------
um just reconfirming that my feelings


---------93:24----------
aren't


---------93:25----------
ungrateful and crazy and that it would


---------93:26----------
be understandable to feel that way


---------93:29----------
yeah i think very much so


---------93:33----------
i think not only is that understandable


---------93:35----------
i think you deserve to feel that way and


---------93:37----------
i think you should feel that way and i


---------93:38----------
think it's okay to feel that way


---------93:42----------
yeah and i don't think that anything


---------93:45----------
that you


---------93:46----------
do invalidates any of the things that


---------93:49----------
you feel


---------93:50----------
i don't think that your gratitude your


---------93:52----------
luck your empire or anything


---------93:55----------
obs like takes away the right for you to


---------93:58----------
feel the way that you do


---------94:01----------
and i do think you're gonna need courage


---------94:04----------
and


---------94:04----------
practice not discipline don't need


---------94:06----------
[ __ ] discipline


---------94:07----------
discipline isn't for people like us


---------94:10----------
you don't need it because i have not a


---------94:13----------
good amount of that


---------94:15----------
yep right and i'm sure people watching


---------94:16----------
would be very confused because what they


---------94:18----------
see is someone who works like 16 to 18


---------94:20----------
hours a day


---------94:21----------
right 20 hours a day they're like how is


---------94:23----------
this person not disciplined


---------94:26----------
it's not disgusting i don't know how to


---------94:28----------
take time off


---------94:29----------
yeah it's like robot hyper focus yep


---------94:32----------
and so some people robot hyper focus on


---------94:35----------
video games you robot hyper focus on


---------94:37----------
streaming


---------94:38----------
and people are envious of


---------94:41----------
people who happen to hyper focus on


---------94:43----------
things that lead to


---------94:45----------
monetary success which is fair but at


---------94:48----------
the end of the day i feel like you're


---------94:49----------
just as out of control as someone who's


---------94:51----------
like addicted to video games and playing


---------94:53----------
at home because you're not in control


---------94:55----------
you're consumed you're on autopilot


---------94:59----------
so yeah and


---------95:02----------
you know kate like i said i'm i'm sorry


---------95:04----------
that i feel like there's still a lot to


---------95:06----------
cover in terms of like practically


---------95:08----------
i think i'm gonna make a note based on


---------95:11----------
our conversation


---------95:12----------
today about like if you're completely


---------95:14----------
stuck on autopilot and living a life


---------95:16----------
whether it be a grind or video games


---------95:18----------
like practically how do you get started


---------95:21----------
and the first thing


---------95:22----------
so i think i'm gonna think about this


---------95:24----------
and try to maybe make like a


---------95:26----------
video or something but the first thing


---------95:27----------
that i would encourage you to do


---------95:29----------
is to make set aside sometime in your


---------95:31----------
day schedule


---------95:33----------
time for yourself is part of your job


---------95:36----------
okay you know and and like even if it's


---------95:39----------
like


---------95:40----------
and even like 30 30-minute meal time is


---------95:42----------
like not a bad idea we haven't talked at


---------95:43----------
all about food but i don't know if you


---------95:45----------
eat and take care of it i don't


---------95:49----------
i only eat on the stream because i never


---------95:52----------
i moved into this house maybe like


---------95:54----------
a year and a half ago almost two years


---------95:56----------
now maybe and i never bought


---------95:58----------
a table and chairs because i'm always


---------95:59----------
working so i eat at my desk


---------96:02----------
when i'm working


---------96:05----------
okay any questions for me


---------96:11----------
um not really i guess if uh


---------96:15----------
you want to have like an another talk if


---------96:17----------
since you feel it's incomplete i'm


---------96:18----------
always open


---------96:19----------
yeah how do you feel about that


---------96:23----------
i think it would be good be a fun fun


---------96:25----------
endeavor for me too


---------96:26----------
like i like talking about it even if i


---------96:28----------
cry through some of it it's still like


---------96:30----------
enjoyable for me to discuss things like


---------96:33----------
that


---------96:34----------
i find them insightful good for a lot of


---------96:37----------
people who


---------96:38----------
don't have that avenue to talk about it


---------96:40----------
so


---------96:41----------
i i think that that could be really


---------96:43----------
useful okay


---------96:44----------
i think the the because what i felt from


---------96:47----------
our conversation today is that there's a


---------96:49----------
lot of like really practical stuff


---------96:51----------
there's sort of like some emotional


---------96:53----------
stuff like i would have loved to dig in


---------96:55----------
and get to a particular emotion


---------96:57----------
but oddly enough i don't think that like


---------96:59----------
discovering a particular emotion


---------97:00----------
is the most important thing for you i


---------97:03----------
think the most important thing for you


---------97:05----------
is for you to like literally schedule


---------97:07----------
time to take care of yourself throughout


---------97:09----------
the day


---------97:10----------
yeah and and like i know it sounds small


---------97:14----------
but like the cool thing is that you've


---------97:15----------
built this


---------97:16----------
monster and you can build a different


---------97:18----------
one


---------97:20----------
the one where you take care of yourself


---------97:21----------
and i do think you can find balance in


---------97:23----------
your case


---------97:24----------
kate it's all about a lack of balance


---------97:27----------
yeah


---------97:28----------
and generally speaking when people are


---------97:29----------
unbalanced i don't think they're as


---------97:32----------
successful


---------97:34----------
yeah do you want to learn how to


---------97:38----------
meditate today


---------97:40----------
sure so i'm a little bit reluctant to


---------97:44----------
teach you a breathing meditation


---------97:49----------
i mean i can always try yeah but that's


---------97:52----------
okay we don't have to teach you a


---------97:53----------
breathing meditation


---------97:54----------
so i actually what i'm going to teach


---------97:55----------
you is something also a little bit more


---------97:57----------
practical so i want you to sit up


---------98:00----------
straight so you said you have a lot of


---------98:02----------
tension in your neck


---------98:04----------
yeah what i want you to do is tuck your


---------98:08----------
chin


---------98:08----------
towards your throat yeah like that so


---------98:11----------
you


---------98:11----------
feel like you're kind of the back of


---------98:13----------
your head is kind of stiffening up


---------98:15----------
does that make sense like tuck your chin


---------98:17----------
towards like


---------98:18----------
you know where your atoms would be and


---------98:21----------
now i want you to


---------98:22----------
hold that spot hold that tightness like


---------98:25----------
in terms of


---------98:26----------
you know you're not you're kind of yeah


---------98:28----------
like kind of like looking down


---------98:29----------
almost and then i want you to turn your


---------98:32----------
head to the side this could be hard with


---------98:33----------
headphones


---------98:36----------
but keep it tucked up and tell me what


---------98:38----------
you feel


---------98:41----------
[Music]


---------98:43----------
not um an incredible amount of soreness


---------98:45----------
just because i do exercises a lot for


---------98:47----------
this


---------98:47----------
i just i still like feel it when i'm


---------98:49----------
like supposed to be like in a resting


---------98:51----------
position i like feel my body being held


---------98:53----------
tense but it's not actually sore


---------98:55----------
yeah i understand so so and then come


---------98:57----------
back to the middle


---------98:59----------
okay so and then go to the other side so


---------99:01----------
keep your chin tucked and then turn


---------99:04----------
and then you should feel something along


---------99:06----------
like either here


---------99:08----------
or on the back side do you feel that


---------99:11----------
yeah probably the back side


---------99:13----------
and then come back to the middle


---------99:16----------
and then this way


---------99:24----------
and then back to the middle then go


---------99:26----------
ahead and close your eyes


---------99:29----------
okay and now we're going to go to the


---------99:31----------
other side


---------99:39----------
and just focus on that sensation


---------99:42----------
of the tightness yep


---------99:50----------
and then back to the middle


---------99:54----------
and then over to your left right


---------100:02----------
and notice that as you tuck your chin in


---------100:04----------
a little bit more


---------100:05----------
you may feel an increased sense of


---------100:07----------
tightness


---------100:11----------
keep that chin nice and tucked


---------100:15----------
and now back to the middle


---------100:19----------
and then over to the other side


---------100:26----------
now as we're doing this your mind may


---------100:28----------
start to wander


---------100:30----------
especially as we go through subsequent


---------100:31----------
rounds


---------100:33----------
so just notice those thoughts


---------100:38----------
now back to the middle and let yourself


---------100:42----------
flew back in so now just go ahead and


---------100:44----------
relax for a second let your


---------100:46----------
chin relax eyes closed


---------100:50----------
and now feel your body


---------100:55----------
i still feel the tension a little bit on


---------100:58----------
like the back


---------100:58----------
on both sides okay so just go ahead and


---------101:02----------
let your shoulders hang down


---------101:07----------
like imagine like your arms are actually


---------101:10----------
sleeves


---------101:11----------
on a piece of clothing hanging on a


---------101:13----------
hanger


---------101:15----------
so don't hold them up just let them hang


---------101:17----------
good


---------101:24----------
now what i want you to do is take a deep


---------101:26----------
breath in


---------101:27----------
and push out your diaphragm


---------101:32----------
and then out good you can use nose or


---------101:36----------
mouth whichever you prefer


---------101:40----------
deep breath in


---------101:43----------
and out


---------101:49----------
and again


---------102:04----------
now i want you to sit with the person


---------102:06----------
that you are


---------102:16----------
try to figure out who is this


---------102:19----------
who are you right now is this kate


---------102:24----------
this is amaranth


---------102:28----------
is this the future starter of your


---------102:31----------
animal rescue sanctuary


---------102:38----------
is this a girl from texas


---------102:43----------
just be with whoever you are


---------102:48----------
let your palms be face up


---------102:56----------
feel the warmth in your hands


---------103:02----------
try to stay nice and straight with your


---------103:05----------
spine but let the rest of you relax


---------103:09----------
now we're going to take a deep breath in


---------103:10----------
and we're going to raise our shoulders


---------103:12----------
during the breath


---------103:14----------
spike up your shoulders and then as you


---------103:16----------
exhale let them come down a second time


---------103:25----------
deep breath in


---------103:29----------
and then out and relax


---------103:35----------
and then third time


---------103:41----------
and out


---------103:48----------
now in the space afterwards


---------103:52----------
go ahead and notice what thoughts may


---------103:54----------
come


---------103:57----------
and i'll try to trigger some think about


---------104:00----------
all the work that you could be doing


---------104:04----------
all the things that you can


---------104:10----------
and invite those thoughts to come invite


---------104:13----------
the beast


---------104:14----------
of duty responsibility of being


---------104:17----------
trapped of having a mission


---------104:21----------
trying to make the world a better place


---------104:24----------
all of those big thoughts with a capital


---------104:27----------
b and a capital t


---------104:30----------
all of those things that are more


---------104:32----------
important than kate


---------104:36----------
all of those things can be there but


---------104:38----------
they just just exist in your head


---------104:41----------
that you are actually more than those


---------104:43----------
thoughts


---------104:45----------
whatever your goals are whatever your


---------104:47----------
aspirations are


---------104:49----------
whatever you strive to be


---------104:54----------
that all of those are just located in a


---------104:57----------
tiny tiny


---------104:58----------
part of you that there's so much


---------105:01----------
more to you than those things


---------105:11----------
and now we'll do the last phase of our


---------105:14----------
exercise today


---------105:17----------
and that's going to be what i want you


---------105:18----------
to do is open your eyes for a second and


---------105:20----------
look at me


---------105:22----------
so keep your arms by your sides let them


---------105:24----------
hang down


---------105:27----------
and then as we breathe in what we're


---------105:28----------
going to do is actually i'm going to put


---------105:30----------
my arms up


---------105:34----------
and then touch them up top like a


---------105:36----------
namaste


---------105:37----------
and then as you exhale


---------105:44----------
let them come out good


---------105:48----------
and then again breathe in


---------105:53----------
and then out


---------105:59----------
now close your eyes we're going to do


---------106:01----------
three more


---------106:03----------
and try to match the arms with your


---------106:06----------
inhalations as they come up


---------106:10----------
as you fill up air your fingers should


---------106:12----------
touch and as you exhale


---------106:16----------
as your breath finishes your hands are


---------106:19----------
by your sides


---------106:22----------
two more deep breath in


---------106:28----------
and then out


---------106:35----------
then last one


---------106:52----------
and now we'll sit in silence for a few


---------106:54----------
minutes


---------106:59----------
add 60 seconds


---------108:10----------
when you're ready go ahead and open your


---------108:16----------
eyes


---------108:19----------
it's bright yeah


---------108:24----------
world is a different place


---------108:31----------
so kate one last thing that i'll leave


---------108:33----------
you with


---------108:35----------
reality isn't what you think it is all


---------108:38----------
that [ __ ] is just thoughts


---------108:42----------
i don't know if that makes sense to you


---------108:44----------
but like this is really what you are


---------108:47----------
and i think you should work hard every


---------108:48----------
day but


---------108:50----------
nothing i mean this this goal that you


---------108:54----------
have is the light at the end of the


---------108:55----------
tunnel and it's not worth sacrificing


---------108:58----------
today for


---------109:01----------
because the scary thing is sometimes the


---------109:02----------
light at the end of the tunnel is


---------109:03----------
actually another train


---------109:06----------
yeah uh what was that practice like for


---------109:12----------
you


---------109:14----------
i guess less tints


---------109:19----------
a little more like relieving of the


---------109:22----------
tension


---------109:23----------
good what was your mind doing


---------109:26----------
not really anything great that's the


---------109:30----------
point


---------109:31----------
that's why we meditate to give yourself


---------109:33----------
a break from your mind


---------109:35----------
because your mind does a lot to you it


---------109:37----------
does a lot for you


---------109:39----------
so take a break from it from time to


---------109:41----------
time


---------109:43----------
yeah for me i have even though i have


---------109:46----------
add


---------109:46----------
since i have breathing problems if i


---------109:48----------
have to concentrate on breathing that's


---------109:50----------
the only thing i can do


---------109:52----------
because it's so difficult to actually


---------109:53----------
breathe so it kind of counteracts


---------109:55----------
the issue sounds uncomfortable to have


---------109:58----------
breathing problems


---------110:00----------
yeah yeah cool well any


---------110:03----------
last questions for me before we wrap up


---------110:05----------
for the day


---------110:08----------
uh no i think that's pretty good here


---------110:11----------
um do you mind if we follow up with you


---------110:13----------
about whether you went horseback riding


---------110:15----------
next week


---------110:16----------
sure would that keep you more


---------110:19----------
accountable


---------110:21----------
probably should we should we do it or


---------110:24----------
should we ask your viewers to do it


---------110:28----------
um maybe both


---------110:32----------
okay schedule they can include it


---------110:36----------
yeah because i schedule weekly so


---------110:39----------
a lot of what you stream is for them


---------110:41----------
right and so let them help you out too


---------110:45----------
yeah and maybe your viewers can do


---------110:48----------
something for themselves during the same


---------110:50----------
hour that


---------110:51----------
you know stalkers and stuff aside i


---------110:52----------
don't know how much information you can


---------110:54----------
freely give out but


---------110:55----------
if you're planning on doing something to


---------110:56----------
take care of yourself i think it'd be


---------110:58----------
really awesome if your community could


---------110:59----------
do the same thing


---------111:01----------
and then you guys could like meet and


---------111:02----------
kind of check in with each other about


---------111:04----------
doing it yeah that'd be nice


---------111:08----------
cool thank you very much for coming on


---------111:11----------
and i hope we were able to help in some


---------111:13----------
small way


---------111:14----------
yeah definitely it's good to know that


---------111:17----------
i'm not crazy yet


---------111:18----------
just close but not there yet we're good


---------111:20----------
no i think you're the very opposite of


---------111:22----------
crazy i think you're


---------111:24----------
a normal wonderful person who has had


---------111:28----------
life social media and streaming get to


---------111:30----------
them because that's what it does


---------111:35----------
and i think underneath i hope you'll be


---------111:38----------
able to find some kind of balance


---------111:39----------
between kate and amaranth


---------111:41----------
instead of leaving her at home yep


---------111:45----------
just gotta work on it it has to be


---------111:46----------
something that i do proactively because


---------111:48----------
it's not going to happen if i just keep


---------111:51----------
being like at some point sure damn


---------111:53----------
straight


---------111:55----------
wise words okay wise words and something


---------111:58----------
that i think everyone can take home


---------111:59----------
taking care of yourself is not something


---------112:01----------
that happens on autopilot it's something


---------112:03----------
that you do


---------112:06----------
so good luck with that thank you i


---------112:08----------
really appreciate it


---------112:09----------
take care you too


---------112:21----------
you
