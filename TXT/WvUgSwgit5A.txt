---------00:00----------
Natalia okay yeah great so Natalia tell


---------00:03----------
me a little bit about how you're doing


---------00:07----------
today and what we're talking about okay


---------00:09----------
um I'm super nervous because I'm


---------00:13----------
probably gonna cry because like okay um


---------00:16----------
so me too nice


---------00:19----------
yeah yeah I like I cry a lot I really is


---------00:23----------
thank you about cries to make me cry so


---------00:25----------
I think it's gonna be tears um is it


---------00:28----------
okay to cry yeah I cry all the time so


---------00:32----------
yeah I'm not embarrassed of crying


---------00:34----------
anymore I guess


---------00:35----------
okay um but yeah I've just been having


---------00:39----------
like a really difficult time lately and


---------00:42----------
I think I wanted to talk about mainly


---------00:45----------
like two things that okay maybe overlap


---------00:47----------
a little bit sure


---------00:49----------
okay so the first part is um I'm bipolar


---------00:53----------
okay um I've been diagnosed for about


---------01:00----------
like four years okay right I've


---------01:03----------
struggled with like mental health issues


---------01:05----------
my whole life okay


---------01:07----------
um I had an eating disorder when I was


---------01:10----------
14 okay um


---------01:13----------
and I I got was 50 kilos before and by


---------01:19----------
the time I was 16 I was 23


---------01:22----------
so yeah I was pretty rough


---------01:25----------
I nearly died and I recovered from that


---------01:29----------
at about 16 and then I was bulimic from


---------01:34----------
16 til about 22 no until about like


---------01:42----------
that's not true okay I was I was like a


---------01:45----------
type of bulimia I don't really want to


---------01:47----------
talk about it but I was sure one type of


---------01:49----------
bulimia until 22 and I'm from 22 to like


---------01:53----------
25 I was a different type of bulimic and


---------01:56----------
then um in 2017


---------02:04----------
that's 2016 that's when I got diagnosed


---------02:07----------
bipolar and when I started my medication


---------02:09----------
my bulimia actually went away okay um


---------02:13----------
yeah so sorry like your you have


---------02:16----------
treatment providers right now that


---------02:18----------
you're connected with them yeah I've


---------02:21----------
been on remission like I saw my


---------02:24----------
psychiatrist for like a whole year


---------02:27----------
oh gosh the one that diagnosed me


---------02:29----------
bipolar and I am oh she put me on


---------02:36----------
remission after a year because I was


---------02:37----------
pretty stable


---------02:38----------
um I take lamotrigine take 100


---------02:44----------
milligrams a day okay so yeah I have a


---------02:50----------
like I think it's type 2 so I cycle


---------02:54----------
really quickly


---------02:56----------
ah really really really really really


---------02:58----------
quickly I sometimes have to hypomanic


---------03:02----------
episodes within a month and then to


---------03:04----------
depressive episodes within a month my


---------03:06----------
medication has been really good at like


---------03:09----------
keeping my depression to like just a few


---------03:12----------
days so I can manage that way but my


---------03:16----------
issue mostly is with my hypomania


---------03:19----------
because I become very impulsive and


---------03:25----------
sometimes I like become a little like


---------03:29----------
mean I which is so not me okay um and I


---------03:34----------
sometimes like I wouldn't say I become


---------03:36----------
like aggressive but I become like it's


---------03:39----------
nice


---------03:39----------
snippy like I say things that I don't


---------03:42----------
mean saying to people and I do like very


---------03:47----------
um


---------03:48----------
like abrupt things that I don't think


---------03:51----------
about doing does that make sense


---------03:53----------
sure um I have like really racing


---------03:55----------
thoughts and sometimes it feels like


---------03:58----------
like especially when I'm asleep at night


---------04:02----------
it feels like my body is like


---------04:05----------
like my body is asleep but my mind isn't


---------04:08----------
asleep like it feels like my mind is


---------04:10----------
just like racing all the time so that's


---------04:13----------
like my main issue right now it's like


---------04:16----------
dealing with the consequences of the


---------04:20----------
things that I do when I'm hypomanic um I


---------04:24----------
start a lot of things that I don't


---------04:25----------
finish and I started a lot of projects


---------04:28----------
that then I don't want to do and so like


---------04:30----------
hmm that causes some issues and then the


---------04:34----------
interplay of that within my stream and


---------04:38----------
like


---------04:41----------
internet culture in general


---------04:44----------
so that's kind of what I'm struggling


---------04:46----------
right now like I think that my bipolar I


---------04:48----------
have it under control but the stress of


---------04:52----------
my job is making it really difficult to


---------04:55----------
handle okay so thank you so much for


---------05:02----------
sharing all that that's all yeah so let


---------05:05----------
me just start by offering kind of a


---------05:07----------
couple of perspectives so the first


---------05:10----------
thing is you know I think we a lot of


---------05:12----------
people have been asking important


---------05:14----------
questions about whether what we do on


---------05:15----------
stream is is therapy or not therapy or


---------05:18----------
mental health treatment so I just want


---------05:20----------
to make it clear so you have providers


---------05:22----------
so I'm not going to comment on the


---------05:24----------
management of your bipolar disorder


---------05:26----------
whether you have bipolar disorder things


---------05:28----------
like that's that I think is about you


---------05:30----------
know that's medical and I'm glad that


---------05:32----------
you have people with that that can help


---------05:34----------
you with that I think what I would like


---------05:37----------
to talk to you about is is I think this


---------05:39----------
is actually a perfect example of how I


---------05:41----------
still think I can help you because I


---------05:43----------
think there could be stuff going on here


---------05:45----------
that is actually not bipolar disorder


---------05:47----------
okay so if we think about like like so


---------05:50----------
what I really try to do here on stream


---------05:52----------
is help people understand how their mind


---------05:54----------
works and and what I'm hearing from you


---------05:57----------
is that sometimes your mind acts


---------05:58----------
impulsively that you exhibit means


---------06:03----------
behaviors and in my experience I think


---------06:07----------
that meanness and impulsivity don't have


---------06:10----------
to come from bipolar disorder


---------06:12----------
does that make sense but I am so not


---------06:16----------
like that sometimes yep I understand


---------06:18----------
that there are fluctuations within your


---------06:20----------
mood I'm not blaming you for it but what


---------06:22----------
I'm saying is that adjusting your


---------06:24----------
medication may not be the only way to


---------06:27----------
improve that because all of us are mean


---------06:30----------
or impulsive at times and there may be


---------06:32----------
something going on with bipolar disorder


---------06:34----------
that makes you act more mean or


---------06:36----------
impulsive but it's a dangerous


---------06:38----------
assumption to us to assume that that is


---------06:41----------
just bipolar and in my experience if you


---------06:45----------
think about regulating your impulses or


---------06:48----------
understanding where mean this comes from


---------06:50----------
that's something that all human beings


---------06:52----------
can do and improve those things and just


---------06:55----------
because you're bipolar doesn't mean


---------06:57----------
do those things too it just means that


---------06:59----------
those things may be harder for you to do


---------07:02----------
if you have by far does that make sense


---------07:04----------
yeah no I understand that but the thing


---------07:07----------
is like what I'm mostly struggling right


---------07:10----------
now and and like I think that I've been


---------07:12----------
able to like grow and change a lot to


---------07:15----------
get a point with like um I I do yoga and


---------07:20----------
I meditate awesome um and I'm becoming


---------07:24----------
like a very spiritual person cool and


---------07:28----------
it's helped me a lot to deal with it but


---------07:31----------
my biggest issue is with this eight


---------07:35----------
years of recordings that exists on the


---------07:38----------
Internet of my past and the past


---------07:42----------
experiences that I've had and people


---------07:44----------
judging me everyday by those things okay


---------07:47----------
so let's talk that that sounds like it's


---------07:50----------
really really hard to deal with because


---------07:52----------
most human beings get to make mistakes


---------07:56----------
right and they get to make mistakes and


---------08:00----------
they get to learn but when you have


---------08:02----------
eight years of recordings of your


---------08:04----------
mistakes sometimes you're not allowed to


---------08:06----------
make mistakes in the same way or you


---------08:08----------
never get to like really move past them


---------08:10----------
is that is that kind of what's going on


---------08:12----------
with you is yeah it's like I get to make


---------08:15----------
the mistakes every single day again and


---------08:17----------
again and again and again what does that


---------08:20----------
mean can you help me understand well


---------08:22----------
because people comment on them all the


---------08:24----------
time so I have to like relive them so


---------08:27----------
sometimes it feels like


---------08:30----------
every single day I'm reliving all those


---------08:33----------
moments okay so it sounds like you're


---------08:35----------
not really they're not letting you move


---------08:37----------
past it and you're kind of being


---------08:40----------
reminded every day of the mistakes that


---------08:41----------
you made yeah what's that like


---------08:47----------
it's a horrible


---------08:52----------
it's horrible because I'm trying to grow


---------08:55----------
and be better but


---------08:58----------
it feels like


---------09:04----------
okay I I can't move on that's how it


---------09:08----------
chilled yeah I mean it sounds like you


---------09:11----------
can't move on because people keep on


---------09:13----------
reminding you and bringing you back


---------09:15----------
there I mean I can't imagine I mean I I


---------09:19----------
really don't think that that's like


---------09:21----------
something you're doing wrong it sounds


---------09:23----------
like you know if I have so sometimes I


---------09:26----------
you know deal with people who suffered


---------09:30----------
from abuse and and you know I I remember


---------09:32----------
I mean I've heard this story like a


---------09:33----------
thousand times about you know a kid who


---------09:35----------
comes home and they've got a bad grade


---------09:37----------
on a report card and like one of their


---------09:39----------
parents starts yelling at them or


---------09:40----------
hitting them the next day they come home


---------09:43----------
and they hear the same thing like the


---------09:45----------
report card like they have the bad grade


---------09:46----------
and every day they're just reminded of


---------09:48----------
it over and over and over and over again


---------09:52----------
yeah even if the kid is studying more it


---------09:55----------
doesn't matter if they're studying


---------09:56----------
harder or working harder they're being


---------09:58----------
more if they're if they've actually made


---------10:00----------
steps to improve like the parent just


---------10:02----------
keeps on beating the crap out of them


---------10:05----------
sounds like that's what you're going


---------10:06----------
through yeah and like generally I've


---------10:11----------
I've been good at dealing with it I mean


---------10:15----------
I've been dealing with us for two years


---------10:16----------
now


---------10:17----------
weird literally every stream half the


---------10:21----------
messages I get are about that where


---------10:25----------
every single Instagram I post half the


---------10:28----------
messages are about that where every


---------10:31----------
single tweet I posed 90% of the messages


---------10:34----------
are horrible hateful things I get


---------10:37----------
messages every day from people telling


---------10:39----------
me to kill myself that I'm a [ __ ] that


---------10:42----------
I'm the worst thing that's ever happened


---------10:44----------
to twitch um and like it's not just one


---------10:48----------
it's not just two it's thousands of


---------10:51----------
thousands every single day um and I


---------10:54----------
sometimes I'm good sometimes I can


---------10:57----------
handle it but then some other times I


---------10:59----------
can do you know I'm so Natalia I'm


---------11:03----------
really kind of shocked by that and I'm


---------11:06----------
I'm really kind of wondering like where


---------11:08----------
does all that hatred come from do you um


---------11:13----------
like why do they hate you so much like I


---------11:18----------
find it hard to believe that unless


---------11:19----------
you're committing genocide that you know


---------11:21----------
you were deserving of thousands of


---------11:23----------
people just


---------11:33----------
I don't know


---------11:37----------
sometimes I feel like if I was like in


---------11:40----------
prison it would be easier


---------11:44----------
would be easier about present that at


---------11:48----------
least impress it and be like I'm getting


---------11:51----------
to pay for my mistakes in a way in which


---------11:55----------
I can move on it should get better and


---------11:58----------
work in myself but up it feels right now


---------12:04----------
that I'm like in hell


---------12:07----------
you know we're like every single day for


---------12:10----------
the rest of my life I'm gonna have to


---------12:12----------
deal with that and like it feels like my


---------12:15----------
only option is to just get up social


---------12:18----------
media completely but the problem is I


---------12:22----------
haven't done anything else with my life


---------12:24----------
like I I quit college for for twitch and


---------12:27----------
so like I would have to let my house go


---------12:31----------
I would have to let my pets go you know


---------12:33----------
like it's just not an option for me to


---------12:36----------
like go do something else you sound like


---------12:38----------
you're stuck yeah I it's also shocking


---------12:44----------
to hear you know someone say something


---------12:46----------
like I almost wish I could be in prison


---------12:48----------
because it sounds like if if there was


---------12:50----------
something what I'm hearing from you is


---------12:52----------
if there was something you could do to


---------12:56----------
show the people who hate you that you're


---------12:58----------
trying to atone or you're paying your


---------13:00----------
price or whatever then you would do it


---------13:02----------
but what I'm hearing from you is that


---------13:04----------
you know if they're telling you to kill


---------13:06----------
yourself there's really nothing you can


---------13:07----------
do to like appease them right it's like


---------13:10----------
there's no it's impossible


---------13:12----------
like what are they looking for from you


---------13:14----------
I can't imagine what would actually


---------13:16----------
satisfy them


---------13:18----------
well I killed myself and I thought about


---------13:21----------
it so many days so many times so I am I


---------13:28----------
already had a plan on how I was gonna do


---------13:30----------
it okay or you know or your providers


---------13:34----------
aware of that No okay can we talk for a


---------13:40----------
second about that mm-hmm


---------13:43----------
what keeps you from sharing that then I


---------13:46----------
haven't really seen like my psychiatrist


---------13:49----------
is like 2017 okay so maybe give them a


---------13:56----------
call and kind of let them know what


---------13:58----------
you're going through because I know as a


---------14:01----------
psychiatrist one of the things the the


---------14:03----------
most difficult thing about my job is


---------14:05----------
when I'm there to help someone and they


---------14:07----------
don't let me know that they need help


---------14:08----------
and and so if you're going through this


---------14:12----------
stuff I would strongly strongly


---------14:13----------
recommend that you reach out to your


---------14:15----------
psychiatrist and kind of let them know


---------14:17----------
that something is going on it doesn't


---------14:18----------
necessarily mean that they're gonna


---------14:19----------
change your medication or anything like


---------14:21----------
that I mean I'm not gonna be able to do


---------14:23----------
it because my friends literally like


---------14:26----------
they chased me around everywhere what do


---------14:29----------
you like my friends don't let me be


---------14:31----------
alone cuz they know you're talking about


---------14:35----------
you're not gonna be able to kill


---------14:36----------
yourself yeah okay well I'm not i I'm


---------14:40----------
not like I'm not left alone ever


---------14:43----------
okay so sorry that's reassuring and also


---------14:47----------
whether you're left alone or not I think


---------14:49----------
is actually like besides the point


---------14:51----------
because the point here is that you're


---------14:53----------
suffering and there may be things that


---------14:55----------
people can do for you or that you can do


---------14:58----------
for yourself to suffer less and I'm not


---------15:01----------
talking about winning over the hateful


---------15:03----------
people what I'm talking about as you


---------15:04----------
said you're becoming more spiritual so


---------15:06----------
like in a weird way I think this is a


---------15:08----------
conversation about meanness hatred


---------15:11----------
purpose how do you find a way to move


---------15:15----------
forward how do you deal with the hate of


---------15:16----------
other people because like I there's


---------15:19----------
something that sounds to me I just don't


---------15:21----------
think I can do it anymore I don't think


---------15:24----------
I can handle what they hate anymore


---------15:27----------
yeah so that makes sense to me that you


---------15:30----------
can't do that because I'm actually


---------15:33----------
shocked that you've been able to do it


---------15:34----------
this long like this sounds insane to me


---------15:37----------
like how have you been able to do it


---------15:40----------
this long


---------15:46----------
I don't know I guess I've been really


---------15:48----------
strong for a very long time hmm and then


---------15:52----------
like I just hit a point where it so many


---------15:55----------
things happened like one after the other


---------15:57----------
and then I just I don't know okay yeah


---------16:03----------
so what I'm asking you to do is lean on


---------16:05----------
the people whose job it is to help you


---------16:08----------
through this kind of thing so I'm not


---------16:11----------
I'm not so I'm not saying that like


---------16:13----------
reaching out to your psychiatrist is


---------16:15----------
separate from your friends not letting


---------16:17----------
you feel a lot like the point here is


---------16:19----------
like if they're not gonna let you kill


---------16:20----------
yourself that's great that's wonderful


---------16:21----------
that's awesome and at the same time it


---------16:24----------
is by belief that you don't have to feel


---------16:26----------
this way at least this much yeah anymore


---------16:31----------
and yet there going to be people around


---------16:34----------
myself included who can try to help you


---------16:36----------
understand you know how to think about


---------16:39----------
yourself how to move forward and I think


---------16:40----------
one of the important people in your life


---------16:42----------
is going to be your psychiatrist and


---------16:44----------
just let them know what's going on okay


---------16:46----------
and probably go see them because so hard


---------16:49----------
to explain to anybody what I'm dealing


---------16:51----------
with


---------16:52----------
the doesn't know twitch and doesn't know


---------16:54----------
social media yeah so so that's it you're


---------16:57----------
spot on it is very hard to explain it


---------17:00----------
but yeah this is this is where my


---------17:03----------
psychiatrist just like I don't know like


---------17:05----------
50 years old like how do I explain to


---------17:08----------
her why this is affecting me so much I


---------17:11----------
so here's the thing you gotta give him a


---------17:13----------
chance to understand okay and here's the


---------17:16----------
thing


---------17:16----------
so Natalia I think this is really


---------17:18----------
important if you can think about other


---------17:21----------
people in this moment I know this is


---------17:23----------
gonna sound bizarre but I I think the


---------17:26----------
world would be a better place the world


---------17:28----------
would be a better place if you told your


---------17:30----------
psychiatrist now why is that it's


---------17:33----------
because 50 year old psychiatrists are


---------17:35----------
gonna practice for another 20 years and


---------17:37----------
unless people like you try to explain it


---------17:40----------
to them they're not gonna get it and if


---------17:43----------
they get it think about how much more


---------17:45----------
they would be able to help all of the


---------17:48----------
other patients that they're seeing do


---------17:49----------
you think you're the only person and in


---------17:52----------
this person's practice that's dealing


---------17:53----------
with hate from social media your hate


---------17:55----------
may be way worse than everyone else's


---------17:57----------
but I can guarantee you because I


---------18:00----------
a [ __ ] psychiatrist and people come


---------18:01----------
into my office social media is tearing


---------18:04----------
everyone apart and so in a weird way if


---------18:09----------
you can I think it's almost like if you


---------18:11----------
can afford if you have any bandwidth


---------18:13----------
left to try to make the world a better


---------18:15----------
place which I don't blame you for if you


---------18:17----------
don't because it sounds like you're


---------18:18----------
running on empty you know talk to your


---------18:22----------
mental health provider and it's try to


---------18:24----------
explain that with them and if they don't


---------18:25----------
understand they don't understand and


---------18:26----------
then maybe you try to get a referral for


---------18:28----------
a therapist who's younger or something


---------18:29----------
like that and I'm happy to help you try


---------18:32----------
to problem-solve about you know trying


---------18:34----------
to find you good help if you know with


---------18:36----------
your psychiatrist and things like that


---------18:38----------
if you need help but I would strongly


---------18:40----------
encourage that you know you because you


---------18:42----------
just it's not fair for you to deal with


---------18:44----------
this [ __ ] because it sounds like you're


---------18:44----------
dealing with the [ __ ] alone do like who


---------18:48----------
supports you during this time like for


---------18:52----------
the past two years like who do you have


---------18:54----------
in your corner yeah not a lot of people


---------18:58----------
I have to like really close friends and


---------19:00----------
that's pretty much it yeah I have a


---------19:02----------
really good community like I have a lot


---------19:05----------
of people that love me you know like I


---------19:07----------
have I have a pretty strong community


---------19:10----------
that like shares a lot of love so that


---------19:13----------
does help and I I loved streaming I love


---------19:16----------
sharing my life and my love for life


---------19:18----------
with people but and like this whole time


---------19:22----------
I was just telling myself that I if I


---------19:25----------
hold on for a little longer things will


---------19:28----------
get better so that oh that's a good


---------19:32----------
thought to have and what I would like to


---------19:35----------
help you do today Natalia is not hold on


---------19:38----------
until things get better but let's try to


---------19:41----------
think about how we can make them better


---------19:44----------
okay right so there are going to be


---------19:46----------
fluctuations over time which is


---------19:48----------
completely normal but if you're getting


---------19:50----------
a lot of hate from the internet how can


---------19:53----------
we think about what's that what that's


---------19:55----------
doing to your mind how can we think


---------19:57----------
about you know meanness and and how to


---------19:59----------
deal with hatred and stress what do you


---------20:02----------
think about that is that a useful use


---------20:04----------
like what do you want to talk about


---------20:05----------
today yeah like generally and and and


---------20:07----------
you you mentioned like how have I been


---------20:10----------
able how have I been able to


---------20:13----------
first so long with this and I'll explain


---------20:15----------
to you how I was able to cope with it


---------20:17----------
for so long


---------20:18----------
sure number one and I think this is the


---------20:22----------
the main way that I was able to cope


---------20:24----------
with things was to tell myself that the


---------20:26----------
person the people were hating on was not


---------20:28----------
me but the idea of who they thought I


---------20:30----------
was sure so I was able to like separate


---------20:33----------
myself from the hate in a way in which


---------20:36----------
they're not hating me but this idea who


---------20:39----------
they think I am which it's not who I am


---------20:42----------
because of these people knew me I assure


---------20:44----------
you a hard person they wouldn't hate me


---------20:45----------
or they wouldn't hate me as much I mean


---------20:49----------
there's a possibility that they would


---------20:50----------
dislike me but not to the point where


---------20:52----------
like being obsessed with me and like


---------20:54----------
messaging me every single [ __ ] day


---------20:56----------
non-stop like I just these people have


---------20:59----------
to be sick like you have to be sick in


---------21:02----------
order to get pleasure of telling a


---------21:03----------
person to kill themselves every day you


---------21:05----------
know what I mean yeah how do you


---------21:07----------
understand why they hate you so much


---------21:10----------
they're just angry angry at who


---------21:15----------
at themselves


---------21:17----------
what are they angry at themselves about


---------21:21----------
oh I feel like they must have a lot of


---------21:24----------
like for you too there's a saying that


---------21:27----------
says hurt people hurt and I kind of put


---------21:30----------
them in that category


---------21:31----------
because I have things I just like you


---------21:34----------
know but I don't go out of my way to


---------21:35----------
focus my entire life on the things that


---------21:38----------
I dislike it must mean that they don't


---------21:40----------
have a lot of happy things in their life


---------21:42----------
but they can focus on so the only thing


---------21:45----------
they can do is focus on this idea of


---------21:48----------
belonging to an entire cult of the


---------21:51----------
internet that likes to hate on me you


---------21:53----------
have to understand I became the punching


---------21:55----------
bag of the internet like dr. disrespect


---------21:58----------
got banned okay I've never met the guy


---------22:01----------
never talked to him like ever had an


---------22:03----------
interaction with the guy he got banned


---------22:05----------
and I was trending on Twitter with his


---------22:07----------
band people telling me that it was my


---------22:09----------
fault that he got banned hey isn't he


---------22:12----------
make any sense you know hey I just it


---------22:16----------
doesn't make sense


---------22:17----------
like people were harassing me like why


---------22:19----------
do you get him banned like what do you


---------22:20----------
do what do you did a dog like that you


---------22:23----------
cheated with him did you like I'm like


---------22:24----------
dude like look what the [ __ ] right and


---------22:28----------
so I became obsessed on trying to find


---------22:30----------
out why he got banned cuz I wanted to


---------22:32----------
prove these people that like add nothing


---------22:34----------
to do with me hmm


---------22:37----------
and it's just like it's it's impossible


---------22:40----------
to make them happy yeah I know and so


---------22:43----------
that's why I'm trying to think about you


---------22:44----------
know how do we what do we do about that


---------22:46----------
how do you approach someone who's


---------22:48----------
impossible once when it's impossible to


---------22:51----------
make someone happy how do you deal with


---------22:52----------
that kind of person


---------22:56----------
what you can that's thrown unhappiness I


---------22:59----------
just have to ignore it well yeah so but


---------23:03----------
then then I've tried I've tried like


---------23:05----------
there's I remember this one guy a little


---------23:07----------
bit ago who was like really really


---------23:10----------
really really angry like just I could


---------23:12----------
just tell they were messaging me on


---------23:13----------
Twitter and they're like kill yourself


---------23:14----------
kill yourself [ __ ] [ __ ] [ __ ] and I


---------23:16----------
was like hey like how are you like I was


---------23:18----------
actually worried about him I was like


---------23:20----------
how are you like do you have parents


---------23:22----------
like do you have family and they're like


---------23:24----------
no [ __ ] you [ __ ] you [ __ ] kill yourself


---------23:26----------
kill yourself and I was like I was


---------23:28----------
actually I tried talking to the person I


---------23:30----------
was like hey like if you need anything


---------23:31----------
you know just like because I was feeling


---------23:33----------
good at the time like normally if I'm


---------23:35----------
feeling good like I'm strong and I can


---------23:37----------
handle it um and and I just feel like


---------23:40----------
that person must have been hurting so


---------23:42----------
much right and like my whole night I was


---------23:45----------
just like worried about this person


---------23:46----------
who's like hating on me and then I


---------23:48----------
thought I was like I'm so like why do I


---------23:50----------
care about this random guy was telling


---------23:52----------
me to kill myself like I am worried


---------23:54----------
about how they're feeling and their life


---------23:57----------
when they're being so horrible to me and


---------23:59----------
like that's not fair to me like I don't


---------24:02----------
know what to do about it yeah honestly


---------24:04----------
in Italian I'm not sure what to do about


---------24:06----------
it either I mean my thought is that can


---------24:11----------
I think for a second


---------24:23----------
hmm


---------24:29----------
so here's what I'm confused about so


---------24:33----------
often times people come on on stream and


---------24:36----------
we kind of talk about what they're


---------24:37----------
struggling with and I can understand


---------24:39----------
that you're struggling with this stuff


---------24:40----------
but the weird thing about this is like I


---------24:43----------
don't know that there is some way to


---------24:46----------
help you get to peace with this because


---------24:50----------
it's sort of like there's this


---------24:51----------
assumption that you can do something


---------24:53----------
differently and then you'll be happier


---------24:55----------
or more okay but like this sounds to me


---------24:59----------
like a little bit like cancer like your


---------25:00----------
attitude towards cancer only matters so


---------25:02----------
much right because like it I mean I I


---------25:06----------
just don't understand how a human mind


---------25:09----------
can withstand this amount of constant


---------25:13----------
hatred over this amount of time like


---------25:15----------
there's just there's some things that


---------25:17----------
are just you're just not gonna be able


---------25:18----------
to like it's just you that's not how


---------25:21----------
humans work like there's like I mean I


---------25:24----------
think that you can feel better but I


---------25:26----------
think we have to acknowledge for a


---------25:27----------
moment that you know that that that is


---------25:32----------
beyond my control yeah absolutely right


---------25:35----------
and and so I think that there's a lot of


---------25:37----------
solace and there's like I mean I don't


---------25:39----------
think you have to continue feeling the


---------25:40----------
way that you do now because I think


---------25:42----------
there are some things that you can do


---------25:44----------
differently and some things that you can


---------25:45----------
think about and understand but at the


---------25:47----------
end of the day I guess the first thing


---------25:48----------
that I want to acknowledge is that this


---------25:49----------
is not like a single-player game right


---------25:52----------
it's like and and no I mean I'm just


---------25:56----------
hearing that there's just a lot of


---------25:57----------
hatred coming from the other side and


---------25:59----------
like that hatred needs to be addressed


---------26:01----------
in order for you to feel in peace


---------26:03----------
because I don't know I don't know how I


---------26:07----------
have no idea how you deal with that like


---------26:11----------
I just don't think that like unless you


---------26:13----------
become enlightened and and become less


---------26:19----------
they become like some sort of superhuman


---------26:20----------
where where you're like whooping and


---------26:22----------
things don't affect you and and stuff


---------26:24----------
like that we can not only talk about you


---------26:26----------
know how to take one step forward in


---------26:27----------
that way I've tried like I honestly like


---------26:30----------
I've been do you know who Alan Watts


---------26:33----------
says yeah yeah I've been listening to


---------26:35----------
him like every day I've been like like


---------26:39----------
but because I've because I've been


---------26:42----------
dealing with


---------26:42----------
for two years now right like I've tried


---------26:44----------
everything I can do and like I've tried


---------26:46----------
shielding myself from it and the best I


---------26:48----------
can but it's just like it becomes


---------26:50----------
impossible like if I want to do my job I


---------26:52----------
have to see these head messages yeah so


---------26:55----------
I mean there's a part of me that says


---------26:57----------
that like the the real way for me to


---------26:59----------
help you is is not necessarily by


---------27:01----------
talking or not it's not gonna be enough


---------27:03----------
to talk to you I think what I really


---------27:05----------
have to do is try to understand the


---------27:07----------
people who say these kinds of things do


---------27:09----------
you write it's like trying to understand


---------27:12----------
and I'm with you that that there's just


---------27:14----------
angry at things I've done in the past


---------27:16----------
you know what do you want to talk about


---------27:18----------
that like I don't understand I mean yeah


---------27:20----------
okay


---------27:20----------
I can I can explain to you I can't


---------27:23----------
explain to you everything that happened


---------27:24----------
okay so this all started you have time


---------27:27----------
because it's gonna be long go for it


---------27:30----------
okay this all started with PewDiePie


---------27:33----------
okay


---------27:34----------
he's a big streamer a big youtuber the


---------27:37----------
biggest youtuber in the world I think I


---------27:41----------
was live on stream and one of my viewers


---------27:43----------
showed me his video at the time I was I


---------27:48----------
had just come from a trip and we


---------27:50----------
generally when I travel I become a


---------27:52----------
little hypomanic just change and stuff


---------27:54----------
um and they showed me a video where he


---------27:57----------
was doing an eye tracker challenge where


---------27:59----------
he was looking at some girls on Twitch


---------28:01----------
like get up and sit and stuff trying the


---------28:03----------
whole point of the eye tracker


---------28:05----------
challenges that you don't look at their


---------28:07----------
boobs and their butts and stuff like


---------28:08----------
that and he failed and so he goes all


---------28:11----------
these stupid twitch thoughts hmm you


---------28:14----------
know which I don't have you've heard the


---------28:16----------
term thought I don't think a [ __ ] it's


---------28:19----------
like a [ __ ]


---------28:20----------
oh my god yeah like just like a hoe it's


---------28:23----------
like that hoe over there or something


---------28:24----------
like that okay um hmm and I got pretty


---------28:27----------
mad um and I had just started working


---------28:30----------
with this company that was doing like


---------28:33----------
claims on videos the word like


---------28:35----------
compilations of myself I didn't think


---------28:38----------
about it I got up and he scripts my


---------28:39----------
roommate like oh can we copy strike


---------28:41----------
pewdiepie whatever hmm


---------28:43----------
nothing it was just like show me strike


---------28:46----------
like like put a copyright strike on his


---------28:48----------
video because he was yeah it was just


---------28:53----------
like a joke well I was trying to play it


---------28:54----------
up for the stream or whatever


---------28:56----------
you know like like being like oh let's


---------28:58----------
copyright strike this video but what


---------29:02----------
people don't understand is that I didn't


---------29:04----------
actually copy strike this video like I


---------29:08----------
didn't do it it was the company that was


---------29:11----------
working for me accidentally and


---------29:13----------
coincidentally put a strike on the video


---------29:16----------
now this was this huge drama on


---------29:19----------
copyright law the company that I was


---------29:21----------
working with that I stopped working with


---------29:24----------
they issued a statement saying like hey


---------29:26----------
illinit II wasn't the person that did


---------29:29----------
this it was an employee of ours they had


---------29:31----------
no reason to do this liked to put this


---------29:34----------
thing out there but nobody paid


---------29:36----------
attention to that everybody was like


---------29:38----------
she's evil she's abusing law bla bla bla


---------29:41----------
bla bla bla bla bla even though the


---------29:42----------
proof was there like this company issued


---------29:44----------
a statement they said like Alan II


---------29:46----------
didn't do this but he had so many fans


---------29:48----------
and they got so angry you know


---------29:50----------
interesting and so people because he had


---------29:54----------
so many fans and I was like a pretty


---------29:56----------
small straight guy I had like a thousand


---------29:58----------
concurrent viewers like I wasn't like


---------29:59----------
huge or anything but like I you know I


---------30:02----------
was like a decent-sized streamer um


---------30:04----------
anyway so after that people started


---------30:06----------
going back on a lot of my old videos


---------30:09----------
because I have eight years of footage


---------30:11----------
and I had all my vods from like 2015 and


---------30:15----------
2016 up and they went through all my


---------30:17----------
videos and trying to find instances in


---------30:20----------
which I had done things and I used to


---------30:22----------
have a lot of fun on the stream I just


---------30:24----------
drank all the time and like played


---------30:27----------
stands and like have a lot of fun and


---------30:29----------
then there's a clip of me and my best


---------30:33----------
friend we were drinking and somebody


---------30:37----------
asks me this is like the second the


---------30:39----------
second part of everything somebody asked


---------30:42----------
me how I got to Canada now


---------30:45----------
I I have to put a parentheses here to


---------30:48----------
explain to you something to explain this


---------30:50----------
part but I met my ex-husband in world


---------30:53----------
Warcraft back in 2009 he came and


---------30:58----------
visited I think MIT 2008 he came and


---------31:00----------
visited me for a year back and forth we


---------31:02----------
were like super in love we ended up


---------31:04----------
getting married in Colombia because he


---------31:06----------
wanted to stay there he wanted to teach


---------31:08----------
in Colombia but he wasn't able to get a


---------31:11----------
job so I had to come back to Canada


---------31:13----------
because he was broke I lived with my


---------31:15----------
parents and stuff so we started like a


---------31:17----------
sponsorship and the sponsorship took a


---------31:19----------
whole year and he visited sometimes but


---------31:21----------
sometimes not so then after a year that


---------31:25----------
I end up coming Canada it would have


---------31:26----------
been married for like a year and a half


---------31:28----------
two years already


---------31:29----------
I found out that he had been cheating on


---------31:32----------
me like the whole time


---------31:35----------
um and obviously it was really hard for


---------31:37----------
me because I had left like my entire


---------31:39----------
family in Colombia and everything to be


---------31:42----------
with this guy so I was very better I


---------31:44----------
separated from him I was already in


---------31:46----------
school so I stayed here in Canada acts


---------31:48----------
like I was going to school um but I I


---------31:53----------
have kept a lot of bitterness in my


---------31:56----------
heart for this and I understand that


---------31:58----------
that was my mistake


---------31:59----------
about being angry at him because I said


---------32:03----------
on stream when the person asked me like


---------32:05----------
how did I get to Canada I said like


---------32:07----------
laughingly I was like oh well I got


---------32:09----------
married and I came to Canada and then I


---------32:12----------
divorced him and so this whole rumor of


---------32:17----------
me committing immigration fraud got


---------32:20----------
started and


---------32:25----------
then it was like oh you know a linen


---------32:29----------
decommitted immigration fraud and then


---------32:31----------
like after enough people say it and


---------32:33----------
enough youtubers make videos of these


---------32:35----------
things it becomes my reality you know


---------32:38----------
what I mean


---------32:38----------
like people take it as a fact that that


---------32:41----------
is what happened and now I am very angry


---------32:43----------
myself because I feel like if I hadn't


---------32:46----------
been better at him back then I wouldn't


---------32:49----------
have said those things


---------32:52----------
so I put it is my fault for being angry


---------32:57----------
you know to tell you I'm not sure I


---------32:59----------
agree with that and I understand why you


---------33:03----------
would think that but like I mean the


---------33:05----------
story is you tell it today sounds like


---------33:07----------
you sort of so it sounds like you have


---------33:09----------
sort of a tendency to make off-color


---------33:10----------
jokes and then for some reason and I


---------33:14----------
mean that's that's fine yeah but but


---------33:18----------
people will always misinterpret the


---------33:21----------
things you say and will create this idea


---------33:24----------
that you're some horrible person let me


---------33:26----------
finish the whole story okay okay so


---------33:29----------
after that it was like okay I committed


---------33:33----------
copyright fraud then I committed


---------33:36----------
marriage fraud then after that I there's


---------33:41----------
there's an incident with another


---------33:43----------
streamer that I'm not gonna mention


---------33:44----------
about and there was something else I


---------33:47----------
really don't want to talk about that one


---------33:49----------
um then it was it was the the cat thing


---------33:53----------
and this one was a really bad one so my


---------33:55----------
cat stands here I don't know if you've


---------33:57----------
seen clips of it my cat likes to sit


---------33:59----------
like up here um and I was I was playing


---------34:04----------
ranked in a game and my cat jumps on my


---------34:06----------
desk and I go like oh and I try to put


---------34:09----------
him up here but he falls um and so


---------34:13----------
that's when the whole animal abuse thing


---------34:15----------
started now people started taking videos


---------34:18----------
of every single time I had interact with


---------34:20----------
my pets in eight years hmm


---------34:23----------
and then they found a clip where I was


---------34:25----------
drinking vodka and I took a sip of vodka


---------34:28----------
and then my cat licked my lips cuz


---------34:32----------
I used to do this really gross thing


---------34:34----------
where I would bird feed my cat which is


---------34:36----------
disgusting I know that means you feed


---------34:40----------
your cat food from your mouth yeah I


---------34:43----------
don't anymore but I used to do that okay


---------34:46----------
we all have younger years where we do


---------34:49----------
things that weren't exactly the smartest


---------34:51----------
yeah anyway so I'm drinking vodka and


---------34:54----------
she was able to lick some of my lips and


---------34:57----------
she was clearly distraught and I never


---------35:00----------
did that again ever again


---------35:02----------
cuz I was like oh my god I was so dumb


---------35:04----------
but I was really drunk so I know it's


---------35:06----------
not an excuse so then the animal abuse


---------35:08----------
thing got started hmm


---------35:10----------
I invited the SPCA to my house they came


---------35:13----------
here you know they they issued a


---------35:18----------
statement as well saying like hey no


---------35:21----------
abuse was found blah blah blah but now


---------35:23----------
I'm the person that committed copyright


---------35:27----------
law immigration fraud animal abuse and I


---------35:31----------
got away with everything and you know


---------35:32----------
how I got away with everything by


---------35:35----------
sleeping with people


---------35:37----------
and so this is illinit e to the intron


---------35:43----------
so a little bit where the hatred comes


---------35:46----------
from now yeah so let me ask and I blame


---------35:49----------
myself it's all my fault yeah so I know


---------35:53----------
that you're gonna start thinking that


---------35:55----------
way right because that's what happens


---------35:56----------
when we when we get treated poorly by


---------36:00----------
other people we start to believe that


---------36:02----------
about ourselves like when kids get


---------36:04----------
abused


---------36:05----------
so it's up okay so when kids get abused


---------36:08----------
they start to believe things that their


---------36:10----------
abusers tell them and that's not just


---------36:12----------
true of kids it's also true of like


---------36:14----------
abusive relationships and and then we


---------36:17----------
start to believe those things that other


---------36:19----------
people tell us because we hear them over


---------36:20----------
and over and over again and what I'm


---------36:22----------
hearing from you is that there's you


---------36:23----------
know there's like a little person inside


---------36:25----------
you who's trying to tell you not to


---------36:27----------
believe this stuff but if you hear it


---------36:28----------
often enough you start to blame yourself


---------36:31----------
is if this is partly my fault I mean


---------36:35----------
there are stupid things I should yeah


---------36:37----------
yeah they are my fault yeah so that's


---------36:39----------
that's what makes me think that you're


---------36:41----------
reasonable because I think you recognize


---------36:42----------
that you did some things that were


---------36:44----------
either off-color or you know not really


---------36:46----------
great on camera or were flat-out wrong


---------36:49----------
yeah but like the whole bad thing was so


---------36:53----------
wrong I mean the marriage thing it was


---------36:56----------
wrong that I said it in the way I said


---------36:57----------
it but I don't think that people should


---------36:59----------
have taken a clip of five seconds of me


---------37:02----------
saying that you know and like turn it


---------37:06----------
into this what it is because now every


---------37:08----------
time I travel it's a huge deal like I


---------37:10----------
can't every time I come back in the


---------37:12----------
country I have to go through like


---------37:13----------
immigration for like two hours to like


---------37:16----------
talk to someone and explain to them and


---------37:19----------
you know and like I'm always able to


---------37:23----------
come in because they always do the


---------37:24----------
research and I show them pictures and


---------37:26----------
the documents and everything and they're


---------37:27----------
like okay you guys live together you


---------37:30----------
know it's okay um we actually separated


---------37:34----------
I'm a couple II he I didn't get a penny


---------37:37----------
from the guys and want anything to do


---------37:39----------
with him you know but it's like


---------37:42----------
people just want to think that I'm this


---------37:44----------
horrible person yeah so where does the


---------37:47----------
the you slept your way out of all these


---------37:49----------
problems come from well cuz people can't


---------37:55----------
imagine that I'm not in jail like if you


---------37:56----------
hear all these things you're like this


---------37:59----------
person should be deported and they


---------38:01----------
should be like out of twitch and they


---------38:03----------
should be like in jail or something and


---------38:06----------
they see me streaming like oh happy and


---------38:08----------
having fun and people get angry at that


---------38:12----------
they don't understand that the idea that


---------38:14----------
like yes I have done things that are


---------38:16----------
wrong but half of the things that


---------38:18----------
they've heard about me are alive


---------38:21----------
you


---------38:25----------
hmm do you think you get treated


---------38:28----------
differently because of your physical


---------38:29----------
appearance oh yeah for sure


---------38:33----------
and because I'm a woman like there have


---------38:37----------
been streamers that have like fed their


---------38:39----------
cats chocolate on stream you know and


---------38:43----------
right for a cat yeah terrible for an


---------38:47----------
animal it's just this poisonous alcohol


---------38:49----------
is um and it's like people don't don't


---------38:55----------
think about it twice you know I mean hmm


---------38:59----------
why do you think they think about it


---------39:01----------
twice with you because of the narrative


---------39:02----------
because of your appearance


---------39:03----------
yeah because because I think it's the


---------39:05----------
whole PewDiePie thing that got it


---------39:07----------
started like PewDiePie fans and you know


---------39:09----------
what the what the worst part of it is


---------39:11----------
the PewDiePie and I are good now like


---------39:14----------
like I'm good with him and his fans


---------39:18----------
still think that like you know this is


---------39:20----------
very funny this happened to me with soda


---------39:22----------
- soda and I used to do arenas back in


---------39:24----------
the day you know soda soda popping okay


---------39:27----------
me and so what I used to do a long time


---------39:29----------
ago and there is this ongoing joke in


---------39:33----------
which I was supposed to give him feed


---------39:34----------
pigs for carry me and arenas which just


---------39:36----------
it was just a joke we had and then in


---------39:39----------
one of his videos he uploaded it online


---------39:41----------
and there was a comment of that and I


---------39:44----------
had people come into my stream for like


---------39:46----------
three years happy but like pictures of


---------39:49----------
my feet Oh feet pigs yes and people came


---------39:53----------
into my stream every single day for like


---------39:56----------
three years asking me to give sort of


---------39:58----------
the feed pics that he deserved so the


---------40:01----------
thing is because these videos are out


---------40:02----------
there live


---------40:03----------
sorry about the burp because those


---------40:05----------
videos are out of this person because


---------40:09----------
these videos are out there then people


---------40:12----------
think that like that is the reality


---------40:14----------
today you know what I mean like if a


---------40:16----------
person sees a video that's five years


---------40:18----------
old today they're like oh yeah this is


---------40:20----------
the reality right now but it's not so


---------40:23----------
it's just it sucks I tell you what are


---------40:27----------
you doing right now how are you feeling


---------40:29----------
I'm feeling better yes you're smiling


---------40:32----------
why yeah cuz it's funny it's a stupid


---------40:37----------
sad and funny it gets


---------40:39----------
ridiculous what's ridiculous about like


---------40:44----------
I can't believe that I'm in this


---------40:48----------
situation because the situation is so


---------40:50----------
stupid and I can't believe that I get


---------40:52----------
the amount of hate I get for something


---------40:54----------
so silly yeah I think it is it is a


---------40:59----------
funny story I mean this is what the


---------41:01----------
Internet is about right


---------41:02----------
it's about feet pick memes and and you


---------41:07----------
know collaborations and and people like


---------41:10----------
I mean that's what hopefully life is


---------41:11----------
right it's like yeah but like back then


---------41:14----------
the feedback thing was funny and then


---------41:16----------
the pewdiepie thing I actually didn't


---------41:17----------
mind it as much but then now it's just


---------41:20----------
like you're an abuser and you break the


---------41:22----------
law and this and you get away with so


---------41:25----------
much [ __ ] and it's like I don't have


---------41:28----------
control over these things like I invited


---------41:30----------
the SPCA I have to deal with immigration


---------41:32----------
every time I travel you know the


---------41:35----------
authorities have been here I have been


---------41:37----------
cleared the whole the whole copyright


---------41:40----------
thing got cleared as well and it's just


---------41:43----------
like people don't see that because they


---------41:44----------
see these videos that people who are


---------41:46----------
horrible have made online about me like


---------41:49----------
exaggerating the truth and then there's


---------41:51----------
people like keemstar who like invent


---------41:53----------
[ __ ] all the time


---------41:55----------
he like he's like created Photoshop


---------41:59----------
stuff like there's this on this ongoing


---------42:01----------
thing that I sleep with people at twitch


---------42:04----------
now that's the only way possibly in


---------42:07----------
their mind that I'm my band and it's


---------42:09----------
like I don't even leave my house


---------42:13----------
you know what I mean like I live didn't


---------42:15----------
know where Saskatchewan is no I just


---------42:17----------
know it's far away okay I live in the


---------42:21----------
Midwest of Canada I don't go - I've


---------42:23----------
never been to twitchcon I rarely ever


---------42:26----------
travel like I've gone to packs twice and


---------42:29----------
like I'm going to Blizzcon twice that's


---------42:30----------
like all the conventions have been - in


---------42:33----------
eight years and like the like I sleep


---------42:36----------
around so much and [ __ ] we're like I I


---------42:38----------
barely even leave my house you know so


---------42:42----------
it's just it's just so ridiculous it's


---------42:45----------
just like it's all so ridiculous


---------42:47----------
yes so to tell you I'm kind of confused


---------42:49----------
because it sounds like I don't know how


---------42:52----------
to help you right now you can help me I


---------42:55----------
think the only thing I can do it like I


---------42:57----------
have like two options I kill myself or I


---------43:00----------
leave the internet or like I learned how


---------43:02----------
to deal with it I guess


---------43:04----------
yeah so let's pick number three number


---------43:10----------
one sounds like a not a good idea number


---------43:13----------
two also sounds like that's not a good


---------43:16----------
idea so number three and I and I'm


---------43:20----------
dealing with it but I think I hit a


---------43:23----------
point where like I don't want to have to


---------43:24----------
deal with it anymore


---------43:26----------
yeah too much work yes it sounds like


---------43:29----------
there are things that other people have


---------43:31----------
in their lives that they can take for


---------43:33----------
granted like when I open up the internet


---------43:38----------
it is not hateful things about me and I


---------43:42----------
can only imagine what it's like to I


---------43:44----------
mean actually I can't imagine what it's


---------43:46----------
like to wake up and have you know so


---------43:50----------
much hatred about you coming from so


---------43:51----------
many like literally having to wake up


---------43:53----------
every single day and the first thing you


---------43:55----------
do in the morning is clear hey Instagram


---------43:57----------
comments like that is my morning every


---------44:01----------
single day that's a sentence then I do


---------44:09----------
it I've been doing it for two years


---------44:10----------
though


---------44:13----------
yeah I think that that helping you deal


---------44:16----------
with it is like a piece of it but I


---------44:18----------
think we've gotta understand I mean I'm


---------44:19----------
looking at this a little bit more and


---------44:21----------
the apologies that this is unfair to you


---------44:23----------
Natalia but I just don't think that you


---------44:25----------
can you know people are abusing you


---------44:30----------
which it sounds like actually what your


---------44:31----------
what the sounds to me like is that


---------44:33----------
you're an abusive relationship with the


---------44:35----------
Internet and oftentimes we see a lot of


---------44:39----------
trouble amiss like I deserve it though


---------44:41----------
but you deserve what I got I mean I


---------44:47----------
don't to you they're all the hate I get


---------44:49----------
but I I deserved that they hate at some


---------44:51----------
point it's just like it's perpetuated


---------44:54----------
you know right but I think I've already


---------44:57----------
paid my dues like I've suffered enough


---------44:58----------
you know what it means


---------45:00----------
yeah so that's that's what I think that


---------45:02----------
you know if you deserve I think if you


---------45:03----------
did something wrong sure you deserve I


---------45:05----------
don't know if you deserve Hey I mean I


---------45:07----------
think that I wouldn't I don't know that


---------45:10----------
people deserve hey I think what they


---------45:12----------
deserve is you know possibly punishment


---------45:15----------
or justice yeah what total things that I


---------45:18----------
didn't get the judgment that and they


---------45:20----------
believed I deserved so they're giving me


---------45:23----------
my punishment and hey yeah what I'm


---------45:24----------
trying to figure out is why do they care


---------45:26----------
so much about you I mean there are lots


---------45:28----------
of people out there that can be hated


---------45:30----------
and a lot of streamers get hate from a


---------45:32----------
lot of people it seems like you're lucky


---------45:35----------
or unlucky enough to get a particularly


---------45:37----------
passionate and committed group of people


---------45:40----------
or the or what's happening is there


---------45:44----------
could be a cognitive bias going on I


---------45:46----------
mean I'm not really getting this but the


---------45:47----------
other option is that you are [ __ ] up


---------45:49----------
on way more regular basis and more


---------45:52----------
severely than you think now is that an


---------45:55----------
option like are you because I don't


---------45:56----------
think that that's the case but generally


---------45:58----------
no that's not the case I mean I had like


---------46:01----------
an accidentally accidental nip slip like


---------46:03----------
three months ago but other than that the


---------46:06----------
cat thing was like it the cat thing was


---------46:08----------
oh and it was so horrible dude they like


---------46:13----------
made so many NIT so many memes about it


---------46:15----------
and like they body shamed me so much


---------46:17----------
telling me that my nipples were like too


---------46:19----------
dark and they were like people made fun


---------46:22----------
of my nipple


---------46:26----------
and it wasn't and hey it wasn't just


---------46:29----------
viewers the thing is it's also streamers


---------46:31----------
that do this all the time and so when


---------46:34----------
streamers talk about me and say [ __ ]


---------46:36----------
about me then their viewers come and


---------46:39----------
hate on me and so I just like got


---------46:40----------
constant waves of people coming into my


---------46:44----------
stream because I'll like show a clip for


---------46:46----------
like like sometimes on Instagram and


---------46:48----------
they'll be like a story of something I


---------46:49----------
said like three years ago and then


---------46:52----------
they'll be like my Instagram gets


---------46:53----------
flooded with people saying hateful stuff


---------46:56----------
how many people are there do you think


---------46:59----------
that that sort of do this is it like is


---------47:01----------
it a lot or is it like a few very


---------47:03----------
dedicated people there's big streamers


---------47:06----------
that do this like big drama channels


---------47:09----------
love talking about me because I think


---------47:10----------
like I became a meme and and so many


---------47:14----------
people hated me so much that I became


---------47:16----------
like a really easy way of getting views


---------47:18----------
and followers and likes I'm sorry what


---------47:22----------
does that mean are you feeling because


---------47:25----------
it's dumb so what are you feeling when


---------47:27----------
you start to smile I I just I just like


---------47:30----------
laugh about things that make me sad


---------47:35----------
are you sad about this of course I just


---------47:38----------
don't think it's fair okay let people


---------47:40----------
get to use me and the bad things that


---------47:43----------
have happened to me for their own


---------47:45----------
monetary benefit I think it's dumb


---------47:49----------
yeah I've come to understand that there


---------47:52----------
are a couple of channels that basically


---------47:54----------
are like drama farming and yeah he talks


---------47:59----------
about me like every day though like what


---------48:01----------
even if I don't do anything he like he


---------48:05----------
likes to like go like oh I know I'll in


---------48:07----------
any I know what a linen he has on Twitch


---------48:08----------
blah blah blah like I don't have


---------48:10----------
anything on Twitch what is who's


---------48:12----------
keemstar Oh freaking sociopath he's like


---------48:19----------
he's like he's done so many horrible


---------48:22----------
things I don't even know where to start


---------48:23----------
you should go watch the the hair


---------48:25----------
productions he made a video on him I


---------48:27----------
don't even want to talk about it he's


---------48:29----------
just not a nice person and I'm pretty


---------48:32----------
sure everybody can agree with that well


---------48:34----------
he has followers but he's known for like


---------48:36----------
making up [ __ ] and like going after


---------48:39----------
people and like


---------48:42----------
affect them them a lot and I


---------48:45----------
yeah just not nice yeah Natalia I'm


---------48:50----------
sorry to say but like everything you're


---------48:52----------
telling me makes me think that this is


---------48:53----------
not like this problem is bigger than you


---------48:55----------
I mean there's there's a lot here in


---------48:58----------
terms of like grief and difficulty and


---------49:00----------
stress and [ __ ] like that but I don't


---------49:03----------
know like sometimes when I talk to


---------49:05----------
people there their perceptions are


---------49:06----------
distorted and so I think that part of


---------49:09----------
what I do is like help them understand


---------49:11----------
how does your mind work okay what what


---------49:12----------
is stress doing to you things like that


---------49:14----------
but in a weird way I'm not I'm not


---------49:16----------
hearing a whole lot like I don't know


---------49:18----------
exactly how to help you like do you have


---------49:20----------
any sense of what I can do to help you


---------49:25----------
what can I do that would be helpful


---------49:33----------
I don't know


---------49:35----------
do you think you can you're a


---------49:37----------
professional you tell me yep I am the


---------49:40----------
professional hmm do you think life you


---------49:43----------
know if you don't think I can be helped


---------49:45----------
that's not what I said I'm asking you do


---------49:47----------
you think here's the thing I honestly


---------49:50----------
think that everything that I could have


---------49:52----------
done I've already done it yeah I can I


---------49:56----------
really do yeah I can tell that you would


---------49:58----------
think that way so my next question for


---------50:00----------
you is do you think you can be helped do


---------50:01----------
you think you can feel better do you


---------50:03----------
think you can be better


---------50:10----------
I don't know


---------50:13----------
it's just it's just a big problem like


---------50:16----------
it's not you're right it's not just me


---------50:18----------
it's like it's like an issue of like


---------50:21----------
social media and the world and stuff


---------50:24----------
yeah and and so maybe that's why I'm


---------50:28----------
having some difficulty because like I


---------50:30----------
think we have to start with your


---------50:32----------
perception of whether you have to


---------50:35----------
continue to feel this way right because


---------50:38----------
like changing the way that you feel is


---------50:41----------
actually stuff too step one is can you


---------50:45----------
change


---------50:50----------
do you have to wake up and feel the way


---------50:53----------
that you do every morning no it's not


---------50:57----------
worth it anymore


---------50:59----------
okay so what about your what do you


---------51:04----------
think can change about the way that your


---------51:07----------
mind is or the way that your life is


---------51:11----------
like the situation that I'm put in is


---------51:14----------
the only thing line used to change


---------51:17----------
so I'm not so sure I agree like I like


---------51:21----------
either like not being on the internet


---------51:24----------
anymore you know and like that's a


---------51:27----------
possibility for me like I can just go


---------51:29----------
back to school or something sure yeah


---------51:33----------
yeah so generally I do feel like this is


---------51:35----------
gonna follow me everywhere like I live


---------51:37----------
in a small city and literally like


---------51:39----------
everybody knows about me okay funny


---------51:43----------
thing I was actually I was actually in


---------51:45----------
um in nursing school when I started


---------51:48----------
streaming the first two years of


---------51:49----------
streaming and um I actually had a viewer


---------51:52----------
report me to the CRNA the registered


---------51:55----------
nurses association in Saskatchewan


---------51:57----------
they sent a bunch of [ __ ] about me that


---------52:00----------
I was like getting naked on stream and


---------52:02----------
saying that I was paying college through


---------52:05----------
that just like stupid [ __ ] and I got


---------52:08----------
called to the dean's office and the


---------52:10----------
Zetas like super racist it was awful it


---------52:13----------
was an awful experience it was partly


---------52:14----------
the reason why I quit nursing to stream


---------52:17----------
was because of that because I so like


---------52:19----------
I'm thinking like if I go back to school


---------52:21----------
it's gonna be that - like people aren't


---------52:23----------
gonna leave me alone regardless of what


---------52:25----------
I do


---------52:26----------
like I'd have to change my name and go


---------52:28----------
somewhere else maybe like maybe that's


---------52:30----------
the only way


---------52:34----------
yeah I don't want to accept that answer


---------52:36----------
I'm not saying that you're wrong I'm


---------52:38----------
just saying that I don't want to accept


---------52:41----------
it what do you think about them I think


---------52:47----------
it would be really nice to go and start


---------52:50----------
again from zero somewhere else what


---------52:56----------
would be nice about that but I don't


---------52:59----------
have to deal with this anymore


---------53:05----------
yeah that does sound I wouldn't blame


---------53:08----------
you see decided to do that I mean I


---------53:09----------
think no one really good but I don't see


---------53:12----------
how anyone could I'm sure I I think if


---------53:15----------
we're I'm hearing one thing the Talley


---------53:17----------
it's that people blame you for all kinds


---------53:19----------
of [ __ ] that's unfair they may find a


---------53:21----------
way to blame you then I mean I wouldn't


---------53:26----------
let people know where I am or what my


---------53:28----------
new name is and they wouldn't be able to


---------53:31----------
find me she's like I have to disappear


---------53:32----------
basically do you want to do that yeah


---------53:43----------
I just want to be a different person I


---------53:45----------
don't like me anymore


---------53:50----------
that hurts to hear because I don't think


---------53:54----------
that your I don't think it's fair for


---------53:58----------
you to not like the person that at least


---------54:00----------
I'm talking to I like the person I'm


---------54:06----------
talking to I think you're a wonderful


---------54:08----------
person that's sweet thank you


---------54:13----------
why do you think I think


---------54:21----------
cuz you're a nice person and you see the


---------54:25----------
grid of people okay right so so now we


---------54:28----------
see something interesting so I think


---------54:30----------
you're a wonderful person because I'm


---------54:33----------
relentlessly positive that what you're


---------54:37----------
saying no no I'm not saying that but


---------54:39----------
okay like


---------54:42----------
if a person is not like a good person


---------54:45----------
they see the bad in others if a person


---------54:48----------
like I don't know how to explain this


---------54:50----------
okay so you see the good in people


---------54:52----------
you're seeing the good the good


---------54:54----------
qualities in me why do I see good


---------54:56----------
quality what do I see in you that's good


---------55:00----------
I don't know you tell me nope you tell


---------55:03----------
me if you really if you really have


---------55:05----------
trouble with you really okay


---------55:10----------
I really like it if you could try so I'm


---------55:14----------
just meeting you for the first time


---------55:15----------
today yeah so like what could I possibly


---------55:18----------
think is respect what you probably say


---------55:20----------
that to all your like clients and


---------55:22----------
patients you always tell them that you


---------55:24----------
like ah


---------55:24----------
so when you say when you say that I say


---------55:27----------
that to everyone what you're doing is


---------55:29----------
actually invalidating what I'm telling


---------55:31----------
you do you see that you're kind of


---------55:33----------
saying but you say that to everyone you


---------55:35----------
don't know me you don't know me how can


---------55:37----------
you like me ah that's a good question I


---------55:41----------
don't know you so what is it about you


---------55:44----------
that I don't know we would change my


---------55:50----------
mind let's give it a shot


---------55:54----------
but be careful because we don't want to


---------55:56----------
give people like more ammo so maybe if


---------55:59----------
you don't speak but oh my god right I


---------56:03----------
mean we need to be careful here for a


---------56:04----------
second but I'd say try like okay I'll


---------56:09----------
tell you what my friend say about me


---------56:10----------
they say that I'm a very generous person


---------56:14----------
okay actually Josh said that to me


---------56:17----------
yesterday that I'm very relaxed like a


---------56:20----------
very chill I'm cool with whatever like


---------56:22----------
I'm not a complicated person


---------56:27----------
I like to treat every human the same


---------56:30----------
like I hate we're in like other content


---------56:32----------
creators think like they're better than


---------56:33----------
other people like that are really


---------56:35----------
triggers me so I don't know if there's a


---------56:37----------
word for defining like I'd like to treat


---------56:40----------
everyone equally


---------56:43----------
okay no matter who they are do I know


---------56:47----------
any of that about you no you don't know


---------56:51----------
that about me so why why on earth would


---------56:53----------
I think you're a wonderful person is it


---------56:55----------
just because that's what I say to


---------56:56----------
everyone because I'm a human and all


---------56:58----------
humans are wonderful in a way I guess I


---------57:02----------
don't know tell me yeah so but so so in


---------57:05----------
telly good so now let's think about the


---------57:07----------
answers that you're coming up with or


---------57:09----------
just like general right there's nothing


---------57:10----------
specific about but I think this is the


---------57:13----------
problem is that you started when you say


---------57:15----------
you don't want to be you anymore what


---------57:17----------
I'm seeing is that you don't see


---------57:18----------
anything specifically good about you as


---------57:21----------
a person like you you can't you


---------57:24----------
literally can't come up with anything


---------57:26----------
that you've talked about today that


---------57:27----------
would make you like respect and


---------57:29----------
appreciate you as a person right it's


---------57:33----------
all general stuff it's like just because


---------57:34----------
I'm a nice guy and I see the good in all


---------57:36----------
people [ __ ] like that nah I wish that


---------57:38----------
was true but I I don't I see I see


---------57:40----------
badness and people too so here's what I


---------57:43----------
think is pretty respectable the first is


---------57:45----------
that you're trying to be different that


---------57:47----------
first and foremost has you in my corner


---------57:49----------
I'm in your corner sorry because I think


---------57:52----------
you've recognized that you've done some


---------57:54----------
things wrong and you're trying to change


---------57:56----------
so if there is one thing that will make


---------58:00----------
me think that you are a wonderful person


---------58:01----------
and makes me think that makes me respect


---------58:04----------
you and also makes me think that you


---------58:07----------
deserve my help is that you yourself for


---------58:10----------
trying to change so I don't know if if


---------58:13----------
you get this Nathalia but not everyone


---------58:16----------
is like that like you just think about


---------58:19----------
the people that send you Instagram


---------58:21----------
messages every day or like those people


---------58:24----------
do you think they wake up in the morning


---------58:26----------
and they say I'm gonna try to be a


---------58:27----------
better person what have I done wrong in


---------58:29----------
my life and how can I try to do better I


---------58:33----------
find it hard to believe that the legions


---------58:35----------
of people that are hating you wake up


---------58:37----------
every day and try to become better human


---------58:40----------
beings maybe they are maybe it's unfair


---------58:43----------
maybe we're judging them unfairly fine


---------58:45----------
right and maybe there's a bias with the


---------58:48----------
way that you're displaying information


---------58:49----------
there are all kinds of reasons that that


---------58:51----------
could be wrong but generally in my


---------58:53----------
experience when you have people who wake


---------58:56----------
up every day and they just like spout


---------58:58----------
hate and other human beings that doesn't


---------59:00----------
strike me as a very self-reflective


---------59:02----------
person maybe they're I don't know so the


---------59:05----------
first thing reason that I think you're


---------59:07----------
wonderful is because I think you're


---------59:08----------
trying to be a different person second


---------59:12----------
thing is that you know I know this is


---------59:13----------
probably gonna be I'm gonna get some


---------59:14----------
[ __ ] for this but I think you're


---------59:16----------
actually kind of funny and and I think


---------59:19----------
that you're you're also maybe I don't


---------59:22----------
know if you're and I say this with


---------59:24----------
respect okay but you know I still gotta


---------59:29----------
say I don't know if you're unlucky or


---------59:33----------
hurts vo missus oh yeah I don't know if


---------59:35----------
you're a little bit stupid because I


---------59:37----------
think that like some of the stuff that


---------59:38----------
you're doing on stream is like is like


---------59:40----------
really not that great and that sounds


---------59:44----------
kind of dumb to me but I also think a


---------59:46----------
lot of what you're describing is where


---------59:47----------
it's like I think the whole feet big


---------59:49----------
thing is is [ __ ] hilarious and I


---------59:51----------
think that you are unlucky because I


---------59:53----------
think there are people like making


---------59:55----------
people laugh I know and that's what too


---------59:57----------
extreme yeah I really I really sometimes


---------60:00----------
I think like if I make myself look


---------60:03----------
stupid and I get people to laugh like


---------60:06----------
that's what went on me like I don't mind


---------60:08----------
making a fool out of myself if I can get


---------60:11----------
somebody to have a good time yeah so I


---------60:13----------
mean I I think a lot of what you do is


---------60:15----------
like par for the course for what happens


---------60:17----------
on Twitch and actually white which is a


---------60:19----------
wonderful place because there are stupid


---------60:22----------
ass memes that get propagated and there


---------60:24----------
are actually suicidal kids out there who


---------60:25----------
can watch that laugh get their day gets


---------60:27----------
a little bit brighter and in the world


---------60:29----------
actually becomes a slightly better yeah


---------60:30----------
and I do believe that and I also think


---------60:34----------
that like III I mean I haven't really


---------60:35----------
watched your streams and I don't really


---------60:37----------
know and I'm new to twitch I've been


---------60:38----------
doing this for about six months and I


---------60:40----------
don't have time to watch my twitch any


---------60:41----------
yeah but but it does sound to me like


---------60:44----------
there are a couple of things that you've


---------60:45----------
done which which I would really


---------60:47----------
think long and hard about and at the top


---------60:49----------
of the list is like how much you consume


---------60:50----------
alcohol in general and also on stream


---------60:53----------
okay that's smart


---------60:55----------
yes sometimes but so so that's the kind


---------60:59----------
of thing like what I think when I


---------61:00----------
respect you and I think you're a


---------61:02----------
wonderful person like that's the kind of


---------61:04----------
thing that I'm talking about right


---------61:07----------
because at the end of the day I want to


---------61:09----------
have hope for you and I think you are a


---------61:11----------
good person and sure do I see the good


---------61:12----------
in people absolutely but I also see like


---------61:15----------
the bad people and and what I'm hearing


---------61:18----------
from you is that you know you make a


---------61:19----------
couple of off-color comments like I


---------61:21----------
think I mean you know personally I'm not


---------61:24----------
saying that this comment was good or


---------61:25----------
that I support it but I think sort of


---------61:28----------
like cracking an immigration joke about


---------61:29----------
your your ex-husband who cheated on you


---------61:32----------
is like within the realm of


---------61:35----------
understandable acceptable unclear but


---------61:39----------
like people make jokes all the


---------61:41----------
full-width what I say now like I used to


---------61:43----------
be like a real free-spirited person yes


---------61:45----------
I'm not I'm not afraid here's the way


---------61:49----------
that I felt before all this happened I


---------61:52----------
knew that I was good right like I knew


---------61:56----------
in my heart that I was good and I wasn't


---------61:59----------
afraid of like saying something that


---------62:02----------
would make people think I was bad


---------62:03----------
because I that people would receive me


---------62:06----------
in the way that I was expressing myself


---------62:09----------
and what I've learned is that you have


---------62:11----------
to be really careful with how you say


---------62:13----------
things because they can be


---------62:14----------
misinterpreted and I didn't know this


---------62:17----------
because it was a little girl my parents


---------62:18----------
never like told me not to do something


---------62:21----------
or not to say something they let me do


---------62:24----------
whatever I wanted to do and say whatever


---------62:26----------
I wanted to say even if it wasn't


---------62:28----------
appropriate they thought they were just


---------62:30----------
letting me be my true me so I never


---------62:32----------
really learned that as I get to like be


---------62:35----------
careful with my words yes I think that's


---------62:39----------
a very important lesson to learn and I'm


---------62:42----------
happy to hear that sense


---------62:44----------
unfortunately that you had to learn the


---------62:46----------
hard way that especially when you have a


---------62:48----------
public platform the words that you say


---------62:50----------
have a lot of meaning and I'm not saying


---------62:53----------
that the joke was appropriate what I'm


---------62:54----------
saying is that like I you know in


---------62:57----------
private I've had a lot of people who


---------62:59----------
have dealt with with very difficult


---------63:01----------
situations and painful situations and


---------63:03----------
they oftentimes the only way they can


---------63:05----------
tolerate them is to make jokes about


---------63:07----------
them and that's what I do that's what I


---------63:09----------
do like I I made like chaff throwing


---------63:12----------
jokes now all the time because like it's


---------63:14----------
the only way I can cope with it yeah you


---------63:17----------
know but like then people see it and


---------63:19----------
they're like oh my god then if she


---------63:21----------
doesn't feel sorry for what she's done


---------63:22----------
and so like it's just difficult it feels


---------63:25----------
like there's no win you know um after


---------63:29----------
this whole like animal abuse thing


---------63:30----------
happened I was doing yoga on stream I


---------63:34----------
was trying to practice a headstand and


---------63:37----------
to go in a headstand you have to go in


---------63:38----------
downward dog then - and it's a position


---------63:42----------
when you go like this basically where


---------63:44----------
your legs are here your bum is up here


---------63:46----------
and your head is out here right um and


---------63:48----------
my dog this was right after the animal


---------63:50----------
abused my dog comes behind me and starts


---------63:52----------
sniffing my ass and so I thought I can't


---------63:54----------
push her because if I push her people


---------63:56----------
are gonna be like animal abuse sorry


---------63:59----------
sorry I very slowly move down you know


---------64:03----------
and like I was like okay Luna careful


---------64:05----------
and yeah it took me a long time to like


---------64:07----------
get out of the post without like being


---------64:09----------
super careful not to touch her or hurt


---------64:11----------
her and then when people started saying


---------64:13----------
was that I [ __ ] my dog seriously they


---------64:16----------
started making memes about me [ __ ] my


---------64:18----------
dog and that I had trained my dog to


---------64:19----------
lick my vagina or whatever and it's just


---------64:22----------
like it


---------64:23----------
doesn't matter what you do yeah what


---------64:29----------
don't [ __ ] how do you get that from dogs


---------64:32----------
if asses that's what they do I'm sorry


---------64:38----------
that just sounds so preposterous to me I


---------64:44----------
I just feel like people really wanted me


---------64:47----------
to be evil you know what I mean yeah so


---------64:49----------
then let me ask you a question okay so


---------64:51----------
so maybe I'm okay so a couple bouts


---------64:55----------
one thought that I just want to toss out


---------64:57----------
and then I have a question for you so


---------64:58----------
the first is that you know are about a


---------65:00----------
week ago we had a group of female gamers


---------65:03----------
we just came on and talked about their


---------65:04----------
experiences with dealing with toxicity


---------65:07----------
in games and and one of the interesting


---------65:09----------
things that they talked about at the end


---------65:11----------
is actually expressing some amount of


---------65:13----------
curiosity about like why are why are the


---------65:16----------
dudes toxic in games like what's going


---------65:18----------
on in their head and that's got me


---------65:20----------
thinking a lot about like understanding


---------65:22----------
where the birth of hatred comes from


---------65:25----------
because like so far what we've been


---------65:27----------
focused on like is an organization is


---------65:29----------
like helping the people who are getting


---------65:32----------
hurt and like trying to help like the


---------65:35----------
victims but like I've been thinking a


---------65:37----------
lot about you know should we be focusing


---------65:41----------
on the source of the toxicity instead of


---------65:44----------
the effect of the toxicity because what


---------65:47----------
I'm hearing then and just hearing you


---------65:50----------
today and once again there could be a


---------65:52----------
like a bunch of cognitive bias or things


---------65:53----------
like that but I'm not really getting


---------65:55----------
that I mean it sounds like you you


---------65:56----------
recognize that you did a couple things


---------65:57----------
that we're sort of out of line I mean


---------65:59----------
none of it really sounds band worthy you


---------66:02----------
know to me I don't know but you know I


---------66:08----------
don't know and so I it's just got me


---------66:11----------
thinking a lot about them instead of you


---------66:13----------
but I don't know that it's gonna be


---------66:16----------
productive to have a conversation about


---------66:18----------
them so let's just talk about so I just


---------66:20----------
wanted to toss that out I love it if you


---------66:22----------
think about it for a little while and


---------66:24----------
then get back to me about about the


---------66:25----------
origin of the hatred comes from yeah


---------66:28----------
or if you have thoughts about that like


---------66:30----------
I mean because I just don't think like


---------66:32----------
it comes from someone who is is angry


---------66:36----------
yeah


---------66:38----------
so like every a feeling of like


---------66:40----------
powerlessness yeah so that's the whole


---------66:44----------
point it's like it's like maybe what we


---------66:46----------
don't understand yeah and-and-and


---------66:49----------
but here's the question that I have for


---------66:50----------
you and I think that this is kind of an


---------66:52----------
important one you said that when you


---------66:53----------
were growing up like you had a sense


---------66:55----------
that you were good as a person and I'm


---------66:58----------
curious about do you still feel that way


---------67:00----------
do you feel like on the outside Natalia


---------67:03----------
is a good person I do but I don't think


---------67:05----------
that people see that and that's what


---------67:07----------
hurts me yes I don't think that they I


---------67:09----------
think they choose not to see that yeah I


---------67:11----------
think I think it means a lot to them for


---------67:14----------
you to be somehow how is it


---------67:16----------
what is the cold odd bias we're like


---------67:18----------
when you believe something everything


---------67:19----------
that gets shown at you is just gonna


---------67:21----------
reaffirm the by yeah I think it I think


---------67:24----------
that's me event


---------67:25----------
confirmation bias yeah yeah yeah that's


---------67:28----------
the thing and like it doesn't matter


---------67:29----------
what I do at this point like people have


---------67:30----------
already made up their mind and Who I am


---------67:32----------
everything I do is just gonna confirm


---------67:34----------
what they believe yeah so I I don't know


---------67:38----------
so it sounds like you're able to still


---------67:41----------
separate their hatred and sort of


---------67:43----------
recognize that some of that is


---------67:44----------
irrational that's yeah you've been yeah


---------67:47----------
it still affects me yeah what hurts it


---------67:52----------
just frustrates me frustration is an


---------67:56----------
umbrella emotion there's another kind of


---------67:59----------
emotion blind underneath frustration


---------68:01----------
what's what are you frustrated by can I


---------68:13----------
go to the bathroom real quick


---------68:14----------
yep okay okay I'll think about it while


---------68:17----------
I'm in the bathroom


---------68:18----------
okay


---------68:25----------
all right twitch at


---------68:36----------
you


---------68:44----------
yeah this is this is uh this is


---------68:47----------
interesting


---------68:55----------
you


---------68:57----------
and I I don't know how much of this is


---------68:59----------
about her like it's weird right like I


---------69:02----------
mean I don't


---------69:07----------
I mean you know what this reminds me of


---------69:09----------
but like it reminds me of like being a


---------69:11----------
field medic I mean I've never been a


---------69:13----------
field medic and it's like if you get a


---------69:16----------
patient that's been shot a bunch of


---------69:18----------
times and then you deal with you know


---------69:21----------
you you get the bullets out and things


---------69:23----------
like that and then okay they go back out


---------69:27----------
into the field yeah


---------69:29----------
sorry to interrupt you no go for it I


---------69:32----------
have to say I have the biggest insights


---------69:34----------
in life when I'm in the bathroom I


---------69:36----------
figured it out you figured it out what


---------69:39----------
did you figure it's a control thing what


---------69:41----------
does that mean


---------69:43----------
I've always had a control problem like


---------69:45----------
my eating disorder like everything it's


---------69:47----------
about not being able to control things


---------69:48----------
in life I can't control what people


---------69:50----------
think about me oh that upsets me I can't


---------69:54----------
control people say about me that upsets


---------69:56----------
me ah now we're getting somewhere see


---------69:59----------
now I can help you with this yeah okay


---------70:08----------
so say tell us more about that I don't


---------70:13----------
know like I I've always heard that like


---------70:16----------
anorexia stems from like a lack of


---------70:18----------
control and like for me the way that


---------70:23----------
like I've always coped with stress


---------70:27----------
has been by like being able to control


---------70:30----------
things yes so like when I was younger it


---------70:33----------
was with food I would just like me like


---------70:35----------
you know the whole world can be falling


---------70:37----------
apart but if I'm only eating one apple a


---------70:39----------
day that's the only focus in my life and


---------70:42----------
everything else doesn't matter now


---------70:47----------
because I don't have that anymore


---------70:51----------
I organized so I just like take my


---------71:01----------
entire closet apart organized by color


---------71:03----------
by shape by four you know um clean my


---------71:09----------
entire home things like that I've always


---------71:14----------
had an issue with like not having


---------71:16----------
control over things and I think that


---------71:19----------
probably stems from somewhere in my


---------71:20----------
childhood where my dad was in prison or


---------71:23----------
you know probably there I feel like all


---------71:26----------
my issues started with my I grew up in


---------71:29----------
Colombia in the 90s


---------71:31----------
and there was cartels and guerrillas and


---------71:34----------
bomb bins and kidnappings and the cartel


---------71:38----------
went down my dad was related to the


---------71:40----------
cartel he ended up in prison it was like


---------71:42----------
then I parents separated it was just


---------71:46----------
like one thing after the other and right


---------71:49----------
after that I developed writing disorder


---------71:53----------
what was going on around that time um


---------71:59----------
well like I said it was like one thing


---------72:03----------
after the other yes right so so so it


---------72:05----------
sounds like your dad went to prison she


---------72:07----------
did well yeah like for you it sucked


---------72:14----------
it really did and not just because of


---------72:16----------
that but because my mom found it he was


---------72:19----------
cheating on her wash well he was in


---------72:21----------
prison so my mom suffered a lot because


---------72:24----------
of that and my dad was shot on her while


---------72:27----------
he was in prison yeah my dad's a big


---------72:31----------
cheater like I've it's five of us from


---------72:35----------
four different moms there's overlap in


---------72:37----------
relationships like why not that was a


---------72:40----------
player yeah so anyway um I had like a


---------72:45----------
tumultuous childhood I would say there


---------72:47----------
is like a lot of things that happened


---------72:50----------
that don't I don't know I wouldn't say


---------72:52----------
like more than the average person but


---------72:54----------
there's a lot of change happening


---------72:56----------
rapidly between the ages of like nine to


---------73:00----------
13


---------73:02----------
um and then writing disorder started


---------73:05----------
then when I was 16 my mom had cancer


---------73:10----------
yeah and then


---------73:15----------
I was still being bulimic at the time


---------73:17----------
and I was in I got into medical school


---------73:22----------
but then I started playing world


---------73:24----------
Warcraft and I got like I got upset no


---------73:28----------
but it was bad like I was addicted to


---------73:31----------
world Warcraft I quit school everything


---------73:33----------
I am I started just like would wake up


---------73:36----------
play Wow all day until I went to bed for


---------73:38----------
two years I didn't do anything that's


---------73:40----------
how I met my ex-husband and then I ended


---------73:43----------
up here in Canada and then I ended


---------73:45----------
streaming and it's just like my whole


---------73:46----------
life has been like a roller coaster of


---------73:48----------
things going on what did your dad think


---------73:51----------
about him


---------73:52----------
ooh my relationship with my father Freud


---------73:56----------
why would he say about this um okay my


---------74:02----------
dad wasn't really that much there like


---------74:05----------
he was there he was there like on the


---------74:07----------
weekends um we didn't have like a really


---------74:10----------
close relationship but he was always


---------74:12----------
there


---------74:15----------
you know he helped a lot he put me


---------74:18----------
through like a really good school he


---------74:20----------
paid to things so my dad paid private


---------74:23----------
health care and private school for me so


---------74:27----------
I was able to go to school with a lot of


---------74:28----------
like really rich kids even though we


---------74:31----------
weren't rich like me and my mom weren't


---------74:32----------
rich but like I went to like a really


---------74:35----------
rich school and it was hard cuz I don't


---------74:41----------
know I never felt like I fit in in


---------74:42----------
school either plus I had an eating


---------74:45----------
disorder and it was very visible that I


---------74:47----------
had an eating disorder I mean I was 23


---------74:48----------
pounds don't need three kilos sorry like


---------74:51----------
that's like I don't know like 60 pounds


---------74:53----------
less than like I was


---------74:55----------
I was Amman ceated like it was really


---------74:58----------
bad


---------74:58----------
um and so I feel like people would look


---------75:02----------
at me with like like yuck like everybody


---------75:06----------
would stare at me


---------75:08----------
and so that was pretty hard that was


---------75:10----------
like high school for me was like being


---------75:12----------
alone and people like staring at me


---------75:14----------
because I looked like I was dying yeah


---------75:22----------
did it feel to have them stare I think


---------75:27----------
that was my motivation for getting


---------75:28----------
better


---------75:30----------
is that weird


---------75:32----------
no like I just didn't want people to


---------75:35----------
look at me like that anymore you talking


---------75:38----------
about people in school or nowadays on


---------75:40----------
the Internet


---------75:41----------
oh no not in the internet I look good


---------75:44----------
now like I'm good I don't look like I I


---------75:47----------
was just thinking that it was


---------75:48----------
interesting because the statement that


---------75:49----------
you made I wonder if it could apply now


---------75:51----------
right that you just don't want people to


---------75:56----------
look at you the way that they do is that


---------76:00----------
how that feels


---------76:01----------
I just don't want people to look at me


---------76:04----------
at all like I want to go back to my


---------76:07----------
small little community of people that


---------76:09----------
hung out and play video games I like


---------76:11----------
that


---------76:13----------
I don't want Fame I don't want money I


---------76:15----------
just want to meet have enough money to


---------76:16----------
pay my bills and have fun playing video


---------76:18----------
games with my close friends that's all I


---------76:20----------
want to do like I I'm not asking people


---------76:23----------
to like me I'm just I just want them to


---------76:25----------
stop harassing me 24/7


---------76:29----------
so this sounds to me like it feels quite


---------76:31----------
different from what the way that you


---------76:33----------
felt back when you had an eating


---------76:34----------
disorder at school oh yeah totally have


---------76:41----------
you ever felt the way that you do now


---------76:43----------
like before like growing up


---------76:49----------
no not really like I I had like moments


---------76:52----------
of like bullying shortly maybe like in


---------76:56----------
like sixth grade when there's these two


---------77:00----------
kids they like start throwing things at


---------77:02----------
me


---------77:04----------
but that was easy because I could just


---------77:05----------
get away from them I can't get away from


---------77:08----------
this yeah


---------77:10----------
that don't sound what you really want to


---------77:12----------
do is just get away from it start a new


---------77:15----------
life


---------77:16----------
yes just play your games with your


---------77:20----------
friends and hang out and have a good


---------77:21----------
time yeah you know so just to be clear


---------77:31----------
you know I think we talked a lot about


---------77:33----------
the past on the stream and I think we


---------77:35----------
learned a lot of important lessons from


---------77:37----------
the past we learn about how to relate to


---------77:39----------
people and things like that but I think


---------77:43----------
Natalia your story is a really good


---------77:46----------
example of how like I'm sure the past is


---------77:48----------
significant but it sounds to me like


---------77:49----------
this isn't some kind of you know this


---------77:52----------
didn't start when you were not I mean I


---------77:54----------
think some stuff started when you were


---------77:56----------
nine yeah but I think I was able to


---------77:58----------
recover like I am my eating disorders in


---------78:01----------
check and honestly like I think I have


---------78:03----------
my my polaron check I haven't done any


---------78:05----------
crazy things you know in the past few


---------78:09----------
years I mean yeah I'm a little loud and


---------78:12----------
crazy at times and I you know but it's


---------78:16----------
just my personality I think honestly so


---------78:20----------
let's talk about and I agree I mean I


---------78:22----------
think that this isn't this is a bipolar


---------78:25----------
this isn't you know it's not mama from


---------78:28----------
childhood or I mean it sounds like it's


---------78:30----------
pretty clear to me that you sort of get


---------78:32----------
an a very high amount of hate and


---------78:37----------
toxicity on a daily basis and just


---------78:39----------
thinking about the mind and the way that


---------78:41----------
I understand it you don't need to go


---------78:43----------
looking for another reason to feel like


---------78:45----------
[ __ ] yeah it's not like I mean we can


---------78:49----------
check a little bit but you know I think


---------78:53----------
the interesting thing I do think that


---------78:55----------
you can move forward from this and I


---------78:56----------
think the main thing has something to do


---------78:59----------
with sort of acceptance and


---------79:00----------
understanding that you can't control


---------79:02----------
people's perceptions and so I mean I


---------79:07----------
think I think I had already got into


---------79:09----------
that point yeah I just think like there


---------79:12----------
is a few things that happened recently


---------79:14----------
what happened dad like really got my my


---------79:18----------
whole barriers down


---------79:21----------
well it was like like everything I


---------79:23----------
wasn't going with my crowed and stuff


---------79:25----------
it's just been going like like in a


---------79:28----------
steady downhill and then like three days


---------79:32----------
ago for you know like five days ago


---------79:34----------
ninja made like a snarky comment at me


---------79:37----------
on Twitter and like his entire following


---------79:39----------
just destroyed my socials with like hate


---------79:43----------
and stuff like more than usual cuz he


---------79:47----------
has a lot of followers and so I spent


---------79:50----------
like all night just like reading really


---------79:52----------
nasty stuff and then the next morning I


---------79:56----------
wake up and I find out that Byron killed


---------79:58----------
himself and


---------80:01----------
I mean it that was just really hard


---------80:04----------
that was just really difficult for me to


---------80:06----------
process yeah because he was like one of


---------80:10----------
the oh geez and Wow like when I started


---------80:12----------
streaming that him and soda we're like


---------80:14----------
the other two wow streamers and like I


---------80:18----------
knew like he had struggle with mental


---------80:20----------
health for a long time and you know we


---------80:23----------
have we we hung out and the times that


---------80:25----------
we hung out like he was a nice guy he


---------80:27----------
was so sweet and he just like


---------80:30----------
I just feel so bad about it


---------80:35----------
yeah he was a really nice guy it's good


---------80:38----------
guy


---------80:43----------
yeah I think I think Ovid has been I


---------80:45----------
think four years or even decades people


---------80:49----------
are going to be studying the mental


---------80:50----------
health impacts of koban you know I


---------80:54----------
wouldn't even be surprised that people


---------80:56----------
are more hateful towards you because


---------80:58----------
they're sitting at home and have nowhere


---------80:59----------
to go


---------81:03----------
I think there's a lot of weird stuff


---------81:05----------
going on like part of me feels like I


---------81:07----------
don't deserve that like I don't I don't


---------81:10----------
deserve it to put myself in a position


---------81:12----------
in which that's what I have to do I


---------81:15----------
completely agree with you like in a way


---------81:18----------
I feel like I should protect myself from


---------81:21----------
this


---------81:22----------
what do you deserve


---------81:25----------
both good piece yeah I think we all


---------81:32----------
deserve peace


---------81:35----------
I think it's really really sad that


---------81:38----------
you're not able to find it yeah I mean


---------81:42----------
I've said this a couple of times and


---------81:44----------
telly I just don't know I mean we can


---------81:47----------
talk about toxicity we can talk about


---------81:48----------
stress we can but I just don't I don't


---------81:51----------
see a problem on your end like I know


---------81:55----------
it's kind of weird to say but I mean


---------81:56----------
maybe there is one I'm just saying I


---------81:58----------
don't see it I think do you try to


---------82:00----------
control things probably I think you know


---------82:02----------
you can think long and hard about I'm a


---------82:05----------
little bit of a control freak for sure


---------82:06----------
yeah so I think that generally speaking


---------82:08----------
people who are control freaks have high


---------82:13----------
trait neuroticism which is sort of a


---------82:15----------
personality characteristic from


---------82:17----------
something called the five factor model


---------82:18----------
and they tend to suffer more because


---------82:22----------
they kind of get bent out of shape yeah


---------82:25----------
you know there are all kinds of things


---------82:27----------
that we can tell you to do like read


---------82:29----------
less on social media spend less time on


---------82:32----------
social yeah it's like that I can


---------82:34----------
probably do that I probably do that I


---------82:37----------
try very hard to steer clear like even


---------82:40----------
though I sort of in a sense have you


---------82:42----------
know it's completely different in my


---------82:44----------
case because generally speaking I'm


---------82:46----------
lucky enough to have the opposite


---------82:48----------
narrative from what it sounds like you


---------82:49----------
got so my narrative on the Internet has


---------82:53----------
been overwhelmingly positive or at least


---------82:55----------
from what I've seen and so I'm lucky to


---------82:58----------
have that and I still try to steer clear


---------83:00----------
of it


---------83:00----------
yeah and just be careful you never know


---------83:04----------
when you like it can change absolutely


---------83:06----------
right so it's gonna change at some point


---------83:08----------
because that's what happens no one yeah


---------83:10----------
the more you get idealized the less the


---------83:13----------
more difficult it is the more you are


---------83:16----------
like every time that you're online every


---------83:18----------
time you say something like every second


---------83:21----------
year online you take a risk of like


---------83:24----------
somebody misinterpreting it or someone


---------83:26----------
saying something right and then like it


---------83:28----------
creates a lot of anxiety in me sometimes


---------83:30----------
like to the point where


---------83:34----------
I'm sometimes scared to stream


---------83:37----------
I feel like I'm gonna say something


---------83:39----------
wrong or I'm gonna say something bad and


---------83:41----------
it's gonna bring more hate sounds like a


---------83:44----------
very exhausting way to live in your head


---------83:47----------
yeah constantly calculating yeah


---------83:53----------
sounds the very opposite of like you


---------83:55----------
described yourself as carefree before


---------83:57----------
yes that's like your very different I


---------84:01----------
miss it so much


---------84:09----------
it hurts me a lot that I can't be like


---------84:11----------
that


---------84:19----------
yeah that makes sense to me


---------84:25----------
I think out of everything that I'm


---------84:26----------
hearing it's almost I don't know if


---------84:29----------
innocence is the right word but I think


---------84:30----------
carefree is like certainly the right


---------84:32----------
word what I'm hearing from you is that


---------84:33----------
you have to fight you're doing all these


---------84:36----------
calculations in your head all the time


---------84:38----------
about what you can and saying what you


---------84:41----------
should and shouldn't say and I hear that


---------84:47----------
you're kind of struggling to keep all


---------84:49----------
this hatred at bay as best as you can


---------84:51----------
like you're cleaning your life taking


---------84:53----------
out the trash and your Instagram every


---------84:55----------
morning it just sounds exhausting it


---------84:59----------
sounds like it's really starting to


---------85:00----------
affect you


---------85:06----------
yeah is there anything else I can do to


---------85:09----------
help


---------85:10----------
I don't think so I mean this was really


---------85:12----------
helpful I think no way oh so because I'm


---------85:17----------
not really feeling like I did very much


---------85:21----------
um I received some empathy which is nice


---------85:28----------
it's nice it's really really not to be


---------85:31----------
addressed innate it yeah so I like


---------85:39----------
talking to people who are nice so that


---------85:42----------
was nice talking to you was nice cut up


---------85:46----------
glass


---------85:49----------
happy to be a part of your public life


---------85:52----------
that is not filled with toxicity and


---------85:55----------
hatred but I think it's also kind of sad


---------85:59----------
that conversations like this or


---------86:03----------
interactions like this are not the norm


---------86:04----------
for you I think actually it's tragic


---------86:06----------
that the norm for you has changed so


---------86:10----------
drastically and what you have to deal


---------86:13----------
with sounds it sounds [ __ ] awful


---------86:15----------
that's all I gotta be honest I can't


---------86:16----------
imagine I've dealt with a lot of people


---------86:19----------
who have dealt with a lot of hatred but


---------86:23----------
honestly the sounds the worst if that


---------86:26----------
means anything to you tell me like


---------86:31----------
you're so strong you're so strong and


---------86:34----------
like I'm I appear really strong but like


---------86:39----------
it's so much work yeah so I thought it'd


---------86:43----------
work absolutely so I think you know


---------86:46----------
people called me strong as well and you


---------86:49----------
know I'm I'm happy people feel that way


---------86:52----------
but I wait yeah and I don't feel strong


---------86:54----------
yeah it's it's it's it's hard to


---------86:56----------
remember that it's like it ain't easy


---------86:58----------
being strong and you know I feel like


---------87:00----------
the fact that other people tell you


---------87:02----------
you're strong makes you feel like you


---------87:04----------
have to be more strong yes those people


---------87:07----------
are telling you that you have to be


---------87:09----------
strong mm-hmm yeah so I don't know if


---------87:12----------
it's a good thing actually because then


---------87:15----------
I'd for so long not to appear weak and I


---------87:18----------
think I just had a point like how to


---------87:20----------
break down yes I did I I don't think I


---------87:25----------
showed like my vulnerability for a long


---------87:27----------
time because I was trying to appear


---------87:28----------
strong so Natalia I think there are some


---------87:32----------
important lessons to be learned here I I


---------87:34----------
feel like for some reason now is not the


---------87:36----------
time to really go into them but the


---------87:38----------
first is to be careful about the


---------87:40----------
expectations that you set for yourself


---------87:42----------
because essentially what I'm hearing


---------87:44----------
from you first and foremost is that this


---------87:46----------
is a problem of expectation it's a


---------87:48----------
problem of what people's what people


---------87:51----------
expect from you it's a problem of


---------87:53----------
expectations that you can't get away


---------87:55----------
from because they interpret everything


---------87:57----------
through their lens and you have to be


---------88:00----------
careful because I think at some point I


---------88:02----------
mean there's got


---------88:03----------
it's got to be affecting you in terms of


---------88:04----------
the way that you think about yourself


---------88:07----------
and so be careful about you know even in


---------88:10----------
a weird way I'm not saying that like it


---------88:12----------
doesn't sound like you're starting to


---------88:14----------
believe them which is really good and


---------88:15----------
really healthy and at the same time you


---------88:18----------
may overcompensate based on that hatred


---------88:20----------
and become something that you actually


---------88:22----------
shouldn't be which is a little bit too


---------88:24----------
careful and and I think that there is


---------88:28----------
reason to be a little bit less I mean a


---------88:31----------
little bit less carefree and at the same


---------88:33----------
time I think it would be it would make


---------88:35----------
me really sad if you started becoming


---------88:37----------
someone who was overly careful that if


---------88:39----------
you couldn't let yourself cut loose from


---------88:42----------
time to time because you are a little


---------88:44----------
bit on the edge you are a little bit


---------88:45----------
funny you can say things that are a


---------88:47----------
little bit off-color and I think those


---------88:49----------
actually make you a wonderful person too


---------88:51----------
I definitely don't think that you should


---------88:54----------
you know you've got to be careful with


---------88:56----------
the alcohol and you should be careful


---------88:58----------
with your pets depending on what


---------89:00----------
actually happened but I mean it sounds


---------89:02----------
to me like you know you do care about


---------89:03----------
your pets a lot and and I mean you know


---------89:07----------
I'm allergic to cats and I have three


---------89:09----------
like they make me very sick I wouldn't


---------89:13----------
have them if I didn't love them yeah and


---------89:17----------
you know I think it's kind of sad if you


---------89:19----------
have to be I mean in a sense if they


---------89:21----------
make you be someone who's like overly


---------89:23----------
careful and doesn't open their mouth


---------89:25----------
like that's not that's not good right


---------89:28----------
sure maybe it'll reduce the hate but I


---------89:30----------
think the really challenging road for


---------89:32----------
you to walk is like not to try to reduce


---------89:35----------
the hate because that's not something


---------89:37----------
you can control and this comes back to


---------89:39----------
you by the way Frank the toilets yeah


---------89:41----------
like you have to you have to live a life


---------89:43----------
where not so much like you shouldn't do


---------89:45----------
things that foster hate or give them


---------89:47----------
ammo you have to be like careful about


---------89:49----------
that but at the same time you know


---------89:51----------
you're not going to be able to control


---------89:52----------
whether they hate you because they hate


---------89:54----------
you and can you find some piece of


---------89:57----------
yourself and it sounds like you can and


---------89:59----------
and really find Natalia or like who you


---------90:02----------
are on the inside and recognize that who


---------90:04----------
they hate is illinit ii and isn't all


---------90:06----------
yeah even then it sounds like I mean I


---------90:08----------
don't I don't think but I have to like


---------90:10----------
constantly remind myself of those things


---------90:12----------
you know yeah so that's where we're I


---------90:14----------
think we can change a little bit because


---------90:16----------
when you say constantly remind yourself


---------90:18----------
that sounds like a conscious


---------90:20----------
process yeah you're exerting in the top


---------90:23----------
of your mind


---------90:24----------
pushing down on certain feelings whereas


---------90:27----------
I think what would be cool is if if you


---------90:29----------
instead of constant reminders you felt


---------90:32----------
on the inside and kind of bubbled up


---------90:34----------
some senses like who you are that these


---------90:37----------
people aren't accurate that this is


---------90:39----------
coming from them yeah I think I think


---------90:43----------
this this comes from like


---------90:47----------
I have a very like weird sense and of


---------90:52----------
the world I guess this is gonna sound


---------90:54----------
really stupid but like


---------90:59----------
you


---------91:00----------
I believe that every person that exists


---------91:06----------
is like part of me as well


---------91:11----------
and so that has good and bad things sure


---------91:15----------
because it helps me treat everybody with


---------91:18----------
kindness but it also


---------91:22----------
makes it so that everybody's opinions


---------91:25----------
matter and way to me sure you know and


---------91:29----------
that is something that is really


---------91:32----------
difficult for me to make peace with


---------91:37----------
that's hard I don't think that's stupid


---------91:40----------
at all in fact there's a Sun script


---------91:43----------
phrase that actually capsule eights that


---------91:46----------
sentiment and that is but the bomb I see


---------91:50----------
so there are four Sun script sentences


---------91:53----------
that are called sort of the great


---------91:55----------
sentences which are kind of the


---------91:57----------
conclusions that all these like


---------91:59----------
enlightened Yogi's came to and that's so


---------92:03----------
I don't think it's stupid at all and


---------92:04----------
what but Pharmacy is literally


---------92:06----------
translated as I am that or that thou art


---------92:12----------
that that that you and me are actually


---------92:15----------
the same thing yeah I agree with that


---------92:20----------
and it makes it so difficult for me to


---------92:23----------
receive hate from people that I'm trying


---------92:25----------
to treat us being equal to myself yeah


---------92:31----------
so I feel like if I had if I had a huge


---------92:33----------
ego and I was able to be like oh I'm


---------92:35----------
better than everybody else their


---------92:36----------
opinions don't matter it can be easier


---------92:38----------
for me to tell what the hey


---------92:43----------
but if you think yeah I think you're


---------92:45----------
right I think also that you've stumbled


---------92:47----------
upon another important thing which is


---------92:48----------
that ego protects us from other people


---------92:51----------
and the fact that you're it sounds like


---------92:54----------
you're not very egotistical which in


---------92:56----------
turn means that you connect with them


---------92:58----------
more deeply which in turn means that you


---------92:59----------
bear more pain this is difficult


---------93:06----------
what are you feeling right now


---------93:10----------
I'm just feeling sad


---------93:15----------
because I sometimes I feel like my only


---------93:18----------
choice to not let things affect me is to


---------93:29----------
maybe changed the way how I view the


---------93:31----------
world


---------93:33----------
I think that'll help but I don't think


---------93:37----------
it's the right move


---------93:38----------
I don't right so either like I don't I I


---------93:41----------
I love the way that I view the world and


---------93:44----------
I don't


---------93:49----------
I don't know what to do


---------93:54----------
you


---------93:58----------
yeah sometimes I have answers for people


---------94:01----------
in Italia I don't have answers for you


---------94:03----------
yet but I do have some so the first


---------94:08----------
thing is that I have faith in you and I


---------94:10----------
don't think that you need to tank your


---------94:12----------
life to get away from it at the same


---------94:15----------
time if you feel like you do have to


---------94:16----------
quit streaming want to change your name


---------94:19----------
and move to even the further remote part


---------94:21----------
of sense catch you on then go for it


---------94:23----------
I wouldn't blame you at the same time I


---------94:26----------
think that what I've what I've come to


---------94:29----------
observe time and again is that I think


---------94:31----------
you say that you don't know what to do I


---------94:34----------
say I don't know what you should do and


---------94:36----------
at the same time the cool thing is that


---------94:38----------
we're doing something right now


---------94:40----------
and I wouldn't be surprised if you woke


---------94:43----------
up tomorrow morning and you felt better


---------94:45----------
in some way or had some kind of answer


---------94:48----------
so let me say this very clearly a lot of


---------94:52----------
times we're stuck in life and we don't


---------94:55----------
know what to do and the thing is like we


---------94:57----------
think okay I have to figure out what to


---------94:59----------
do like we have to figure out a plan to


---------95:00----------
move from like a twosie you don't have


---------95:03----------
to figure out a plan from A to Z all you


---------95:04----------
have to figure out is like a to B and


---------95:06----------
you don't know where Z is you don't know


---------95:08----------
where how to get there but in your case


---------95:10----------
what I would strongly encourage you to


---------95:12----------
do is like I don't know if you're


---------95:13----------
swimming today or what but you know


---------95:15----------
spend some time outside cuz it sounds


---------95:17----------
like it's a nice day because it's summer


---------95:18----------
and you're pretty far earth it sounds


---------95:20----------
like just spend some time outside spend


---------95:23----------
some times with your husband doing good


---------95:26----------
I haven't streamed since like like


---------95:29----------
Thursday okay yeah so so I think give


---------95:33----------
yourself some time and some space and


---------95:35----------
recognize that you're actually doing a


---------95:37----------
lot already and that that will start to


---------95:40----------
have effects and positive effects and so


---------95:45----------
you don't have to we don't have to


---------95:46----------
figure out what to do all we have to


---------95:48----------
figure out is like how are you gonna


---------95:50----------
what are you gonna do over the next day


---------95:51----------
and how are you gonna feel over the next


---------95:53----------
day and I wouldn't be surprised if you


---------95:55----------
start to feel better I think you should


---------95:59----------
reach out to your psychiatrist and let


---------96:00----------
them know that you're struggling that's


---------96:02----------
what they're there for


---------96:03----------
yeah and then the last thing is that you


---------96:07----------
know I think it's like figuring out what


---------96:09----------
to do is going to be an ongoing


---------96:11----------
basically and there's a part of me that


---------96:13----------
sort of says like don't give up


---------96:15----------
streaming because I I think so here's


---------96:17----------
the the other thing that I don't think


---------96:19----------
people realize like you know you're


---------96:20----------
creating something for a lot of people I


---------96:23----------
don't know what that is


---------96:26----------
and and but you're you're resonating


---------96:29----------
with people it sounds like you're a


---------96:31----------
pretty popular streamer so you know like


---------96:33----------
something is like you're doing something


---------96:34----------
that like is connecting with other human


---------96:37----------
beings you say you feel connected to


---------96:38----------
other people dr. Bamba so you call it


---------96:40----------
whatever you want to and I think that


---------96:42----------
you're doing that and it sounds like


---------96:43----------
that's what you're gonna ma that's their


---------96:46----------
daughter ma like you your that's what


---------96:47----------
your duty that's what your circumstances


---------96:50----------
have allowed you to do so I think you


---------96:51----------
should have been you doing that I love


---------96:54----------
doing that yeah so if you like playing


---------96:57----------
games and being a little bit you know


---------96:59----------
off-color and funny and sometimes you


---------97:01----------
speak out of turn


---------97:01----------
like I hope that you can get to a place


---------97:04----------
where you can actually be like a little


---------97:06----------
bit more of the person that you really


---------97:09----------
are and I I get that I think it's you


---------97:13----------
know you're gonna get hate for it but


---------97:15----------
sometimes when people hate you if you


---------97:19----------
start to like crumble a little bit like


---------97:21----------
that actually eggs them on more well


---------97:24----------
that's what I thought that's what I


---------97:25----------
thought you know that if I showed people


---------97:28----------
that it was hurting me that it would


---------97:32----------
make it happen more and that's why for


---------97:34----------
two years I remained super strong and


---------97:36----------
pretended like nothing affected me and I


---------97:38----------
think it actually made people angrier


---------97:40----------
yeah yeah so what I'm saying is not to


---------97:43----------
pretend like it doesn't affect you but


---------97:46----------
to actually think a little bit about


---------97:49----------
going back to the person that you used


---------97:51----------
to be alright and and going back I'm not


---------97:54----------
saying you know drink and do things no I


---------97:57----------
used to be like I think I I think I like


---------98:02----------
the qualities of my personality of yeah


---------98:05----------
you know like my dark humor and the fun


---------98:08----------
and stuff and I still have that I


---------98:09----------
haven't lost good I just I just have to


---------98:12----------
be more careful um I think there's like


---------98:15----------
a healthy amount of anxiety I can have


---------98:18----------
in order to ensure that I don't say


---------98:22----------
anything out of line just not


---------98:24----------
that because anxiety serves a good


---------98:26----------
purpose I'm just just not allowing that


---------98:29----------
anxiety to overtake me into getting in


---------98:33----------
my head and feeling like I can't speak


---------98:36----------
or do things yeah absolutely


---------98:39----------
I mean yeah I think part of the reason


---------98:41----------
that I don't know how to guide you is


---------98:43----------
because I think you understand a lot of


---------98:45----------
when I teach action and yeah one of the


---------98:49----------
big messages yeah and and so I think


---------98:52----------
your spirituality and stuff your yoga


---------98:54----------
and your meditation seems to be your


---------98:56----------
self-reflection seems to be paying off


---------98:58----------
and so let me leave you with one or two


---------99:01----------
last sentiments and if I can I'm gonna


---------99:02----------
I'm gonna try to do the thing where I


---------99:04----------
try to give people hope can I try - do


---------99:06----------
you have hope a little bit okay let me


---------99:11----------
try - let me try to feed that flame just


---------99:12----------
a tiny amount okay so Natalia I


---------99:17----------
recognize that you've been struggling


---------99:19----------
for a while and you're dealing with a


---------99:20----------
lot of hatred but I think it's actually


---------99:23----------
quite amazing that you are the person


---------99:25----------
that you are and what I mean by that is


---------99:28----------
that I think you're growing in ways that


---------99:30----------
are quite profound and I think a lot of


---------99:33----------
what you're saying and discovering is


---------99:35----------
actually making you like a better person


---------99:37----------
and I think it's making you into the


---------99:38----------
person that the world needs you to be


---------99:40----------
because here's the thing when it comes


---------99:43----------
to people expressing toxicity towards


---------99:45----------
towards twich thoughts is that right


---------99:48----------
yeah you're not the only one right


---------99:52----------
you're not the only person that people


---------99:54----------
hate sure they hate you the most it


---------99:56----------
sounds like but you're certainly not the


---------99:59----------
only woman out there who's getting hate


---------100:01----------
and it's not even just women right it's


---------100:03----------
like like people hate all kinds of


---------100:06----------
things and they just go like really


---------100:07----------
really hard on people like I don't know


---------100:09----------
why they hate so much but they hate so


---------100:11----------
much and I think that you are actually


---------100:14----------
making the world a better place by you


---------100:17----------
know going through this yourself and


---------100:19----------
sort of learning from it growing from it


---------100:21----------
and I think often times we don't realize


---------100:23----------
that when we're struggling the world is


---------100:26----------
sort of turning us into the person that


---------100:29----------
it needs and you know I think the


---------100:33----------
interesting thing is that people see


---------100:34----------
like dr. kay but they don't see like all


---------100:37----------
look at the age how old


---------100:37----------
if you don't mind me asking


---------100:41----------
okay nevermind you're not dead so so you


---------100:45----------
know assuming you're young but and I'm


---------100:49----------
making assumptions that I'm older than


---------100:52----------
you already - okay


---------100:54----------
so how are you I'm 37 okay so the story


---------100:59----------
doesn't quite apply well actually that


---------101:01----------
actually makes sense because that's why


---------101:02----------
I think I don't need to help you as much


---------101:04----------
because I think you've grown a lot so oh


---------101:08----------
yeah like if I was like in my 20s a


---------101:12----------
completely different story yeah I think


---------101:15----------
a lot of times as we're going through


---------101:18----------
the [ __ ] we don't realize what the [ __ ]


---------101:21----------
is gonna turn us into after a while and


---------101:24----------
what everyone sees in terms of like


---------101:26----------
strength is like the finished product


---------101:28----------
they don't see the process and I think


---------101:32----------
as long as you I see you sewing a lot of


---------101:35----------
positive karma karma so I see you doing


---------101:38----------
a lot of things for yourself to help


---------101:40----------
yourself out and it is my belief that if


---------101:42----------
you continue doing those things you're


---------101:45----------
gonna end up in a good place that you've


---------101:48----------
been on a journey of like


---------101:49----------
self-reflection and growth and stick


---------101:52----------
with it because as someone who I guess


---------101:54----------
is on the other side who's kind of come


---------101:56----------
out the other end of the tunnel I think


---------101:57----------
you're actually quite close hopefully


---------101:58----------
you know I mean hopefully suicide


---------102:01----------
doesn't win but III think I mean because


---------102:04----------
like I'm saying I I don't really see a


---------102:06----------
whole lot to help you with Natalia and I


---------102:08----------
think that's because I mean you do so


---------102:10----------
many things that are difficult to do you


---------102:12----------
walk the line between acknowledging that


---------102:14----------
you've done wrong and also thinking


---------102:16----------
you're a good person that nuance which


---------102:19----------
you hold is so difficult for so many


---------102:21----------
people if you think about our community


---------102:23----------
they think they're pieces of [ __ ] and


---------102:24----------
they do everything wrong right any


---------102:27----------
mistake they make reflects on their view


---------102:29----------
what the internet that you know how the


---------102:31----------
Internet has a narrative about you so


---------102:35----------
much of our community has a narrative


---------102:37----------
about themselves and they treat


---------102:39----------
themselves the way that the Internet


---------102:41----------
treats you and no matter what they do


---------102:44----------
they hate themselves they can't do


---------102:47----------
anything right


---------102:48----------
I I think like for the first like 20


---------102:52----------
years of my life I had to


---------102:54----------
deal with like learning to love myself


---------102:56----------
and I think maybe that was preparing the


---------103:00----------
for this moment absolutely and and so


---------103:04----------
you know I think you hopefully you're


---------103:06----------
prepared and you know whatever you end


---------103:09----------
up doing you know you're kind of on


---------103:11----------
behind you I mean not whenever I don't


---------103:14----------
want you to kill yourself you know


---------103:15----------
curses or a psychiatrist but like I


---------103:17----------
think if you decide that you need to


---------103:19----------
take a break from streaming or streaming


---------103:20----------
is that for you you know I wouldn't


---------103:22----------
blame you and at the same time I think


---------103:24----------
that sometimes amidst all of the hate


---------103:26----------
it's very very difficult to see the good


---------103:29----------
that you're doing and sometimes even


---------103:33----------
amongst all of the good it can be just


---------103:35----------
as hard to see the damage that you're


---------103:37----------
doing so that's something that we think


---------103:39----------
a lot about you know I think a lot about


---------103:42----------
whether what we do is ethical or helps


---------103:44----------
people or what seems like the answer is


---------103:46----------
yes but just because the world sends you


---------103:48----------
hate doesn't mean that you're doing a


---------103:50----------
bad job and if that's true the opposite


---------103:52----------
is also true that just because the world


---------103:54----------
sends you lots of love doesn't mean that


---------103:56----------
you're doing a good job and at the end


---------103:58----------
of the day you have to reflect and find


---------104:00----------
that answer for yourself you can't trust


---------104:02----------
them right yeah makes sense and I I


---------104:07----------
think you're gonna be I mean I hope


---------104:09----------
you're gonna be okay and I think that


---------104:11----------
you're doing what needs to be done by


---------104:13----------
having this conversation by thinking


---------104:15----------
about it by reflecting and I also think


---------104:18----------
that a lot of what you need is not going


---------104:20----------
to come it's not something that you can


---------104:22----------
do it's something that we as a community


---------104:23----------
have to help you with which is exploring


---------104:26----------
that the nature of hatred and toxicity


---------104:28----------
and trying to get underneath that


---------104:30----------
because there is just no way Natalia I I


---------104:33----------
don't know how else to say this there is


---------104:35----------
no way that you have done anything that


---------104:38----------
there's random people on the internet


---------104:41----------
who you never met and who have never met


---------104:43----------
you and for them to hate you so much


---------104:45----------
has nothing to [ __ ] do with you it


---------104:46----------
has to do with that like to do that make


---------104:48----------
sense


---------104:48----------
like you're allowed to hate people who


---------104:50----------
like you know steal yeah right so like


---------104:57----------
that that amount of hatred like it just


---------104:59----------
doesn't make any rational sense for you


---------105:02----------
to just pick a random person on the


---------105:04----------
internet and decide that like you're


---------105:06----------
gonna spend day in and


---------105:07----------
out trying to make that person kill


---------105:09----------
themselves I think like for example in


---------105:11----------
my case though it has to do with


---------105:15----------
people who follow certain like in like


---------105:20----------
influencers and then that influencer has


---------105:22----------
a problem with me and so they attacked


---------105:26----------
me because of the problem that I have


---------105:29----------
with a person that they follow yeah but


---------105:32----------
still that still has nothing to do with


---------105:33----------
you right because like if there are


---------105:35----------
people who are extensions of an


---------105:38----------
influencers will then it's still a


---------105:40----------
problem for that person like why do you


---------105:42----------
why are you directing your thoughts and


---------105:45----------
beliefs based on a particular person


---------105:47----------
myself included oh I understand that but


---------105:51----------
what I was trying to say as there are


---------105:52----------
like people that follow certain others


---------105:57----------
like for example keemstar Teamster has a


---------106:00----------
large large following and he likes to


---------106:02----------
talk people and his followers go and


---------106:04----------
attack people so I do think that a


---------106:06----------
problem I'm not saying like in video


---------106:09----------
game hate but in the problem that I'm


---------106:11----------
facing myself has to do with


---------106:15----------
him having a platform in which he is


---------106:18----------
allowed to hate people and not just me


---------106:21----------
like he like said that some guy was a


---------106:24----------
pedophile and like he wasn't and it was


---------106:28----------
just like horrible for him he like lust


---------106:30----------
is gently I don't know the whole story


---------106:31----------
but it's really sad one um and I just


---------106:34----------
don't think that a person should be


---------106:36----------
allowed to say things without having any


---------106:37----------
proof you know yeah I mean I that makes


---------106:41----------
sense to me I think it's that that also


---------106:43----------
is sort of a societal problem like I


---------106:45----------
think this kind of goes back to like


---------106:47----------
it's not on you though right it's not


---------106:49----------
that you're doing something wrong it's


---------106:50----------
that I mean I think we've got a family


---------106:53----------
I've made mistake I have made mistakes


---------106:55----------
but I haven't killed anybody


---------106:56----------
you know yeah like I I think like I


---------106:58----------
think I even like murders don't get the


---------107:01----------
amount of hate I get yeah yeah sounds


---------107:04----------
it's rough yeah so listen any any


---------107:10----------
thoughts the kind of questions before we


---------107:13----------
sort of I was kind of thinking about


---------107:15----------
winding down we've been at it for about


---------107:16----------
an hour and a half even a little bit


---------107:19----------
longer yeah like two hours almost um no


---------107:22----------
I I feel better I think like that you


---------107:26----------
look like you're yeah the whole idea


---------107:28----------
that I'm still gonna cry but the whole


---------107:30----------
idea that I just can't control like the


---------107:32----------
narrative you know no matter what I do I


---------107:35----------
think it gives me a sense of


---------107:38----------
maybe like I don't have to worry about


---------107:39----------
it as much like if I can't control it


---------107:41----------
then like I I can't do anything about it


---------107:43----------
so I think it's just maybe gonna be like


---------107:45----------
not exposing myself to that hate as much


---------107:47----------
as I can and like try and protect myself


---------107:49----------
so I don't have to treat those things as


---------107:51----------
much and I do have some measures in


---------107:53----------
place a lot I don't know how to read


---------107:55----------
those things so I think I'll be working


---------107:58----------
on that good


---------107:59----------
so Natalia just to kind of clarify a


---------108:03----------
little bit I don't think you can control


---------108:04----------
the narrative but what I would say is


---------108:06----------
that so the way I would frame it is that


---------108:08----------
you can't control how they receive what


---------108:10----------
you do but you can absolutely control


---------108:13----------
what you do yeah but whatever you do


---------108:18----------
it's gonna get misinterpret like


---------108:20----------
whatever I do it's can I get


---------108:21----------
misinterpreted I already know that yeah


---------108:23----------
yeah and and so just be careful because


---------108:25----------
sometimes people take that I'm not


---------108:28----------
getting the sense from you to a license


---------108:29----------
to do whatever the [ __ ] they want right


---------108:32----------
because I'm not getting that from you


---------108:34----------
but I was just for the people watching


---------108:36----------
like I you know I think it's an


---------108:37----------
important distinction to make that


---------108:39----------
you're not gonna you know run around


---------108:40----------
hitting people and things like that but


---------108:44----------
that to understand that fundamentally is


---------108:46----------
a human being you're in control of your


---------108:47----------
actions but not the consequences of your


---------108:51----------
actions


---------108:51----------
and the reason that I have hope for you


---------108:53----------
Natalia is because I think at the end of


---------108:55----------
the day the way that you were acting day


---------108:57----------
to day is not correlating with what you


---------109:01----------
receive the fact that you're being


---------109:03----------
spiritual the fact that you're


---------109:05----------
reflecting on what you do the fact that


---------109:06----------
you're being thoughtful about what you


---------109:08----------
say I think all of those are seeds that


---------109:11----------
you've planted which are gonna bear


---------109:13----------
fruit months from now or even years from


---------109:16----------
now the person that you're gonna you're


---------109:18----------
becoming is the person that you're gonna


---------109:20----------
be with for the rest of your life and


---------109:22----------
that's the person I can get behind I


---------109:25----------
think what you're dealing with now is


---------109:27----------
the bitter fruits of seeds that you


---------109:29----------
sowed many years ago yeah and the


---------109:32----------
hardest period of time is when you're


---------109:34----------
reaping your bad fruit and sowing your


---------109:37----------
good seeds and it can feel like you


---------109:39----------
really really want to give up but in my


---------109:41----------
overwhelming experience if you stick


---------109:43----------
through it and you do the right thing


---------109:44----------
that starts to turn the tide and I


---------109:47----------
really do hope that that tide turns for


---------109:49----------
you


---------109:52----------
looks like anything emotional again okay


---------110:01----------
yeah so sometimes I teach people how to


---------110:05----------
meditate I think if you're feeling


---------110:07----------
emotional we don't what do you feel like


---------110:10----------
doing do you want to meditate or not bad


---------110:11----------
no I just I just I cry when like a


---------110:14----------
person says something that I believe is


---------110:16----------
true and then it makes me sad about


---------110:17----------
myself why I'm not crying because I'm


---------110:20----------
feeling sad I'm crying because I relate


---------110:21----------
well you just said yep that's for you so


---------110:24----------
you know just so you know it's just it's


---------110:26----------
the way my emotions work I guess yeah


---------110:28----------
that's that's a very healthy way for


---------110:29----------
them to work that's all okay so what do


---------110:34----------
you think you want to meditate a little


---------110:35----------
bit what do you sounds like your


---------110:38----------
bathroom


---------110:38----------
okay go use about them okay okay


---------110:42----------
revelation number two ink let's see what


---------110:50----------
back with this okay so I got to think


---------110:56----------
about what kind of meditation we teach


---------111:09----------
you


---------112:16----------
you


---------112:18----------
you


---------112:21----------
you


---------112:23----------
I'm feeling a lot better actually


---------112:26----------
good yeah hmm so if you wanted so tell


---------112:34----------
me guys me a little bit


---------112:36----------
I teach different kinds of meditations


---------112:39----------
depending on what people's goals are and


---------112:41----------
in your case I see a couple of different


---------112:44----------
options one is something that's a little


---------112:46----------
bit more spiritual and some others like


---------112:48----------
something that's a little bit more


---------112:50----------
emotional like what are you looking to


---------112:51----------
gain from meditation oh I don't want to


---------112:54----------
get more emotional I'm already so


---------112:55----------
emotional um so you want to be like like


---------112:59----------
less emotional like control your


---------113:00----------
emotions I just wanna be calm okay


---------113:08----------
so I'll give you a choice I can teach me


---------113:11----------
a technique that will help you calm


---------113:12----------
yourself down a little bit or I can


---------113:15----------
teach you a technique that will help you


---------113:18----------
sort of more on a sort of more spiritual


---------113:22----------
level like thinking about your


---------113:23----------
connectedness to other people and that


---------113:25----------
kind of [ __ ] what do you prefer so let's


---------113:27----------
do the first one I'm already really


---------113:28----------
connected to people okay great awesome


---------113:34----------
so let's start by sitting up straight


---------113:37----------
and now I have to think about which one


---------113:39----------
to do how clogged is your nose not that


---------113:44----------
much okay so hmm let me blow it okay I'm


---------113:49----------
gonna teach you something called


---------113:51----------
triphasic breathing okay okay so what


---------113:57----------
we're gonna do is actually so that


---------113:58----------
there's cool thing about the mind is


---------114:01----------
that it's very connected to the breath


---------114:03----------
and depending on how we breathe it sort


---------114:06----------
of creates certain emotions and some


---------114:08----------
emotions actually create certain breath


---------114:10----------
patterns so if someone's like scared


---------114:13----------
they'll breathe like right that's the


---------114:18----------
breath pattern of fear breath measure of


---------114:21----------
anger is a little bit different so if we


---------114:27----------
actually adjusts our breathing and we


---------114:29----------
kind of know this because we'll tell


---------114:31----------
people to take deep breaths and if they


---------114:32----------
take deep breaths they kind of calm down


---------114:34----------
so how does that work we're not


---------114:35----------
whatever but there are particular breath


---------114:37----------
patterns that I'm gonna teach you that


---------114:39----------
hopefully will kind of calm you down


---------114:41----------
okay okay we'll help you sort of process


---------114:44----------
or separate yourself from your emotions


---------114:46----------
and do you know how to belly breather


---------114:49----------
abdominally breathe like breathe with


---------114:51----------
your stomach instead of your chest okay


---------114:54----------
yeah so take a deep breath in excellent


---------114:58----------
and then out very good beautiful okay so


---------115:03----------
what we're gonna do is triphasic


---------115:05----------
breathing so the first phase is going to


---------115:06----------
be belly breathing so we're gonna do


---------115:08----------
three breaths with our with our about so


---------115:10----------
for those of y'all who are watching so


---------115:12----------
what we want to do is on the inhalation


---------115:14----------
if you guys notice Natalya's stomach is


---------115:18----------
gonna come out is she breathe them


---------115:19----------
beautiful do you guys see that and then


---------115:21----------
as you exhale the stomach goes back in


---------115:23----------
it's great because you have those little


---------115:25----------
things on your pants so you can see them


---------115:27----------
move good beautiful I see Matt okay good


---------115:36----------
and now Natalia what I want you to do is


---------115:41----------
when you take a breath in with your


---------115:43----------
stomach when you're at full breath pause


---------115:46----------
for a second and then breathe in a


---------115:48----------
little bit more and then expand your


---------115:49----------
chest so do belly first and then chest


---------115:55----------
it's hard it is hard it's supposed to be


---------115:58----------
okay okay


---------116:00----------
start with just the belly okay just like


---------116:05----------
you were doing and now incorporate the


---------116:07----------
chest right there you feel that a little


---------116:09----------
bit more and then out slowly good


---------116:13----------
let's do three of those


---------116:18----------
breathe in with the valley expand the


---------116:23----------
chest and then out expound the belly


---------116:33----------
well no it's just I feel it immediately


---------116:37----------
yep


---------116:38----------
keep going focus


---------116:42----------
I have a very hyperactive item I know I


---------116:45----------
mean that's okay that's why we're gonna


---------116:47----------
breathe good so notice that humor notice


---------116:51----------
it within yourself good and returning to


---------116:52----------
the breath


---------116:53----------
beautiful Italian just like you did good


---------116:55----------

---------116:57----------
comment about what we're seeing and I


---------116:59----------
want you to listen to what I'm saying


---------117:01----------
notice that what I'm saying is gonna try


---------117:04----------
to create a reaction in your mind and


---------117:05----------
focus on the breath so we can see


---------117:08----------
there's a slight smile it's starting to


---------117:10----------
calm down as we talk about Natalia the


---------117:13----------
smile may him peace she may feel more


---------117:15----------
self-conscious just listen to the words


---------117:19----------
see there's the humor good so now she


---------117:21----------
ranks and now returned to the breath


---------117:27----------
moment that I'm not talking about you


---------117:29----------
just listen to the sound of my voice and


---------117:32----------
breathe in with the belly expand the


---------117:38----------
chest and then out


---------117:43----------
you can see with the exhalation calmness


---------117:45----------
returning to the face there's a pleasant


---------117:48----------
neutral slight positive expression


---------117:51----------
breathe again


---------117:55----------
but now Natalia


---------118:00----------
to try to break apart the abdomen and


---------118:03----------
the chest so do the valley first and


---------118:05----------
then the chest


---------118:05----------
Valley first slowly good now add the


---------118:09----------
chest good and now out now we're gonna


---------118:14----------
do phase three okay so when belly is


---------118:18----------

---------119:27----------
I don't know where you get that idea but


---------119:29----------
we're just gonna keep going okay set


---------119:32----------
that aside that's a judgment about


---------119:33----------
yourself


---------119:34----------

---------119:37----------
eyes closed back straight you're having


---------119:41----------

---------119:52----------
yeah yeah so let's try one more time no


---------119:55----------
there's people watching and you're


---------119:57----------

---------122:30----------
that was good thank you for taking the


---------122:33----------
time to talk to me thank you for coming


---------122:35----------
on and and sharing with everyone yeah I


---------122:39----------
like that project that you're in of


---------122:42----------
figuring out you know the whole hate


---------122:45----------
thing and stuff if I can help you with


---------122:47----------
it at all let me know you know honestly


---------122:50----------
we're trying to figure it out but my


---------122:52----------
first thought is that if you want to


---------122:53----------
send some of your haters our way like


---------122:55----------
I'd love to talk to them I'm serious


---------122:59----------
okay I just don't know if my haters with


---------123:04----------
do something that


---------123:07----------
I give you their Twitter account yeah


---------123:11----------
we're gonna like them


---------123:12----------
we're gonna have to figure that out yeah


---------123:14----------
if I tell them to go to you they're not


---------123:17----------
gonna do that right right sorry for them


---------123:19----------
like I get a lot of hateful twitter them


---------123:21----------
so I can just send you three so so what


---------123:24----------
profiles and you can contact them so I


---------123:27----------
have to be a little bit careful because


---------123:29----------
I'm kind of a boomer and sometimes I get


---------123:31----------
into situations that are not good for me


---------123:33----------
so let me talk to my staff about how to


---------123:36----------
actually do something about this because


---------123:38----------
we want to do this we want to talk to


---------123:41----------
haters at some point cuz I think we have


---------123:42----------
to write to understand what's in their


---------123:45----------
mind yeah and and at the same time I


---------123:49----------
don't want you to send all of your


---------123:51----------
haters our way because you're pretty


---------123:53----------
good at surviving the hate and I'm still


---------123:54----------
new at it so I don't know if I can


---------123:57----------
handle it yet


---------123:58----------
I think they hate me I don't think they


---------124:00----------
hate everybody I don't know but if I'm


---------124:03----------
friendly towards you maybe I'm putting a


---------124:05----------
target on my back oh noes anyway we'll


---------124:08----------
sort it out we'll reach out to you soon


---------124:10----------
I think what we have to we really do


---------124:12----------
have to figure this out okay


---------124:13----------
all right yeah don't count on me for


---------124:15----------
whatever and I'm gonna say something


---------124:17----------
about you after I hang up with you that


---------124:19----------
I want you to watch on the bog tomorrow


---------124:22----------
is that okay I want you to just think


---------124:24----------
about this for a second but I'm gonna


---------124:26----------
comment a little bit about this


---------124:27----------
meditation technique I'm gonna teach the


---------124:29----------
rest of twitch but I don't want you to


---------124:31----------
watch it right now okay yeah I want you


---------124:34----------
just think for a second they think for a


---------124:36----------
day and then you can watch that more


---------124:38----------
okay all right take care you too thanks


---------124:42----------
good luck bye okay bye okay so no


---------124:48----------
spoilery no all right so here's the


---------124:50----------
thing to understand so this technique is


---------124:52----------
gonna be really important for her


---------124:54----------
because she was trying to figure out how


---------124:56----------
to block out like she was like people


---------125:01----------
are watching and you're talking and


---------125:03----------
that's hard


---------125:04----------
absolutely that's why you need to do


---------125:07----------
this technique because if you can learn


---------125:09----------
how to block out for just a few moments


---------125:13----------
everyone watching and me talking to you


---------125:15----------
that's what she needs


---------125:17----------
she needs a place in her mind where she


---------125:20----------
escaped what she wants his escape and


---------125:23----------
like even for 15 minutes a day if she


---------125:26----------
can escape from everyone watching


---------125:28----------
because she takes the people that are


---------125:30----------
watching with her in her mind I don't


---------125:33----------
know if you guys like if that makes


---------125:34----------
sense but the Twitter dm's follow her


---------125:37----------
throughout the day right like they go


---------125:38----------
with her they like infect her mind and


---------125:41----------
they like propagate in her thoughts and


---------125:43----------
even with all of that simulation she's


---------125:46----------
really got to do this kind of technique


---------125:47----------
because she needs to give her space


---------125:49----------
escaping is not about changing her


---------125:52----------
circumstances although that certainly


---------125:53----------
helps


---------125:54----------
she needs to escape by doing that by all


---------125:56----------
means but the really crazy thing is that


---------125:58----------
you can escape from all of that stuff


---------126:00----------
right here and and she can escape from


---------126:05----------
all of the hatred in her own mind


---------126:07----------
through like dedication in the practice


---------126:09----------
and she's well on that journey already


---------126:11----------
to be honest it's really cool and maybe


---------126:15----------
streaming is that for her absolutely


---------126:16----------
maybe it's not for her that's a decision


---------126:18----------
she's got to make on Raw but if we can


---------126:21----------
equip her with a tool that if she


---------126:23----------
decides that she does love it which it


---------126:25----------
sounds like she does then we want to


---------126:27----------
help her do what she loves and and if we


---------126:30----------
can protect a little bit from the hatred


---------126:32----------
by giving her a space in her mind to


---------126:35----------
ignore my words and ignore that


---------126:38----------
everyone's watching because that's what


---------126:39----------
she's trying to do let's help her do it


---------126:41----------
and and hopefully it'll help okay so


---------126:46----------
[Music]


---------126:52----------
uh okay so
