---------00:00----------
cool so welcome thank you


---------00:03----------
i think someone asked me a loaded


---------00:05----------
question about what i thought about


---------00:06----------
polyamorous relationships i don't know


---------00:07----------
if you heard my answer


---------00:09----------
wait what was your answer my answer was


---------00:11----------
i haven't seen many that are or i


---------00:13----------
haven't seen really any that are very


---------00:14----------
successful but there's a big selection


---------00:16----------
bias because the people who tend to come


---------00:17----------
to me tend to be unhappy with something


---------00:21----------
right so all the happy people in


---------00:22----------
polyamorous relationships probably never


---------00:24----------
end


---------00:24----------
walk in my door i think i think it all


---------00:27----------
depends on what the relationship


---------00:28----------
is like right like sure that too


---------00:32----------
like there's like tons of relationships


---------00:34----------
that are monogamous that don't work out


---------00:36----------
either


---------00:36----------
absolutely yes i think it all depends on


---------00:39----------
like where the boundaries are and stuff


---------00:40----------
like that and like


---------00:42----------
i mean i feel like there definitely has


---------00:44----------
to be like more trust and stuff


---------00:47----------
in an open or polyamorous relationship


---------00:49----------
and


---------00:50----------
you need to like balance each other out


---------00:52----------
i think yeah


---------00:53----------
and if you don't yeah then it's gonna be


---------00:56----------
even worse probably than a monogamous


---------00:58----------
relationship


---------00:59----------
i think if there's like more of a


---------01:01----------
difference


---------01:02----------
yeah i think that's a really good point


---------01:04----------
that a lot of monogamous relationships


---------01:06----------
are [ __ ]


---------01:08----------
i think i feel like most relationships


---------01:11----------
are [ __ ] somehow


---------01:15----------
i think every every relationship has


---------01:17----------
something that is like not


---------01:19----------
very very wise words yeah


---------01:24----------
um but i mean if you ask people on the


---------01:26----------
internet especially like


---------01:28----------
twitch people on the internet maybe


---------01:30----------
don't really have a lot of experience


---------01:31----------
when it comes to relationships so when


---------01:33----------
they see that there's something that is


---------01:34----------
bad


---------01:35----------
they judge like everything like so hard


---------01:37----------
too so


---------01:38----------
yeah of course i don't think anyone is


---------01:40----------
like perfect do you feel like your


---------01:41----------
relationship is perfect


---------01:42----------
good god no no yeah and that's i am


---------01:46----------
i don't think people know that there's a


---------01:47----------
thing yeah yeah


---------01:50----------
thank you for having me again yeah i


---------01:52----------
think


---------01:53----------
april i think yes it was a while ago


---------01:56----------
yeah so tell me how have you been


---------01:59----------
um it's been like it's been good and bad


---------02:03----------
um after our last talk


---------02:07----------
i feel like it's been pretty good


---------02:08----------
because i


---------02:10----------
um i built my whole twitch carrier since


---------02:12----------
then basically so that's pretty cool


---------02:15----------
um congratulations yeah thank you that


---------02:18----------
was


---------02:18----------
yeah that was really nice it made me


---------02:20----------
really happy um i built like my own


---------02:22----------
community and everything so it was


---------02:24----------
really fun


---------02:25----------
i've traveled around in europe and stuff


---------02:27----------
and met friends and hung out with people


---------02:29----------
and stuff


---------02:30----------
um the pandemic and the long distance


---------02:32----------
relationship thing went on for about 10


---------02:34----------
months


---------02:35----------
that was really hard um


---------02:38----------
yeah and i think especially recently


---------02:42----------
maybe like the past


---------02:43----------
four or five months has been pretty hard


---------02:46----------
with people breaking my trust


---------02:48----------
okay and that's why i wanted to come


---------02:51----------
here now today


---------02:52----------
okay four to five months of people


---------02:54----------
breaking your trust sounds like a long


---------02:56----------
time


---------02:57----------
yeah i mean it's been it's been longer


---------03:00----------
than that it's just like the past five


---------03:01----------
months has been like


---------03:02----------
almost every single person almost


---------03:05----------
uh that i'm really really close friends


---------03:07----------
with that's


---------03:08----------
terrible yeah


---------03:12----------
what happened and i think i mean there's


---------03:15----------
i don't know i i just feel like


---------03:17----------
um


---------03:21----------
i just i feel like there's so many


---------03:24----------
people that i like that come like very


---------03:26----------
very close and i'm like a very open


---------03:28----------
like happy person that wants to let


---------03:30----------
people in i just want to have fun and


---------03:32----------
stuff like that


---------03:33----------
but whenever there's like something that


---------03:34----------
they're not getting in their way of


---------03:36----------
or um when they feel like they can get


---------03:38----------
something out of me


---------03:40----------
they don't give a [ __ ] about how i feel


---------03:43----------
anymore and they do something


---------03:45----------
and yeah i don't know i don't i don't


---------03:47----------
really understand like why they're doing


---------03:49----------
the things that they're doing and it's


---------03:51----------
it's like almost every single one


---------03:53----------
even people that i consider in my best


---------03:55----------
friends would do something really really


---------03:57----------
terrible


---------03:59----------
so let me just make sure i kind of


---------04:02----------
understood you so it seems like you know


---------04:04----------
you tend to


---------04:05----------
be pretty open you let people into your


---------04:07----------
life


---------04:08----------
um and that you've noticed recently that


---------04:11----------
people


---------04:12----------
if they can kind of get ahead in some


---------04:13----------
way they'll take advantage of your


---------04:15----------
openness


---------04:17----------
yeah and then like it it can


---------04:20----------
i don't know it just kind of like feels


---------04:21----------
like they don't give a [ __ ] and like and


---------04:23----------
when i


---------04:24----------
when i call them out on it or just


---------04:27----------
like explain like this like this really


---------04:29----------
[ __ ] hurts


---------04:30----------
they usually just wanna like blame it on


---------04:32----------
me or something or just say that i


---------04:34----------
should just take it and that i shouldn't


---------04:36----------
be sad about it and


---------04:37----------
and and like there's some cases where i


---------04:40----------
decide to just cut them off


---------04:42----------
and i just can't because it's too much


---------04:43----------
and i just feel like i don't want to be


---------04:45----------
around these people anymore because it


---------04:47----------
hurts so much


---------04:48----------
and then they're the ones that's like


---------04:51----------
always like messaging


---------04:53----------
and it's like trying i don't know


---------04:56----------
to like make me feel bad about how i'm


---------04:58----------
feeling maybe a little bit and then


---------05:01----------
um it feels like everyone is like acting


---------05:04----------
very selfish


---------05:05----------
and that they have they just like oh


---------05:07----------
yeah whatever like it's like that a


---------05:08----------
little bit about like how i feel about


---------05:11----------
things um or that they just don't give a


---------05:15----------
[ __ ]


---------05:16----------
um i had a person i think


---------05:19----------
a lot of people like that's watching


---------05:20----------
like knows what happened recently


---------05:22----------
but um i think the thing that hurts the


---------05:26----------
most from that situation was that i had


---------05:28----------
a person that i consider my best friend


---------05:30----------
um


---------05:31----------
just leaking logs of my deepest darkest


---------05:35----------
thoughts


---------05:36----------
to the whole world and


---------05:39----------
this is sounds like a pretty big


---------05:41----------
violation of your trust


---------05:43----------
yeah um


---------05:46----------
why would they do that i i don't know


---------05:49----------
that's i try to catch a question myself


---------05:52----------
if there if there's something i'm doing


---------05:54----------
wrong


---------05:55----------
well you know that's an interesting


---------05:56----------
question because um


---------06:00----------
so i'm not really hearing anything yet


---------06:03----------
but one thing that i have noticed molina


---------06:05----------
is that you know sometimes people will


---------06:08----------
say


---------06:09----------
everyone does this to me or there are a


---------06:11----------
lot of different people who do this to


---------06:13----------
me


---------06:14----------
and sometimes i kind of think a little


---------06:16----------
bit about


---------06:18----------
if there's a common conflict that you


---------06:20----------
have in multiple relationships


---------06:22----------
it's really important to think about


---------06:24----------
your contribution to that conflict


---------06:26----------
because the common element


---------06:28----------
that's what i'm trying to do like the


---------06:29----------
muslims if all of these people are doing


---------06:32----------
this and like i am the common like


---------06:34----------
aspect about everything that has to do


---------06:36----------
with me right um


---------06:38----------
yeah unfortunately sometimes that's true


---------06:41----------
yeah and figure that out


---------06:44----------
yeah so so like i'll give you just one


---------06:46----------
example of that okay so


---------06:48----------
even then it's not necessarily that it's


---------06:50----------
your fault


---------06:51----------
but like um you know i've worked with


---------06:53----------
women who end up in


---------06:54----------
and men so let's use an example of a man


---------06:57----------
i'm thinking about one person in


---------06:58----------
particular


---------06:58----------
who tends to end up in toxic and abusive


---------07:01----------
relationships like he gets into like


---------07:02----------
toxic and abusive relation girlfriend


---------07:04----------
after girlfriend after girlfriend


---------07:06----------
and um and you know they'll they'll be


---------07:09----------
like


---------07:09----------
like he'll like his last three


---------07:12----------
girlfriends have like physically abused


---------07:13----------
him


---------07:14----------
and so he's like is it something i'm


---------07:16----------
doing and it sort of turns out that


---------07:18----------
early on


---------07:20----------
um in in terms of like the way he meets


---------07:22----------
people and who he feels it's just


---------07:24----------
interesting because he's kind of like a


---------07:26----------
macho kind of guy he actually sort of


---------07:29----------
selects for partners


---------07:32----------
who sort of have those kind of abusive


---------07:34----------
characteristics


---------07:36----------
and he actually feels like really really


---------07:38----------
like frightened and confused when he's


---------07:40----------
like dating someone who's like caring


---------07:43----------
um and and so sometimes it can be


---------07:45----------
something as simple as like the kinds of


---------07:47----------
people that you choose to associate with


---------07:50----------
um and and you know because sometimes


---------07:52----------
people will like


---------07:54----------
kind of hang out with drama-oriented


---------07:57----------
people and


---------07:58----------
if you hang out with drama-oriented


---------07:59----------
people you may find drama


---------08:01----------
yeah but i i do think it's


---------08:05----------
it's it can be challenging but i also


---------08:07----------
think it's like really


---------08:10----------
awesome that you're thinking about your


---------08:11----------
contribution to these situations


---------08:14----------
yeah i just kind of like i cannot i


---------08:17----------
don't know


---------08:18----------
can you help me understand a little bit


---------08:19----------
about you know what's happened recently


---------08:21----------
and


---------08:22----------
and how it's affected you um


---------08:27----------
basically what happened is that i i got


---------08:29----------
a friend named bob


---------08:31----------
i about in april as we start talking


---------08:34----------
um i kind of didn't


---------08:38----------
open up to anyone about anything almost


---------08:41----------
for a pretty long time because i felt


---------08:43----------
like if i wanted


---------08:43----------
if i started to like vent to people that


---------08:45----------
would um


---------08:47----------
cause problems um


---------08:50----------
or like everything when i get dramatics


---------08:52----------
i didn't say anything or talk to anyone


---------08:54----------
about anything and that could feel


---------08:55----------
pretty hard to like if you're not if you


---------08:57----------
don't have like a friend to vent to or


---------08:58----------
something like that because i


---------09:00----------
because i didn't i didn't want to like


---------09:01----------
make anyone look bad or anything like


---------09:03----------
that


---------09:03----------
um and then i think in october


---------09:07----------
or something like that like we started


---------09:09----------
becoming like closer friends


---------09:10----------
and then i started um i


---------09:13----------
went into some dark phase when i just


---------09:16----------
didn't


---------09:17----------
yeah i don't know you know like when you


---------09:20----------
start feeling so bad you almost have


---------09:21----------
like no control of yourself and it feels


---------09:23----------
like your


---------09:24----------
body is like an autopilot and you yeah


---------09:27----------
and that was like the only person that i


---------09:28----------
ever like told all of my thoughts


---------09:30----------
to and um


---------09:33----------
what happened a few weeks after that was


---------09:35----------
that


---------09:36----------
bob told one of steven's close friends


---------09:40----------
all of the stuff that i told him which


---------09:43----------
was really hard for steven's friend


---------09:45----------
because they were friends and she felt


---------09:48----------
worried about


---------09:49----------
me and felt worried about stephen about


---------09:51----------
our relationship because it was pretty


---------09:52----------
crazy stuff


---------09:53----------
um so she she thought she was like


---------09:57----------
super super against me she was super


---------09:59----------
against that relationship


---------10:01----------
i felt super super betrayed and wait


---------10:04----------
about one huh i'm confused why would


---------10:07----------
this person feel against


---------10:09----------
it sounds like this person is friends


---------10:10----------
with even his destiny by the way


---------10:12----------
yeah and so this person was afraid of


---------10:16----------
how your thoughts would affect y'all's


---------10:17----------
relationship i'm


---------10:19----------
a little bit confused and like thought


---------10:22----------
like badly of him and thought badly of


---------10:24----------
me and everything was just so crazy and


---------10:27----------
yeah i'm okay i'm i


---------10:30----------
just lost me just he basically just told


---------10:32----------
this person


---------10:33----------
all of this like all of my deepest


---------10:36----------
darkest


---------10:37----------
secrets and just like everything which


---------10:39----------
was also like a lot of problems in


---------10:41----------
mine and siemens relationship and that


---------10:43----------
comes from like


---------10:44----------
being away from each other for 10 months


---------10:46----------
um


---------10:48----------
a lot of like things that i went through


---------10:51----------
at the time and like things that he went


---------10:53----------
through so there was like a lot of


---------10:54----------
things that was like


---------10:56----------
not meant for like other people to hear


---------10:58----------
about and especially not stephen's


---------11:00----------
friends


---------11:01----------
um so that really really sucked and i


---------11:04----------
felt like i


---------11:05----------
i just questioned like why did you do


---------11:07----------
that and


---------11:09----------
yeah this person can like change his


---------11:11----------
answers all the time and says that


---------11:13----------
he did it because he was worried about


---------11:15----------
me and that he wanted to vent to someone


---------11:16----------
else about my problems with someone so


---------11:18----------
he could help me


---------11:19----------
then he also said that the other person


---------11:20----------
was in the dark about everything was


---------11:22----------
worried about


---------11:22----------
that friend being stephen's friend and


---------11:25----------
then


---------11:26----------
or and also like that he just didn't


---------11:28----------
give a [ __ ] about me basically so


---------11:29----------
there's like a lot of different


---------11:30----------
um he said that he doesn't give a [ __ ]


---------11:32----------
about you yeah or that he


---------11:34----------
just it didn't really matter i don't


---------11:36----------
really see the problem with telling your


---------11:38----------
secrets to other people


---------11:39----------
like just like that and i don't see the


---------11:42----------
problem


---------11:42----------
he's just saying that he doesn't see the


---------11:43----------
problem in that so it's like okay


---------11:45----------
um so it sounds like you're getting a


---------11:48----------
lot of different answers


---------11:50----------
yeah yeah yeah for sure just so i


---------11:53----------
understand so it sounds like maybe it


---------11:54----------
was


---------11:54----------
hard for this person to sit with all of


---------11:57----------
the


---------11:58----------
emotional weight of what you were


---------11:59----------
confiding in him and he needed to


---------12:02----------
confide in someone else yeah but he's


---------12:04----------
also saying that he told this person


---------12:06----------
because he felt worried about her


---------12:09----------
for being stephen's friend because


---------12:10----------
stephen is a psychopath or whatever so


---------12:12----------
it's just like really


---------12:13----------
a lot of really really crazy stuff i


---------12:15----------
don't know a lot of work


---------12:19----------
i have so many questions about so much


---------12:21----------
about what you've said


---------12:25----------
the most shocking point is because you


---------12:26----------
know stephen is a psychopath


---------12:29----------
what does that mean like people are


---------12:32----------
people are always gonna think that just


---------12:33----------
because he doesn't


---------12:35----------
like cry on stream and like show a lot


---------12:37----------
of emotions and stuff like that and he


---------12:39----------
he talks very cold and stuff like that


---------12:41----------
people don't think actually even


---------12:43----------
is an emotional guy but she is but no


---------12:46----------
one really sees that and


---------12:48----------
sure people just treat him like [ __ ]


---------12:50----------
because of it


---------12:51----------
um and just doesn't give a [ __ ]


---------12:53----------
basically


---------12:54----------
but no none of these people really know


---------12:56----------
him um


---------12:58----------
but yeah but that's basically what


---------13:00----------
happened i felt


---------13:01----------
really really sad i felt really sad for


---------13:04----------
about two weeks after this happened


---------13:06----------
um until this guy bob convinced me that


---------13:10----------
yeah he wasn't


---------13:10----------
he didn't mean to and he wanted to keep


---------13:13----------
me as a friend and that he didn't want


---------13:14----------
me to cut him off and stuff like that


---------13:17----------
and then it went on with like two how


---------13:19----------
did you feel when he said that


---------13:23----------
um


---------13:28----------
he kind of showed like a different side


---------13:30----------
of himself a little bit


---------13:32----------
that's the thing like he always was like


---------13:34----------
what are you called like a joker he was


---------13:36----------
like almost like


---------13:36----------
he was always like joking around and


---------13:38----------
like he we never really


---------13:39----------
like that was the thing like why i like


---------13:41----------
talking to him was because he was very


---------13:43----------
neutral


---------13:43----------
and then he would like joke things away


---------13:45----------
a little bit instead of like making


---------13:47----------
it really serious and that would kind of


---------13:48----------
like make me see the humoring thing


---------13:50----------
it was really hard for me to talk to him


---------13:52----------
yeah but this time


---------13:54----------
he was like begging me to like not leave


---------13:56----------
him as a friend and that he really cared


---------13:58----------
about me you know he was like


---------14:00----------
and i've never heard him say anything


---------14:01----------
like that before so for me that felt


---------14:03----------
very genuine i guess or it took me


---------14:06----------
like it took a heart i don't know it


---------14:08----------
took it took a lot of it um


---------14:10----------
a lot of effort and a lot of like mental


---------14:12----------
effort and stuff to um


---------14:15----------
to get over that betrayal um


---------14:18----------
did you feel like you had to get over


---------14:20----------
that betrayal


---------14:22----------
yeah because this was my best friend


---------14:25----------
okay


---------14:28----------
i feel like i didn't have any any best


---------14:30----------
friends or anything


---------14:32----------
he didn't have any best friends not


---------14:35----------
not really not really like in this world


---------14:37----------
no like i moved away from


---------14:39----------
my friends and like i lived in sweden at


---------14:42----------
the time but a lot of my friends moved


---------14:44----------
away from stockholm


---------14:45----------
um and like i didn't really have a


---------14:48----------
friend that was like super available


---------14:50----------
i guess so like this was like a very


---------14:51----------
important person i just came back


---------14:53----------
to america and i don't really know


---------14:55----------
anyone in l.a either


---------14:57----------
you know and like i didn't have anyone


---------14:58----------
that was that available and that i


---------15:00----------
felt like i had that connection with i


---------15:02----------
don't even know if that connection was


---------15:04----------
real


---------15:04----------
that was the thing because he lied about


---------15:06----------
so many things


---------15:07----------
um what do you think about


---------15:12----------
he lied about like


---------15:15----------
let me think he um


---------15:18----------
everything kind of like turned out this


---------15:20----------
way was that there was like two months


---------15:22----------
of him


---------15:23----------
basically telling me how bad


---------15:24----------
relationship i was in


---------15:26----------
and stuff and i tried to like navigate


---------15:30----------
away from that but everything was really


---------15:32----------
hard because i felt like i didn't want


---------15:33----------
to lose him as a friend and i didn't


---------15:36----------
you know want to be disrespectful to


---------15:37----------
steven it was like everything was like


---------15:39----------
pretty crazy


---------15:40----------
and then like steven's friend that was a


---------15:42----------
close friend of his like didn't like me


---------15:44----------
at all and she's like hated me because


---------15:46----------
she saw that i she felt like i wasn't


---------15:49----------
respecting him


---------15:50----------
everything was like really insane um


---------15:54----------
he basically told a bunch of lies um


---------15:57----------
[Music]


---------15:58----------
and he uh it came out that he


---------16:02----------
talked also a so


---------16:05----------
like much behind my back like really


---------16:07----------
really badly


---------16:08----------
like a bunch of [ __ ] about my like about


---------16:10----------
me behind my back


---------16:12----------
and i've seen like logs of this as well


---------16:14----------
so like while this was all going on he


---------16:15----------
was [ __ ] talking


---------16:16----------
like crazy to a lot of people so i don't


---------16:19----------
think this person was like real


---------16:21----------
i think this person was i don't know i


---------16:23----------
have no idea like why


---------16:25----------
or how it sounds like you're really


---------16:26----------
confused about what to believe about


---------16:29----------
bob is it yeah yeah


---------16:32----------
so seems like really conflicting


---------16:37----------
yeah i i don't i have no idea i don't i


---------16:40----------
don't know i'm


---------16:42----------
i i think he i have no idea i don't know


---------16:45----------
maybe he kind of just like give up on me


---------16:47----------
or something but like letting like


---------16:49----------
everything like go on and stuff it was


---------16:51----------
like really everything was like really


---------16:53----------
crazy


---------16:54----------
i only found out about all this because


---------16:56----------
me and that person


---------16:57----------
or her name is bose she


---------17:00----------
seems friend she came to the same kind


---------17:03----------
of like convention kind of thing


---------17:06----------
yeah that's her name okay um


---------17:10----------
and i feel whenever i'm like around


---------17:12----------
people that i know has like a lot of


---------17:14----------
really


---------17:14----------
um bad opinions about me or there's like


---------17:17----------
a fight going on or something i never


---------17:18----------
spoke to this person really before i've


---------17:20----------
never been in real life


---------17:21----------
um i get really weird and i get really


---------17:24----------
uncomfortable


---------17:25----------
and i need to confront so what i did was


---------17:27----------
that i


---------17:28----------
in georgia confronted her and said hey i


---------17:30----------
know exactly everything you know like


---------17:32----------
you think about me


---------17:33----------
because i got a huge like log sent from


---------17:36----------
him the day before


---------17:37----------
we're actually through another person


---------17:39----------
yeah is everything is like really crazy


---------17:41----------
but yeah i got like


---------17:42----------
a lot of her saying a lot of really


---------17:44----------
really bad things about me and i


---------17:46----------
confronted her and then


---------17:47----------
during three hours we figured out that


---------17:49----------
he was full of [ __ ] basically


---------17:51----------
so she felt really betrayed as well so i


---------17:54----------
yeah this whole thing was like really


---------17:56----------
really insane and then


---------17:58----------
um why do you want to confront


---------18:02----------
i just can't walk around people knowing


---------18:05----------
that they


---------18:06----------
uh that they have like problems maybe i


---------18:08----------
can't do that i need to like confront


---------18:09----------
them and ask


---------18:10----------
why why um


---------18:14----------
i feel so bad it's better for me to


---------18:16----------
almost just like


---------18:18----------
do like just like confront them and like


---------18:20----------
know exactly what they


---------18:22----------
what they think about me i just want to


---------18:24----------
have a straight conversation


---------18:25----------
instead of like hearing a bunch of stuff


---------18:28----------
behind my back about what this person


---------18:29----------
thinks about me and like feel their


---------18:31----------
energy


---------18:31----------
i can't do that i need to like hey i


---------18:34----------
know what you think about me


---------18:35----------
let's talk about it like i need to do


---------18:36----------
that okay so it sounds like you can sort


---------18:38----------
of feel their


---------18:40----------
malice field of negative energy like


---------18:43----------
through rumors and dms and so and so


---------18:46----------
yeah you just need to cut through it and


---------18:49----------
and just okay yeah i just have to i just


---------18:52----------
have to do it and then when we did we


---------18:54----------
figured out


---------18:55----------
there was like a lot of things that was


---------18:57----------
pretty crazy and


---------18:58----------
um we can't what happened was basically


---------19:02----------
that


---------19:04----------
there was there was other people that


---------19:05----------
knew him as well and that knew me and


---------19:07----------
her


---------19:08----------
so we start talking to another person


---------19:10----------
about all this and that person told us


---------19:11----------
even more things that he said to them


---------19:14----------
and then we were like oh my god this


---------19:15----------
person is friends with this person as


---------19:16----------
well and i'm friends with this person


---------19:18----------
i'm gonna ask this person


---------19:19----------
and then it was just like a bunch of


---------19:21----------
people like figuring out like okay wait


---------19:23----------
this happened like


---------19:24----------
this is like all what's been said and


---------19:26----------
stuff like that


---------19:27----------
how did it feel to go through that


---------19:31----------
um kind of that investigation and


---------19:34----------
figuring things out and piecing things


---------19:36----------
together


---------19:38----------
at the time when that happened this is


---------19:40----------
really scary


---------19:42----------
what was scary i don't know it's like


---------19:43----------
really insane that like that all of that


---------19:45----------
happened that this was like a person


---------19:47----------
that i used to view in such a positive


---------19:48----------
way


---------19:50----------
and then we find out that there was like


---------19:53----------
a bunch of people that like that he


---------19:55----------
betrayed as well about like talking [ __ ]


---------19:57----------
behind their back and stuff and he did a


---------19:58----------
very


---------19:59----------
everything everything was pretty crazy


---------20:01----------
and then


---------20:02----------
um he kind of like already


---------20:06----------
went around to other people talking


---------20:08----------
really really badly about stephen as


---------20:09----------
well


---------20:10----------
and steven knew about this like three


---------20:12----------
months ago


---------20:13----------
like he figured out that this happened


---------20:15----------
like a long time ago


---------20:16----------
um especially with bose as well because


---------20:19----------
he talked


---------20:20----------
so much to her um so he was really


---------20:22----------
really pissed


---------20:23----------
and he felt like he didn't even know who


---------20:25----------
thought what about


---------20:26----------
anything anymore or like about him


---------20:29----------
because he was


---------20:30----------
running around saying so much stuff like


---------20:32----------
that wasn't true like lies


---------20:34----------
twisted truth it's like a lot of crazy


---------20:36----------
stuff


---------20:37----------
will you pause for just a second i'd


---------20:40----------
like to just collect my thoughts and try


---------20:42----------
to


---------20:43----------
i just need a moment yeah sure


---------20:58----------
this sounds like drama to me yeah it is


---------21:01----------
dramas it is


---------21:04----------
it's very dramatic i mean you told me to


---------21:07----------
explain the situation


---------21:08----------
so i'm explaining it yeah yeah yeah i i


---------21:11----------
appreciate that


---------21:12----------
i'm just just i'm struck by how


---------21:15----------
much there's this person talk to this


---------21:17----------
person and this person talk to this


---------21:18----------
person and this


---------21:19----------
like like that sounds [ __ ] exhausting


---------21:23----------
yeah i mean yeah i don't know i don't


---------21:25----------
even know what excel


---------21:26----------
like being calls it is anymore because


---------21:28----------
that's what i feel all the time


---------21:30----------
what's it like to be exhausted all the


---------21:32----------
time


---------21:41----------
that's hard to explain um


---------21:44----------
i feel like two years ago when i wasn't


---------21:47----------
streaming on twitch and i was like not


---------21:49----------
involved with all these people and stuff


---------21:51----------
and i had like my


---------21:53----------
my life in new zealand or in sweden and


---------21:55----------
stuff and everything was like very


---------21:57----------
normal i'd say


---------21:58----------
it was of course like stuff that


---------22:00----------
happened sometimes


---------22:01----------
but i felt like it was like very easy


---------22:03----------
for me to like


---------22:04----------
just disconnect thoughts and stuff and


---------22:07----------
just focus on certain things and


---------22:09----------
just relax and enjoy things it sounds


---------22:12----------
like it's really surrounding you


---------22:14----------
now like you can't escape from it yeah i


---------22:17----------
can't


---------22:18----------
and even if i try to like


---------22:21----------
um like go work out or go for a run or


---------22:25----------
go for a walk or


---------22:26----------
just like follows you around meditate i


---------22:29----------
can't


---------22:30----------
it doesn't work i can't do it it's like


---------22:32----------
all over


---------22:33----------
like all the time um and then it's like


---------22:36----------
everything like upon that as well


---------22:38----------
there's like


---------22:40----------
there's like the stress about streaming


---------22:42----------
and


---------22:43----------
the stress about staying in contact with


---------22:45----------
people the stress about


---------22:46----------
the relationships there's stress about


---------22:50----------
the world there's stress about um


---------22:53----------
like so many things you know and and


---------22:55----------
then i have all of these people this is


---------22:57----------
like


---------22:58----------
not just like this thing that happened


---------22:59----------
there's like other things that happens


---------23:01----------
around that as well


---------23:02----------
and there's people messaging me saying


---------23:05----------
that i am


---------23:06----------
like hurting them because i am not as


---------23:08----------
available as they want me to be


---------23:09----------
and stuff like that too and i just feel


---------23:11----------
like i can't sit and like respond to


---------23:13----------
messages


---------23:14----------
because it stresses me out so much and


---------23:16----------
then i hurt people because i'm not


---------23:18----------
giving them like what they feel like


---------23:20----------
they need out of me i guess


---------23:22----------
so i'm like very exhausted yeah


---------23:26----------
sounds like a lot of people


---------23:30----------
molina it feels to me like you're


---------23:31----------
getting sucked dry


---------23:34----------
yeah i mean i think this is something we


---------23:37----------
talked a little bit about


---------23:38----------
last time but yeah i just like i just


---------23:41----------
feel like


---------23:43----------
i'm absolutely going in the worst


---------23:44----------
direction possible at the moment i have


---------23:46----------
no idea how to like


---------23:47----------
control better what to do and tell me


---------23:50----------
about that direction you're going in


---------23:52----------
right now


---------23:52----------
what makes it so bad um


---------23:56----------
i'm just getting so hurt i'm getting so


---------24:00----------
hurt over and over again


---------24:01----------
and no one gives a [ __ ] that's what it


---------24:03----------
feels like like no one


---------24:04----------
no one of these people like understands


---------24:07----------
like i had another i had another friend


---------24:09----------
like betraying me pretty hardcore


---------24:12----------
by like really like telling me like you


---------24:15----------
could always come to me you could always


---------24:16----------
talk to me i would never do anything of


---------24:18----------
these things that you're so scared of


---------24:20----------
happening


---------24:20----------
and then this person did exactly the


---------24:22----------
thing that would would be the absolute


---------24:24----------
worst for them to do


---------24:26----------
what did they do i don't think it's well


---------24:28----------
i don't think


---------24:29----------
i shouldn't like okay


---------24:33----------
um but that really really sucks and then


---------24:36----------
like


---------24:37----------
that felt so bad that it just like i i


---------24:39----------
don't think this person ever cared about


---------24:41----------
me i think this person was just really


---------24:42----------
selfish and wanted me


---------24:44----------
to think certain ways about them for


---------24:45----------
them to make it easier to get something


---------24:47----------
else


---------24:49----------
and this person is like messaging me


---------24:51----------
trying to like


---------24:53----------
i don't know i don't know if they're


---------24:54----------
trying to like make me feel bad


---------24:56----------
about anything because they're still


---------24:58----------
like so like defensive


---------25:00----------
about what they did and they're they're


---------25:03----------
very like but what about me and i'm like


---------25:04----------
but i wasn't the one i've


---------25:06----------
like done everything for you like i've


---------25:07----------
done all the like the the best things


---------25:09----------
for you because i cared you know that's


---------25:11----------
what i felt


---------25:12----------
and then this person just like did this


---------25:14----------
just out of like


---------25:15----------
who takes care of you molina


---------25:18----------
sounds like you spend a lot of time


---------25:20----------
taking care of other people who takes


---------25:21----------
care of you


---------25:23----------
i think stephen king takes care of me


---------25:25----------
sometimes like


---------25:26----------
i don't think he really like takes care


---------25:28----------
i think he cares like whenever we have a


---------25:30----------
fight or something like that i think he


---------25:31----------
cares about solving it but i think it's


---------25:32----------
very hard for him


---------25:33----------
which is i understand like he's used the


---------25:35----------
way he is but i mean whenever


---------25:38----------
whenever i um like if i would be upset


---------25:41----------
about something like my mom or something


---------25:43----------
like that


---------25:44----------
um like he would always like take care


---------25:46----------
of me of course and like talk to me like


---------25:47----------
i was sad yesterday


---------25:49----------
because i just felt um


---------25:53----------
like all these things are like happening


---------25:55----------
to me and i wonder if i deserve it


---------25:58----------
because all of these like things are


---------26:00----------
happening and they're just


---------26:02----------
like if all of these people just decides


---------26:04----------
to do like really horrible things to me


---------26:05----------
that


---------26:06----------
must mean that it feels that way it


---------26:08----------
doesn't sound very good when i say but


---------26:09----------
it feels like i decided what does it


---------26:11----------
feel like


---------26:13----------
um and when they say no


---------26:18----------
i feel very small then like very weak


---------26:21----------
it sounds to me like you're kind of


---------26:23----------
getting taken advantage of


---------26:26----------
yeah but i think i think


---------26:30----------
i kind of like always felt that way i


---------26:32----------
think


---------26:33----------
it's just that there's more people


---------26:35----------
that's able to do that at the moment


---------26:38----------
maybe i feel like there's more people


---------26:40----------
that's doing


---------26:41----------
yeah it sounds like a lot of people are


---------26:44----------
the themes that i'm hearing or that


---------26:45----------
people betray your trust


---------26:47----------
people sort of don't look out for you


---------26:52----------
you know yeah


---------26:55----------
they rely on you for emotional support


---------26:59----------
like it feels like very one-way traffic


---------27:01----------
the way you're describing it


---------27:03----------
yeah um


---------27:08----------
i feel like it's always been like that a


---------27:09----------
lot it's like um


---------27:11----------
um like my mom is that way she's always


---------27:14----------
like


---------27:15----------
ever since i was a kid i've been her


---------27:17----------
like therapist since i was like seven


---------27:18----------
years old


---------27:19----------
i remember yeah and


---------27:23----------
i've always kind of like felt like i had


---------27:26----------
to like


---------27:27----------
yeah like step back a lot you know


---------27:32----------
and just like take everyone's stuff but


---------27:34----------
i don't


---------27:36----------
i don't understand it maybe i'm like not


---------27:38----------
showing enough that i just can't take


---------27:40----------
any more you know i don't know maybe


---------27:42----------
it's just so how let's


---------27:43----------
let's talk about so let's like pick one


---------27:45----------
particular case and maybe dig into it by


---------27:48----------
the way if you want to explain more


---------27:49----------
about


---------27:49----------
um you know what's happened with bob and


---------27:51----------
stuff recently i'm more than happy to


---------27:53----------
listen


---------27:55----------
um there was just so much significant


---------27:57----------
stuff i felt like i had to kind of pause


---------27:58----------
and


---------27:58----------
it's like a crazy story it's like a


---------28:00----------
movie it's like very


---------28:02----------
insane like a lot of like really pieces


---------28:06----------
and figuring things out and then the


---------28:08----------
picture changing


---------28:09----------
and yeah yeah a lot of and then like now


---------28:12----------
everything is like


---------28:14----------
really weird too because there's like


---------28:15----------
other streamers trying to like get us


---------28:18----------
be platformed because get us


---------28:21----------
get you de-platformed or yeah like


---------28:24----------
trying to like get us banned from twitch


---------28:26----------
like that's how crazy what's your


---------28:28----------
understanding of why


---------28:30----------
other people what have you done that's


---------28:31----------
worthy of being


---------28:33----------
banned from twitch in people's minds


---------28:36----------
um i have no idea i i have no idea why


---------28:39----------
they would want to try to do that i


---------28:40----------
think they probably just feel really bad


---------28:44----------
um i think they're really upset because


---------28:46----------
things turn out the way it did


---------28:48----------
and they kind of like rewarded someone


---------28:50----------
that they probably regret supporting


---------28:51----------
after what came out after that


---------28:54----------
but why would they try to get you banned


---------28:56----------
if they supported someone


---------28:58----------
who's probably because it feels good for


---------29:00----------
them


---------29:01----------
right it probably feels good if you


---------29:03----------
really hate someone or if you're really


---------29:05----------
upset with someone you probably wish to


---------29:06----------
worship for them at the moment right


---------29:09----------
so is there anything that that you can


---------29:12----------
think of that


---------29:13----------
you've done that would make someone


---------29:15----------
think


---------29:16----------
so hatred is one reason that you want


---------29:18----------
someone to be banned


---------29:20----------
is there anything like what do they say


---------29:22----------
like what's their complaint


---------29:24----------
as to why you should be banned


---------29:25----------
motivations aside


---------29:27----------
like to try to bring up stuff from the


---------29:29----------
past stuff like that and just like try


---------29:31----------
to like


---------29:32----------
yeah it's like a there's like one person


---------29:35----------
that is like making a big


---------29:36----------
document about having their fans like


---------29:38----------
trying to collect all the worst things


---------29:40----------
that me and stephen has ever done to try


---------29:41----------
to get us banned


---------29:43----------
wow that's how bad it is yeah


---------29:46----------
sounds like you're being hunted yeah


---------29:50----------
yeah and i i don't


---------29:54----------
it all i came from like something really


---------29:55----------
dumb about like one person not liking


---------29:57----------
the other person so with the defense so


---------29:59----------
this person defended bob because of it


---------30:02----------
um basically and then um


---------30:05----------
[Music]


---------30:06----------
yeah bob came out with like or first


---------30:09----------
stephen stephen went live and he


---------30:11----------
explained like the situation with


---------30:13----------
bob talking a bunch of [ __ ] about


---------30:15----------
stephen to other people and stuff


---------30:17----------
because he felt like he didn't really


---------30:18----------
stop


---------30:19----------
like bob did this to so many people that


---------30:21----------
he just felt like he had to make it


---------30:22----------
public


---------30:23----------
because there was no way first for bob


---------30:25----------
to stop doing this because it was people


---------30:26----------
that already started hating stephen


---------30:29----------
um and then after that bob just made


---------30:31----------
like a big


---------30:32----------
like what was it like 40 40 like pages


---------30:35----------
of just like [ __ ] and


---------30:37----------
leaks and just like crazy stuff to like


---------30:39----------
make us look as bad as possible and a


---------30:41----------
bunch of lies


---------30:42----------
and then steven made like a big one too


---------30:45----------
where he explained everything that


---------30:46----------
happened basically


---------30:48----------
um and one of the things that happened


---------30:50----------
was that um


---------30:52----------
bob sexually harassed another girl and


---------30:54----------
that came out in this one too


---------30:56----------
so after that came out this other person


---------30:59----------
which is casey john


---------31:00----------
tried to get us banned because she's


---------31:04----------
really upset because she took bob's side


---------31:06----------
on this so it's pretty so it's kind of


---------31:08----------
like a war


---------31:09----------
between yeah it sounds like a war like


---------31:13----------
people that are like


---------31:14----------
it reminds me of like like i don't


---------31:19----------
like it's like really insane like it's


---------31:21----------
just like it's a great question


---------31:22----------
i mean this reminds me of like studying


---------31:25----------
european history you know when like


---------31:27----------
france and spain start to fight and then


---------31:29----------
england is like we're on spain side


---------31:31----------
because [ __ ] france and then germany's


---------31:32----------
like oh my god


---------31:34----------
we better join france aside and then


---------31:36----------
like you have this whole balance of


---------31:37----------
power thing where like different people


---------31:38----------
are like making documents and supporting


---------31:40----------
each other and like


---------31:41----------
yeah it's like really insane yeah i


---------31:43----------
don't know i'm just like


---------31:45----------
i just i here's the thing


---------31:48----------
what kind of person i am i just want to


---------31:50----------
like have a cabin


---------31:51----------
in nature just chill do my thing


---------31:55----------
make art and do shrooms that's what i


---------31:58----------
want to do i just want to chill i don't


---------31:59----------
want that


---------32:00----------
like that was my life before this like i


---------32:02----------
just like


---------32:03----------
liked being very present and stuff


---------32:06----------
what what do you like about streaming


---------32:09----------
like it's weird right because it's like


---------32:11----------
i want a cabin out in the woods i want


---------32:12----------
to just be by myself and stream


---------32:14----------
you can just toss that in there gaming


---------32:17----------
is nice if i can like spend time with my


---------32:19----------
community and i can travel around and i


---------32:21----------
can show them


---------32:22----------
the beauty of the world that's why i


---------32:23----------
like doing because i think the world is


---------32:24----------
beautiful


---------32:25----------
yeah if i can do that it makes me happy


---------32:28----------
you know


---------32:28----------
but how do you get into all this


---------32:32----------
um i mean i became friends with bob


---------32:36----------
right that's how it started


---------32:38----------
so i think oddly enough so melina we've


---------32:40----------
got a couple of different options okay


---------32:43----------
one is that you know if you feel like it


---------32:45----------
would be helpful to you


---------32:46----------
or helpful for us to understand i'm


---------32:48----------
happy to hear more of the play-by-plays


---------32:50----------
about who said what and who did what


---------32:52----------
if you think that kind of thing is


---------32:53----------
helpful generally speaking i i don't


---------32:55----------
know that i'm really that good at


---------32:58----------
no i don't think it's necessary either


---------32:59----------
okay


---------33:01----------
it's more about the um that


---------33:04----------
right now i just feel like there's been


---------33:06----------
like so many things


---------33:08----------
that i just feel like i don't think i'm


---------33:11----------
gonna be the same person in a year you


---------33:12----------
know


---------33:13----------
i think i'm just gonna be at the worst


---------33:14----------
version of myself possible very soon


---------33:19----------
okay so let me offer a couple of


---------33:23----------
different directions and then you let me


---------33:25----------
know so i think the


---------33:25----------
the term divorced version of yourself


---------33:29----------
that sounds actually let me just forget


---------33:30----------
about what i was going to


---------33:31----------
tell you what that means version the


---------33:33----------
worst or divorce


---------33:35----------
the worst okay


---------33:38----------
what help me understand that why do you


---------33:40----------
think you're gonna be the worst version


---------33:42----------
of yourself a year from now


---------33:44----------
um because i just feel like


---------33:47----------
i don't think i've


---------33:52----------
i don't think okay so i don't think i've


---------33:55----------
cried


---------33:55----------
as much and like felt so much anxiety


---------34:00----------
this past year or like last year than


---------34:03----------
i've ever


---------34:03----------
like felt my entire life almost maybe


---------34:05----------
like when i was a kid or something but i


---------34:07----------
don't remember that exactly


---------34:09----------
um and i remember when i was


---------34:12----------
living in a van and i was traveling


---------34:14----------
around and i was in nature i think


---------34:16----------
during six months i had one bad day


---------34:21----------
yeah and i feel like i always like


---------34:24----------
every single day i get back to like a


---------34:27----------
dark place


---------34:28----------
every single day and what brings you


---------34:32----------
back to that dark place


---------34:35----------
it kind of just hits from out of nowhere


---------34:40----------
or something i don't know like it from i


---------34:42----------
don't know where it just hits


---------34:44----------
and that sounds good terrible i mean


---------34:47----------
sometimes when i think about going to a


---------34:49----------
dark place i think like if it's


---------34:50----------
triggered by something at least you have


---------34:52----------
some sense of like


---------34:53----------
control or preparation


---------34:56----------
but if it just kind of randomly like it


---------34:58----------
sounds like it haunts you


---------35:00----------
right like i think like it like follows


---------35:02----------
you around


---------35:04----------
yeah i think it's like always there i


---------35:06----------
guess


---------35:08----------
yeah it's it's really hard to like live


---------35:11----------
here


---------35:11----------
and just like stream and just like do


---------35:13----------
the same thing like every single day and


---------35:15----------
then


---------35:16----------
um like that can like happen during


---------35:18----------
stream too so that really sucks as well


---------35:20----------
and then i feel really really sad and i


---------35:22----------
feel like it can't deliver or like i can


---------35:23----------
function


---------35:26----------
what is it that haunts you


---------35:30----------
um just like


---------35:34----------
i just feel like i'm uh


---------35:39----------
i don't know i i'm trying to think if i


---------35:40----------
care about these people that hurt me


---------35:42----------
like if i care about their opinions


---------35:45----------
i don't know maybe i do a little i mean


---------35:48----------
i just feel like so weak and hurt and


---------35:50----------
just like


---------35:52----------
i feel like i don't like deserve to like


---------35:56----------
take care of myself


---------35:59----------
maybe like that's what it feels like so


---------36:03----------
i just like don't really see the purpose


---------36:04----------
of like


---------36:06----------
doing anything good for myself or like


---------36:08----------
to stream


---------36:10----------
or to like eat or like try to work out


---------36:14----------
or anything like that i just like


---------36:16----------
lose motivation


---------36:21----------
how long have you felt like you don't


---------36:23----------
deserve to take care of yourself


---------36:28----------
i think it comes and goes but i think


---------36:30----------
this time period right now has been the


---------36:32----------
longest one and that has probably


---------36:34----------
it's probably been like going like


---------36:37----------
growing


---------36:38----------
but always been there but like growing


---------36:39----------
for maybe like three months


---------36:44----------
okay


---------36:47----------
so molina this may be a little bit so


---------36:49----------
one thing i want to kind of offer you is


---------36:51----------
um so a lot of times we talk about


---------36:54----------
feelings


---------36:55----------
but i think uh today i'm hearing that


---------36:57----------
there may be a couple things that may


---------36:59----------
apply may not apply but i could actually


---------37:01----------
sort of like


---------37:02----------
try to explain a few concepts or even


---------37:04----------
make a couple of recommendations


---------37:06----------
in your case now the challenge is that


---------37:09----------
you know if i jump into that now there's


---------37:10----------
a decent chance some of that stuff is


---------37:12----------
actually like


---------37:13----------
wrong like it doesn't apply to you um


---------37:16----------
and the more we talk i think the more


---------37:18----------
you know


---------37:21----------
the sort of educational principles are


---------37:23----------
gonna apply to you but i already have


---------37:25----------
some


---------37:25----------
kind of ideas about stuff um


---------37:29----------
so do you think we should explore


---------37:30----------
further or do you wanna try to


---------37:32----------
like maybe start to formulate a plan is


---------37:35----------
to like how to tackle this


---------37:38----------
um we can explore further okay


---------37:41----------
yeah um


---------37:47----------
so tell me understand what is the worst


---------37:49----------
version of yourself what


---------37:51----------
how is that person different from where


---------37:53----------
you are now


---------37:56----------
what will you become that you don't want


---------37:58----------
to be


---------38:04----------
i feel like when i'm happy i'm shining a


---------38:06----------
lot


---------38:08----------
um and i see a smile does really


---------38:11----------
light up your face it's like it's like


---------38:13----------
magic yeah


---------38:14----------
yeah um so i just feel like and that's


---------38:17----------
like how i


---------38:18----------
um like express myself i guess like


---------38:21----------
being happy i guess and


---------38:23----------
yeah um i think i let myself feel things


---------38:26----------
which is good like i'm pretty excited


---------38:28----------
like i'm accepting my own feelings a lot


---------38:30----------
i think


---------38:31----------
um but i feel like i can't like deliver


---------38:37----------
like what i do i guess or like how i


---------38:40----------
how i am um


---------38:41----------
[Music]


---------38:43----------
and it sounds like something's getting


---------38:44----------
in the way of you being you


---------38:46----------
yeah exactly it does it feels like


---------38:48----------
that's taking away from me you know


---------38:50----------
and um i also feel like um


---------38:56----------
like instead of like seeing like the


---------38:58----------
positive things and like feeling happy


---------39:00----------
and excited and just like laughing and


---------39:03----------
being excited to like do things and


---------39:05----------
stuff like that i just feel like i'm


---------39:07----------
like becoming very hateful


---------39:09----------
and i feel like i see the worst in


---------39:10----------
people even if they haven't even done


---------39:12----------
anything to me yet or anything


---------39:14----------
i just like expect the worst i feel like


---------39:16----------
i can't trust anyone i feel like i'm


---------39:18----------
becoming more lonely


---------39:20----------
um i feel like i feel less too


---------39:23----------
i feel like it's hard for me to like


---------39:26----------
express


---------39:26----------
my feelings true i'm i'm almost hearing


---------39:30----------
like


---------39:30----------
almost like a defense of numbness


---------39:35----------
um yeah i'm becoming like more maybe


---------39:39----------
like i don't even know if it's like


---------39:40----------
angry it's just hateful i guess


---------39:42----------
and i just feel like the the way that i


---------39:44----------
am is like gone almost


---------39:46----------
oh it's go it's going to be gone soon


---------39:49----------
gonna be


---------39:49----------
destroyed by hatred you're gonna become


---------39:51----------
you're gonna become a sith lord


---------39:55----------
i don't know i just i just feel like i'm


---------39:57----------
like dying


---------39:58----------
that's what it feels like yeah tell me


---------40:00----------
about the hatred


---------40:03----------
um no just it's just like a


---------40:07----------
feeling that's there it's just growing


---------40:09----------
just there and


---------40:10----------
whatever um


---------40:20----------
it's like everything it's


---------40:23----------
it's like everything i don't know like


---------40:25----------
it it's it it


---------40:27----------
it's it's not like i hate like specific


---------40:29----------
things it feels like it's just a hate


---------40:30----------
filter that comes on and then i just see


---------40:33----------
everything that way


---------40:34----------
you know yeah so what are some one


---------40:36----------
filter i have like this


---------40:37----------
like dark like hate filter on yeah so i


---------40:40----------
can see how having the hate filter


---------40:42----------
instead of the love filter is the worst


---------40:44----------
version of you yeah that you kind of


---------40:47----------
view yourself as someone


---------40:48----------
i mean do you think you have a love


---------40:50----------
filter on and the best version of you


---------40:53----------
yeah okay


---------40:57----------
like love and happiness and just like um


---------41:01----------
it's so hard to like explain i feel like


---------41:03----------
i've um hmm


---------41:07----------
this is like really weird but when i


---------41:08----------
when i used to do like a lot of


---------41:10----------
psychedelics and stuff


---------41:11----------
i felt like i had like a lot of love


---------41:13----------
filter


---------41:14----------
um because you kind of like just like


---------41:17----------
love and accept


---------41:18----------
everything that's the thing like no


---------41:20----------
matter if it's bad or whatever


---------41:22----------
you see everything is as it is and you


---------41:24----------
decide to just see it in a good way


---------41:26----------
because that's like the


---------41:27----------
yeah it just it just kind of sucks when


---------41:29----------
it's like almost impossible to feel that


---------41:32----------
way because like


---------41:33----------
all of this is like happening and you


---------41:34----------
can't really control yourself and this


---------41:35----------
is all just like growing


---------41:37----------
i don't know i don't even know if that


---------41:39----------
makes sense yeah i think it makes a lot


---------41:41----------
of sense i have a weird question for you


---------41:43----------
can you have a love filter on when you


---------41:48----------
look at your hate filter can you love


---------41:51----------
your hate filter


---------41:53----------
um maybe this is


---------41:56----------
this this makes me think about um um


---------42:00----------
there's like a picture of a person


---------42:02----------
looking at a field with flowers


---------42:04----------
and then there's another person that is


---------42:06----------
like


---------42:07----------
on books and then that person sees like


---------42:11----------
that behind


---------42:12----------
um or oh this is like a fake picture


---------42:15----------
this is


---------42:16----------
actually just like a screen and then


---------42:17----------
behind that the world is trash


---------42:20----------
and then like then there's like another


---------42:22----------
person that is stepping on more books


---------42:23----------
or like on books and see that that is


---------42:26----------
also a screen


---------42:27----------
and that the universe is like beautiful


---------42:30----------
basically because that person is so high


---------42:31----------
up but it seems to be


---------42:32----------
like the beautiful of the universe kind


---------42:34----------
of thing it sounds like that a little


---------42:35----------
bit


---------42:35----------
yeah that's a great analogy yeah


---------42:40----------
but that has to do with knowledge or


---------42:42----------
whatever but yeah


---------42:44----------
um i thought about that i did like um


---------42:48----------
i did how much most i think is like 7.5


---------42:53----------
grams of mushrooms a year ago


---------42:54----------
which was not really that was an


---------42:56----------
accident that was pretty crazy


---------42:58----------
is that all right huh is that a lot


---------43:01----------
is that crazy yeah like you're you're


---------43:04----------
gone


---------43:05----------
it's like you're somewhere else um i can


---------43:07----------
handle those sort of moments where it's


---------43:09----------
like really stressful or like really


---------43:10----------
insane like pretty well but i remember i


---------43:12----------
thought about that a lot that


---------43:14----------
um that it everything felt really


---------43:18----------
uncomfortable


---------43:19----------
because it's like really intense but it


---------43:21----------
all depends like


---------43:22----------
if i if i kind of like just accepted


---------43:25----------
that and just thought


---------43:26----------
about the world trying to like show me


---------43:28----------
an experience


---------43:29----------
and why wouldn't i try to like see that


---------43:31----------
as a positive thing even though it was


---------43:32----------
really uncomfortable and just like try


---------43:34----------
to love that feeling instead


---------43:36----------
kind of i don't know so it makes me can


---------43:39----------
i ask you a little bit more about the


---------43:40----------
hatred


---------43:44----------
um


---------43:47----------
from people or or from know what you


---------43:50----------
feel


---------43:51----------
about hate yeah like like so i asked you


---------43:54----------
like


---------43:55----------
you know what do you hate and you said


---------43:57----------
it's like a filter


---------43:58----------
and i hate everything can you give me


---------44:00----------
some examples of like what are some of


---------44:02----------
the things that you hate


---------44:05----------
um certain people


---------44:08----------
particular people yeah


---------44:11----------
what about other people like


---------44:14----------
your community yourself stephen your


---------44:17----------
family


---------44:18----------
do you hate them too or is it just


---------44:21----------
particular people


---------44:24----------
maybe it's like particular people it's


---------44:26----------
just that i can't like


---------44:27----------
it's hard for me just because my trust


---------44:29----------
has been broken


---------44:30----------
it's very hard for me to see people like


---------44:32----------
that hasn't done anything to me in a


---------44:34----------
good way too


---------44:35----------
because i'm just waiting for them to


---------44:36----------
betray me too


---------44:38----------
right so it's like oh that sounds like


---------44:41----------
trauma


---------44:42----------
yeah yeah yeah


---------44:48----------
um


---------44:50----------
so it doesn't sound like you actually so


---------44:51----------
i guess the the hate filter that you're


---------44:53----------
referring to is sort of


---------44:55----------
waiting for other people to betray you


---------44:57----------
but that


---------44:58----------
actually when it comes down to your


---------44:59----------
hatred you actually just


---------45:02----------
feel hatred towards a few people


---------45:05----------
probably but it's also just that i i


---------45:08----------
don't know i can feel hate towards


---------45:09----------
people that i don't know


---------45:12----------
can you give me an example of that um


---------45:16----------
like if there's a person that messaged


---------45:18----------
me and i can tell like


---------45:20----------
my first instinct is like they want


---------45:22----------
something you know


---------45:24----------
they want something and these this


---------45:25----------
person is [ __ ]


---------45:27----------
this person doesn't give a [ __ ] about me


---------45:28----------
or about it and what would the message


---------45:31----------
say can you give us an example it could


---------45:34----------
be


---------45:34----------
someone just like reaching out checking


---------45:36----------
on how i'm doing


---------45:37----------
it could be anything that's the thing


---------45:39----------
but i'm just like like this person wants


---------45:41----------
something


---------45:42----------
like this person doesn't give a [ __ ]


---------45:43----------
this person doesn't know me


---------45:45----------
this person has no idea what's going on


---------45:47----------
and then when did you get


---------45:48----------
no when did you start to feel like


---------45:51----------
when did that hate filter come get put


---------45:54----------
on


---------45:56----------
when did you start to have those kinds


---------45:57----------
of thoughts about other people


---------45:59----------
um i think it's been slowly growing


---------46:02----------
since a year ago maybe


---------46:03----------
but like right now it's really really


---------46:04----------
bad um


---------46:09----------
i think like the mo like when it really


---------46:11----------
really happened was probably like


---------46:12----------
october or november i think it became


---------46:14----------
even worse for sure


---------46:18----------
um because there's always like


---------46:21----------
small things happening and then like


---------46:24----------
one like big thing happens and then like


---------46:26----------
small things happens and then like one


---------46:28----------
big one like goes like that and what how


---------46:30----------
do you change when those things happen


---------46:34----------
um


---------46:38----------
first i think i get like really hurt and


---------46:39----------
really shocked


---------46:41----------
and then i think i get pretty sad and


---------46:43----------
then i get pretty angry


---------46:46----------
and then i think it's just like


---------46:48----------
something has changed within me


---------46:50----------
but i i think i'm like i don't give a


---------46:52----------
[ __ ] like i think i'm like that


---------46:55----------
but i think i do but it's just so deep


---------46:58----------
that i can't really see like the the


---------47:01----------
details of it anymore like it


---------47:03----------
when it happened i saw details of it but


---------47:04----------
then it's like like another weight


---------47:07----------
like on me i guess yeah it's a very


---------47:09----------
insightful way of thinking about it


---------47:12----------
what do you think it is that's very deep


---------47:13----------
like like


---------47:15----------
can you give me any information about


---------47:18----------
what is that thing


---------47:20----------
the the like the heavy weights like um


---------47:23----------
just feeling


---------47:29----------
but that's like the thing like that


---------47:30----------
comes like from it's like so deep and


---------47:32----------
then


---------47:33----------
it feels like it just comes i don't know


---------47:35----------
how to say it um


---------47:38----------
it's hard i don't know do you feel like


---------47:40----------
it's dormant


---------47:41----------
and then it wakes up at times and then


---------47:44----------
it goes back to sleep


---------47:46----------
um yeah sure a little bit like that yeah


---------47:50----------
i guess so


---------47:52----------
but like when something happens it feels


---------47:54----------
like everything like comes up again a


---------47:55----------
little bit


---------47:56----------
yeah yeah that's how it works yeah


---------48:00----------
um


---------48:05----------
so molina can i share some thoughts with


---------48:07----------
you


---------48:14----------
so first of all i want to say i don't


---------48:15----------
think any of this is your fault


---------48:18----------
i don't know if you you know blame


---------48:20----------
yourself for it i d


---------48:22----------
do i think you have some degree of


---------48:24----------
agency or control over your situation


---------48:26----------
absolutely


---------48:28----------
but i i i would encourage you to do your


---------48:31----------
best


---------48:32----------
to not


---------48:35----------
blame yourself but also like strike a


---------48:38----------
balance between accepting that you made


---------48:39----------
a mistake


---------48:40----------
because i think you may have made


---------48:41----------
mistakes but also like forgiving


---------48:43----------
yourself for making that mistake


---------48:46----------
which is actually a little bit tricky so


---------48:47----------
a lot of times we will be like


---------48:49----------
that was wrong and therefore i'm a piece


---------48:51----------
of [ __ ] or


---------48:53----------
nothing was wrong and i'm totally fine


---------48:55----------
the truth is that


---------48:56----------
it was wrong and you aren't a piece of


---------48:59----------
[ __ ] it's just


---------49:00----------
you know we're human beings we learn so


---------49:04----------
here's


---------49:04----------
what i kind of hear from you so you're


---------49:06----------
like kind of an open and happy person by


---------49:08----------
nature you're like


---------49:09----------
i'ma get in a van and drive around new


---------49:11----------
zealand and do some shrooms and meet


---------49:13----------
people and have fun and like engage with


---------49:15----------
people and like


---------49:16----------
appreciate what life has to offer and


---------49:19----------
listen to the sound of a mountain stream


---------49:21----------
and


---------49:21----------
and watch a sunset and like you know


---------49:24----------
engage with a community and have some


---------49:25----------
fun like that's really who you are


---------49:29----------
and then people take advantage of your


---------49:30----------
openness um so i think that you do let


---------49:33----------
people in and i think


---------49:34----------
probably this is where like um you know


---------49:37----------
learning some about like setting


---------49:38----------
boundaries because it sounds like what's


---------49:40----------
happening is you let people


---------49:42----------
kind of like deep in and then they like


---------49:47----------
betray you right and i think there's


---------49:50----------
there's probably something around the


---------49:52----------
kind of person


---------49:53----------
that you attract so that like you are so


---------49:57----------
open and you are so bright


---------50:00----------
and you have this like they adjust which


---------50:02----------
i think we may have talked about last


---------50:03----------
time i'm sort of starting to remember


---------50:05----------
but that you have this sort of like


---------50:06----------
energy about you that like


---------50:08----------
brings sort of like the hungry lonely


---------50:12----------
people from the internet


---------50:14----------
and they see molina as shiny and they're


---------50:16----------
like ooh i want something


---------50:19----------
right and and then i think that things


---------50:21----------
get into like this is where things get


---------50:23----------
kind of tricky because i think that you


---------50:24----------
actually have needs there too which you


---------50:26----------
may not realize


---------50:28----------
which is that like i think you probably


---------50:30----------
get a lot of benefit


---------50:32----------
from being that person for other people


---------50:36----------
and so you guys enter into these


---------50:37----------
relationships where you guys are like


---------50:39----------
offering a lot of like emotional support


---------50:42----------
but it may be a little bit unclear about


---------50:44----------
like what


---------50:46----------
the foundation of that relationship is


---------50:48----------
so i think there's like a mutual


---------50:50----------
friendship where people can support each


---------50:52----------
other but i see this a lot


---------50:54----------
in in streamer communities especially


---------50:56----------
where


---------50:57----------
you know things get really tangled


---------50:58----------
especially when two people are streamers


---------51:00----------
because then there's like


---------51:01----------
numbers involved and this person is


---------51:03----------
growing bigger than i am and this person


---------51:04----------
is doing this and this person is doing


---------51:06----------
that


---------51:07----------
and and so there's a lot of like genuine


---------51:08----------
friendship there's a lot of genuine


---------51:10----------
goodness there's a lot of genuine caring


---------51:11----------
that then gets like polluted by these


---------51:13----------
other things


---------51:15----------
but one thing that i would really


---------51:17----------
encourage you to think a little bit


---------51:18----------
about is like for the people who do


---------51:20----------
betray you what did the start of your


---------51:22----------
relationship look like


---------51:23----------
and if you want to talk more i think


---------51:25----------
that's where we should explore


---------51:27----------
because i would guess um and that's just


---------51:30----------
a guess right so this could be


---------51:31----------
completely off


---------51:32----------
is that like there's something about the


---------51:34----------
way that that relationship starts


---------51:36----------
where either you're kind of like this is


---------51:39----------
where we put our psychoanalysts sort of


---------51:41----------
hat on you can go see a psychoanalyst


---------51:42----------
about this if you want to i don't really


---------51:44----------
understand this stuff


---------51:44----------
but are you playing out some kind of


---------51:47----------
thing with your mom


---------51:49----------
or or like is this the kind of thing


---------51:51----------
like because so sometimes we


---------51:52----------
as human beings willingly enter


---------51:56----------
familiar familiar but painful situation


---------52:00----------
and this goes back to that that patient


---------52:02----------
that i was working with who


---------52:04----------
sort of like like any time like a woman


---------52:06----------
treats him with like respect early on he


---------52:08----------
gets like kind of confused


---------52:11----------
but when he meets a woman who sort of


---------52:12----------
like devalues him and then he in turn


---------52:15----------
devalues her he's a toxic and abusive


---------52:18----------
too it's just like


---------52:18----------
it goes both ways and so they kind of


---------52:21----------
fall into this pattern and and i think


---------52:22----------
in his case it's really about


---------52:24----------
it was really confusing for him and we


---------52:26----------
worked through like


---------52:27----------
that initial relationship that initial


---------52:31----------
interaction


---------52:32----------
where like he starts to pull away so


---------52:34----------
what i'd be really curious about is for


---------52:36----------
bob


---------52:38----------
you know how did y'all's relationship


---------52:40----------
start


---------52:41----------
um and kind of exploring that because i


---------52:44----------
think you'll find a lot of answers there


---------52:46----------
i think the other things to think a


---------52:48----------
little bit about are


---------52:50----------
you know i i do think that it seems like


---------52:52----------
you evoke complicated feelings in people


---------52:55----------
so my sense just hearing you know what


---------52:57----------
you said about bob is not that he's like


---------53:00----------
i mean maybe he's two-faced and


---------53:01----------
untrustworthy and whatever i have no


---------53:02----------
idea


---------53:03----------
but it sounds to me like when he was


---------53:05----------
giving you lots of reasons like i don't


---------53:07----------
think he's like


---------53:08----------
lying about five of them and one of them


---------53:10----------
is real i think they're all


---------53:12----------
real and contradictory which is why it's


---------53:15----------
so confusing for him


---------53:16----------
and like so confusing for you


---------53:19----------
because it probably may have been i mean


---------53:22----------
it could have been a lot for him to sit


---------53:24----------
with all of your


---------53:25----------
emotional weight he made it neat have


---------53:27----------
needed to decompress


---------53:29----------
and then he may be devaluing you in


---------53:32----------
terms of how much that hurt you so he


---------53:33----------
may say like oh it's not that big of a


---------53:35----------
deal i don't understand why you're bent


---------53:36----------
out of shape


---------53:37----------
and the reason he does that is because


---------53:39----------
he actually does care about you


---------53:41----------
and the thought that he did something


---------53:43----------
that hurts you


---------53:45----------
hurts him so much that he has to like


---------53:47----------
pretend it didn't happen


---------53:49----------
which doesn't mean that he doesn't care


---------53:51----------
about you in fact it sort of means the


---------53:52----------
opposite does that make sense


---------53:55----------
he can't tolerate the idea this is just


---------53:57----------
a hypothesis


---------53:58----------
we've never met the guy but it may be


---------54:00----------
possible that he can't tolerate the idea


---------54:02----------
and he knows exactly


---------54:04----------
that what he did was wrong and really


---------54:06----------
hurtful and he cares about you


---------54:08----------
so he's like let's pretend it didn't


---------54:10----------
happen can we just move on


---------54:12----------
and it sort of makes sense to me that


---------54:13----------
he's huh


---------54:16----------
do you think it's like that with


---------54:17----------
everyone almost that's done something


---------54:19----------
like that


---------54:21----------
i think that


---------54:25----------
let me say this is that true for


---------54:27----------
everyone i don't know but i will say


---------54:28----------
this


---------54:29----------
that


---------54:34----------
the easiest pain for one human being to


---------54:37----------
ignore


---------54:38----------
is the pain that they cause to someone


---------54:41----------
who they care about


---------54:45----------
so the biggest deniers of me hurting you


---------54:49----------
are parents towards their children if


---------54:52----------
you want to see


---------54:53----------
really really really strong deny denial


---------54:57----------
talk to a parent about how they hurt


---------54:58----------
their children


---------55:01----------
and you'll see the strongest denial in


---------55:03----------
the world so in my history as a


---------55:05----------
psychiatrist that is


---------55:06----------
and the more you care the more you deny


---------55:09----------
because like if you care about someone


---------55:12----------
and i really really hurt you like holy


---------55:14----------
[ __ ] it means i don't care about you


---------55:16----------
and that is so cognitively dissonant


---------55:20----------
and difficult for someone to sit with


---------55:22----------
that it really causes all kinds of


---------55:24----------
problems and i think it sounds like you


---------55:25----------
guys are sort of in the situation where


---------55:28----------
he can't admit what he did to you so you


---------55:31----------
guys can't move past it


---------55:33----------
and this is where i think a big part of


---------55:35----------
like moving past things


---------55:37----------
is actually admitting that hurt happened


---------55:40----------
right and then you can really forgive


---------55:41----------
people but like unless there was no real


---------55:44----------
if there's no crime then there's no


---------55:46----------
mercy right like um yeah


---------55:50----------
sure i mean it sounds like it


---------55:54----------
in this case i mean i would say in terms


---------55:56----------
of everyone so it also doesn't sound


---------55:57----------
like everyone betrayed you it sounds


---------55:59----------
like there are a lot of people in your


---------56:00----------
life that don't betray you


---------56:03----------
but it feels like everyone betrayed you


---------56:06----------
yeah i think it's like an unbelievable


---------56:09----------
like amount of people that's like doing


---------56:10----------
something


---------56:11----------
what percentage of people that you


---------56:13----------
regularly interact with would you say


---------56:15----------
have betrayed you


---------56:18----------
probably like 70 80 percent and what tot


---------56:21----------
what's the total pool of people like are


---------56:22----------
we talking five people 10 people 20


---------56:24----------
people


---------56:24----------
50 people maybe like 50


---------56:28----------
20 30 something so that's a shockingly


---------56:32----------
high number


---------56:33----------
yeah that's what if that's


---------56:36----------
yeah it's just that like a lot of


---------56:42----------
i don't know it's like it's not just


---------56:44----------
like only people that i like know


---------56:46----------
really really like well and deep and


---------56:48----------
that's like that i'm friends with for a


---------56:49----------
very long time it's also like people


---------56:51----------
that


---------56:53----------
that i know about and knows about me and


---------56:55----------
that i've met and then they decide to do


---------56:57----------
something


---------56:58----------
a little like that's what it feels like


---------56:59----------
and then i think can you give me an


---------57:00----------
example of someone who you


---------57:02----------
know and who you met who did something


---------57:04----------
to you


---------57:06----------
um like like a name


---------57:11----------
no just like like an example of what


---------57:13----------
they did that you felt was betrayal


---------57:16----------
um like


---------57:23----------
you're saying like [ __ ] talking behind


---------57:25----------
my back and stuff like that hearing that


---------57:26----------
that person said things about me but how


---------57:29----------
do you hear that


---------57:31----------
um because i hear other people say it


---------57:34----------
and then i confront them about it


---------57:36----------
and then they say oh this person told me


---------57:38----------
yeah or i've heard they say


---------57:40----------
something on stream or something like


---------57:41----------
that yeah yeah so that sounds to me like


---------57:44----------
you may have a betrayal filter


---------57:46----------
right so when 80 of people in your life


---------57:48----------
betray you there are a couple of


---------57:49----------
different reasons for that one is that


---------57:51----------
you have a tendency to attract scumbags


---------57:53----------
which is very possible given light


---------57:55----------
radiance etc


---------57:58----------
second option is that you may have a


---------57:59----------
betrayal filter so this we see a lot


---------58:01----------
where like people


---------58:02----------
you know they when they start to feel


---------58:05----------
like they've been betrayed


---------58:07----------
their mind will go and hunt other


---------58:09----------
experiences that sort of fit into their


---------58:11----------
model


---------58:12----------
and another kind of random example that


---------58:14----------
may feel like it's pretty far is like in


---------58:16----------
cells are a good example of this


---------58:19----------
so they're kind of like convinced


---------58:22----------
that they're like unattractive and so


---------58:25----------
every time that someone does something


---------58:27----------
that suggests that they're


---------58:29----------
attractive they kind of ignore it and


---------58:32----------
every time there's like even like


---------58:33----------
something that's in the gray area they


---------58:35----------
their mind sort of finds that as


---------58:37----------
evidence


---------58:39----------
and this we see a lot when people have


---------58:42----------
um a lot of emotional hurt


---------58:43----------
right so we know that like when i'm


---------58:45----------
hurting


---------58:46----------
things become more painful so people


---------58:50----------
who have depression literally experience


---------58:53----------
more pain from the same stimulus than


---------58:56----------
someone who's like mentally feeling well


---------58:59----------
so you can deliver like the same shock


---------59:01----------
or like whatever benign like slightly


---------59:03----------
painful thing


---------59:04----------
and it like hurts more when people are


---------59:06----------
depressed


---------59:07----------
that could be a piece of it i don't know


---------59:10----------
how that makes you feel though because i


---------59:12----------
imagine it's quite invalidating


---------59:14----------
what does that word mean invalidating


---------59:17----------
like it's like i'm saying


---------59:18----------
oh it's all in your head i'm afraid of


---------59:19----------
coming across like that


---------59:22----------
no i think that's okay okay


---------59:25----------
i mean it does sound like a shocking


---------59:27----------
amount of people


---------59:28----------
have you know yeah betrayed tradies


---------59:31----------
especially the past two years


---------59:33----------
and especially the past six months or


---------59:35----------
five months something yeah


---------59:37----------
what do you think do you think something


---------59:39----------
has happened that has caused all these


---------59:40----------
people to


---------59:41----------
do this


---------59:47----------
i think i gave a lot to people and when


---------59:50----------
they see that i am like


---------59:51----------
that i have like one boundary or


---------59:53----------
something they get really upset


---------59:55----------
that's what it feels like um like there


---------60:00----------
was like one scenario with another


---------60:01----------
streamer where we um


---------60:04----------
um she wanted to go travel with me and


---------60:07----------
um


---------60:09----------
yeah but but i told her that i


---------60:12----------
that i couldn't i couldn't go travel


---------60:14----------
with her if i didn't stream


---------60:16----------
between like this time and this time


---------60:18----------
every single day


---------60:19----------
and for her it was really really


---------60:20----------
important for me to not stream at that


---------60:22----------
time because she wanted to stream and


---------60:23----------
she wanted to be


---------60:24----------
me to be on her stream um


---------60:27----------
well i'm not live so she could get more


---------60:29----------
viewers but i told her that


---------60:32----------
this is not my hobby as it is for you i


---------60:34----------
need to stream


---------60:35----------
because the past three weeks i haven't


---------60:37----------
streamed this much and i'm losing a lot


---------60:38----------
of money


---------60:39----------
and i feel like scared of yeah like i


---------60:42----------
need i need to uh i need to stream


---------60:45----------
and she was like okay yeah yeah but she


---------60:47----------
didn't really care about it and then


---------60:48----------
like when we came to the moment where


---------60:50----------
um where i turned my stream on and she


---------60:54----------
was streaming at the same time she got


---------60:56----------
really really really mad


---------60:58----------
and that's how the friendship ended just


---------61:00----------
like that


---------61:02----------
yeah that felt really weird because i


---------61:05----------
felt like i


---------61:05----------
helped her and then when i had one


---------61:07----------
boundary of like i needed a stream


---------61:09----------
because i needed to survive because i


---------61:11----------
was losing so much sure because


---------61:13----------
yeah she didn't respect that at all and


---------61:16----------
then


---------61:16----------
she just yeah she's left


---------61:20----------
yeah so that makes a lot of sense i mean


---------61:22----------
i i think that


---------61:23----------
in the sense of like a big thing for me


---------61:26----------
but it's just like really weird and i


---------61:27----------
see like


---------61:28----------
the stuff like this happens a lot yeah


---------61:30----------
so i i think


---------61:32----------
like i mentioned some time ago i think


---------61:33----------
that like maybe what we need to talk


---------61:35----------
about is boundaries


---------61:36----------
because i i do think it's possible that


---------61:38----------
something about the way that you start


---------61:40----------
your relationships


---------61:42----------
because you are so open because you are


---------61:45----------
so


---------61:45----------
caring because you are so supportive


---------61:49----------
makes people think that you don't have


---------61:51----------
boundaries


---------61:52----------
or and this is where if we really want


---------61:54----------
to say you're guilty of something


---------61:56----------
i would not be surprised i'd give it a


---------61:57----------
50 50 chance


---------61:59----------
that there are times early on in


---------62:01----------
relationships where you


---------62:04----------
willingly let people cross boundaries or


---------62:08----------
you don't enforce boundaries that you


---------62:10----------
should


---------62:12----------
and so if we really think about where


---------62:14----------
does the expectation like so people love


---------62:16----------
you molina because


---------62:18----------
when we talked about this last time you


---------62:20----------
put other people first


---------62:22----------
and i think actually i've seen a lot of


---------62:23----------
growth in you because now what i'm


---------62:25----------
hearing is like [ __ ] those people


---------62:27----------
i belong somewhere but it doesn't feel


---------62:30----------
very good it feels like that's not me


---------62:32----------
feeling that way yeah so i think this is


---------62:35----------
where you have to


---------62:36----------
start to learn how to i think be someone


---------62:38----------
who is like somewhere in the middle


---------62:40----------
right where you can be like open and


---------62:42----------
loving and caring


---------62:44----------
and also like set boundaries and


---------62:47----------
and this is where i'd really wonder i


---------62:48----------
think a lot of this comes down to the


---------62:50----------
beginning of the relationships it's like


---------62:51----------
when you enforce that tiny little


---------62:53----------
boundary at the beginning that doesn't


---------62:55----------
mean very much


---------62:56----------
how do you feel about yourself


---------63:00----------
um selfish i guess there you go


---------63:04----------
yeah it doesn't feel good yeah makes


---------63:07----------
me feel really bad about myself if i do


---------63:09----------
yep


---------63:12----------
so i think that's the big problem it


---------63:14----------
really makes me feel like a piece of


---------63:15----------
[ __ ] that's like how i feel yeah


---------63:17----------
yeah so is it normal surprisingly so


---------63:22----------
shockingly so but i think that's sort of


---------63:26----------
like where i


---------63:27----------
think honestly molina a lot of this


---------63:28----------
stuff i mean if we want to kind of like


---------63:30----------
pin it down to one thing i mean


---------63:31----------
obviously it's more complicated than


---------63:32----------
that


---------63:33----------
but i think what we're talking about is


---------63:34----------
like you engaging in relationships where


---------63:37----------
you know someone says hey molina can you


---------63:39----------
stop your stream 15 minutes early


---------63:41----------
because i'm having a headache and then


---------63:44----------
in that moment you're like oh my god i


---------63:46----------
would be such an [ __ ] i wouldn't be


---------63:48----------
the person that i want to be because you


---------63:50----------
have this version of yourself


---------63:52----------
which is like you know living in nature


---------63:55----------
being awesome being supportive that


---------63:56----------
people can count on taking care of your


---------63:58----------
mom


---------63:58----------
all this sort of stuff right and then


---------64:00----------
like in that moment


---------64:02----------
you sacrifice a little bit because you


---------64:04----------
don't want to feel like a bad person in


---------64:06----------
that moment


---------64:08----------
and then you sacrifice a little bit more


---------64:10----------
and you sacrifice a little bit more


---------64:12----------
and then they kind of like move in


---------64:15----------
into your personal space and then like


---------64:17----------
you finally have learned


---------64:20----------
how to set boundaries right so this


---------64:22----------
sounds like a really really healthy


---------64:23----------
conversation that you had with this


---------64:24----------
person


---------64:25----------
hey i'd love to travel with you here's


---------64:27----------
what i need


---------64:29----------
and then people get bent out of shape


---------64:30----------
when you're like hey you remember when i


---------64:32----------
told you i needed something and i


---------64:34----------
actually need it


---------64:35----------
and they're like how dare you and this


---------64:38----------
is where if you think about that like


---------64:39----------
why would someone respond that way it


---------64:41----------
may be because


---------64:42----------
in the past you have said hey i need to


---------64:44----------
do this


---------64:45----------
hey i need to do this and then you may


---------64:47----------
have let them slide and not actually


---------64:49----------
hold them


---------64:49----------
hold that boundary yeah


---------64:53----------
it's i don't i just like the outcome is


---------64:55----------
so crazy it just makes me think that no


---------64:57----------
one really gives a [ __ ]


---------64:58----------
about me i guess even i really feel like


---------65:01----------
that moment where i said i really need a


---------65:03----------
stream


---------65:04----------
that i feel i feel like that was like


---------65:05----------
completely fair of me but there's no


---------65:07----------
i can't believe like why did she get so


---------65:09----------
mad it's like so insane and then she


---------65:11----------
just wanted she just blocked me


---------65:13----------
everywhere


---------65:13----------
so so melina this is where i mean that


---------65:15----------
sounds like a terrible experience i


---------65:17----------
don't think you did anything wrong there


---------65:18----------
but i'm gonna say something because i


---------65:20----------
tend to have a bias


---------65:22----------
to empower and hold the person that i'm


---------65:26----------
talking to


---------65:27----------
accountable for their situation okay so


---------65:29----------
if this comes across as unsympathetic i


---------65:31----------
apologize


---------65:33----------
i think the reason that she is that way


---------65:35----------
is because you let her get away with it


---------65:38----------
for so long


---------65:40----------
yeah right and when you let people get


---------65:43----------
away with something like they're gonna


---------65:45----------
take


---------65:46----------
what they're used to mm-hmm


---------65:50----------
this is also something that's really


---------65:51----------
crazy maybe it's true that you say that


---------65:54----------
that since last time we spoke i'm


---------65:57----------
becoming a little bit more angry and i


---------65:59----------
put


---------65:59----------
more boundaries i've heard from so many


---------66:02----------
different people


---------66:03----------
that yeah after that dr k talk that you


---------66:05----------
had you're becoming way more


---------66:07----------
um arrogant and vic like you're


---------66:10----------
victimizing yourself all the time and


---------66:12----------
they got like really really mad for me


---------66:14----------
like


---------66:14----------
standing up for myself like a lot of


---------66:17----------
people have said that


---------66:19----------
to make me feel bad and that's really


---------66:21----------
weird i don't know


---------66:22----------
and this is like a lot like yeah a lot


---------66:25----------
of people


---------66:26----------
that i've known for like a long period


---------66:28----------
of time


---------66:30----------
well apologies for ruining your


---------66:31----------
relationships with those people


---------66:34----------
and at the same time if they're calling


---------66:36----------
you if they're calling you arrogant for


---------66:38----------
standing up for yourself


---------66:44----------
i mean so like when you stand up for


---------66:46----------
yourself in the people


---------66:48----------
yeah or that i'm like i shouldn't do


---------66:50----------
that or that should be okay for me or


---------66:51----------
something like that or this is a stupid


---------66:53----------
boundary or something like that


---------66:54----------
i've had people telling me that like


---------66:56----------
this is yeah so so


---------66:58----------
this is a stupid boundary is how sexual


---------67:00----------
assault happens


---------67:02----------
yeah that's true right so i think you've


---------67:05----------
just got to be really like


---------67:06----------
so it's very possible that you're more


---------67:09----------
arrogant


---------67:10----------
it's very possible that you perceive


---------67:14----------
setting your boundaries you call it


---------67:16----------
setting your boundaries but what you're


---------67:17----------
being in real life is an [ __ ] to the


---------67:19----------
people around you


---------67:20----------
that's possible because i've seen that


---------67:22----------
too where someone's like


---------67:23----------
i talked to dr k and i'm gonna set my


---------67:26----------
own boundaries


---------67:26----------
and my own boundaries means you can go


---------67:29----------
[ __ ] yourself


---------67:30----------
that's being an [ __ ] it's possible


---------67:33----------
so and this is where where molina like


---------67:35----------
you really may have turned into a little


---------67:37----------
bit of an [ __ ] because i think it's


---------67:38----------
new for you


---------67:39----------
right like you used to be so


---------67:41----------
accommodating


---------67:42----------
that you may have swung the pendulum too


---------67:44----------
far to the other side


---------67:45----------
and so this is where like it takes


---------67:46----------
practice between being a pushover


---------67:49----------
and being an [ __ ] and somewhere in


---------67:51----------
the middle


---------67:52----------
but frankly what you said i think makes


---------67:54----------
a lot of sense at least with the


---------67:55----------
streamer person that if you


---------67:56----------
had a conversation with them about what


---------67:58----------
your needs are


---------68:00----------
like over time i think people hopefully


---------68:02----------
like you


---------68:03----------
who learn this sort of stuff end up in


---------68:06----------
healthier relationships like


---------68:07----------
when when i teach someone how to stand


---------68:09----------
up for themselves


---------68:10----------
everyone around them is pissed about it


---------68:14----------
and then some of them adjust some of


---------68:16----------
them don't and then over time they find


---------68:18----------
like new friends that generally tend to


---------68:20----------
be healthier relationships


---------68:22----------
yeah so like just as a yeah


---------68:26----------
it's it's just crazy to me to like


---------68:29----------
imagine that people can be like this and


---------68:30----------
they can like be mad about


---------68:33----------
other people's boundaries it's just like


---------68:34----------
so insane i don't know for me that's


---------68:36----------
just like because i don't do that


---------68:39----------
or like yeah i feel like unbelievable to


---------68:41----------
me it's i don't understand like


---------68:43----------
here here's here's the common thread i


---------68:45----------
wouldn't think about it as them being


---------68:47----------
disrespectful of your boundaries what i


---------68:48----------
would think about is


---------68:50----------
what upsets people is when you confound


---------68:53----------
their expectations


---------68:55----------
so i don't think that these people are


---------68:57----------
like you know running around being


---------68:59----------
[ __ ] violating people's boundaries


---------69:01----------
and pushing people around i don't think


---------69:02----------
that's actually what's happening


---------69:03----------
that's what that's this that's what's


---------69:05----------
that's what this particular case may


---------69:06----------
look like from your perspective


---------69:08----------
i think what's really going on is you


---------69:10----------
have given people


---------69:12----------
a unspoken promise and then you're


---------69:15----------
taking that away


---------69:16----------
and that's what upsets people


---------69:19----------
right so it's sort of like um


---------69:23----------
you know it's like i'm working with


---------69:27----------
someone who


---------69:28----------
i'm working with a couple and one member


---------69:30----------
of the couple has decided to start


---------69:32----------
eating super healthy and it started


---------69:33----------
losing weight


---------69:35----------
and instead of being happy their partner


---------69:38----------
is just livid they're so


---------69:41----------
pissed off because now like there be


---------69:44----------
it's being exposed to them like how


---------69:46----------
unhealthy they're eating like one


---------69:48----------
person's trying to take care of


---------69:49----------
themselves


---------69:50----------
and like the other person is really


---------69:51----------
really like upset they're frustrated


---------69:54----------
they feel super self-conscious for


---------69:56----------
eating crappy food all the time


---------69:57----------
you know their partner is like getting


---------69:59----------
into shape and it is like one of the


---------70:01----------
most


---------70:02----------
toxic difficult things yeah


---------70:05----------
and so you could say i i can't believe


---------70:07----------
that someone would be upset that someone


---------70:08----------
else wants to eat healthy like


---------70:10----------
of course that doesn't make any sense


---------70:11----------
but what's going on is we were both


---------70:13----------
gonna be degenerate pizza eating


---------70:14----------
[ __ ] together and then you


---------70:15----------
decided to go get healthy and now what


---------70:17----------
am i supposed to do


---------70:18----------
i feel that also a lot about like


---------70:20----------
because i didn't i didn't really stream


---------70:22----------
a year ago and then when i started


---------70:23----------
streaming a lot of other people that i


---------70:25----------
know that streams as well


---------70:27----------
and when i like got like more viewers


---------70:29----------
than them and stuff they started getting


---------70:30----------
like really angry


---------70:31----------
and they would never want to like give


---------70:33----------
me a compliment about it they were just


---------70:35----------
like [ __ ] on me for


---------70:36----------
like doing the content that i was doing


---------70:37----------
and stuff like that


---------70:39----------
yeah so like i said when it comes to


---------70:41----------
relationships between streamers like


---------70:43----------
numbers and quantification and one


---------70:45----------
person growing and one person being left


---------70:47----------
behind like all that kind of stuff


---------70:49----------
isn't complicating factor right so like


---------70:52----------
it's it's hard because


---------70:54----------
it you know in your friend's case did


---------70:56----------
she respect your boundaries no was that


---------70:58----------
nice of her no


---------70:59----------
but then we also have to try to be like


---------71:01----------
understand from her perspective


---------71:03----------
she maybe saw this as an opportunity for


---------71:05----------
her to grow her stream


---------71:07----------
and she kind of sees you as taking that


---------71:09----------
away from her


---------71:10----------
and and so it's it's sort of like


---------71:12----------
there's a whole different


---------71:13----------
angle right so you're saying that i have


---------71:15----------
to stream because i need the money


---------71:17----------
and i can't take the hit and she's


---------71:19----------
thinking the same thing


---------71:20----------
and you're thinking how can she be so


---------71:22----------
heartless this is something i need to do


---------71:24----------
for money and she's actually having the


---------71:26----------
same thoughts how can molina be so


---------71:28----------
heartless and take streamers away from


---------71:30----------
me she's bigger than i am


---------71:31----------
she could grow my stream but instead


---------71:33----------
she's like picking herself over me


---------71:36----------
and both of y'all are like thinking the


---------71:38----------
same thing does that


---------71:40----------
make sense yeah it does not


---------71:43----------
i really think in that case just based


---------71:45----------
on what you said i think you're


---------71:46----------
absolutely in the right there because if


---------71:47----------
you have particular needs and you lay


---------71:49----------
that out with people and someone agrees


---------71:50----------
and then


---------71:51----------
it turns out that you know you're living


---------71:54----------
up to what you said


---------71:56----------
yeah you know thoughts


---------72:00----------
questions um sometimes people


---------72:04----------
try to like i don't know if i mean they


---------72:06----------
kind of like try to manipulate me a


---------72:08----------
little bit i don't even know if they're


---------72:09----------
like


---------72:10----------
conscious of like doing that but


---------72:12----------
sometimes if i can talk to people


---------72:14----------
and i'm saying no or like i can't do


---------72:16----------
this or something like that they're


---------72:17----------
trying to like make me feel


---------72:19----------
as guilty as possible by saying a lot of


---------72:21----------
really horrible things


---------72:23----------
like what did they say like um


---------72:27----------
my mom my mom tried to like force me to


---------72:31----------
be in a call with her for two hours


---------72:35----------
saying that that i am a horrible person


---------72:38----------
for not wanting to talk to her and stuff


---------72:40----------
like that


---------72:40----------
and that if i didn't speak to her and


---------72:43----------
listen to her complain about


---------72:44----------
what is she the person i am to her


---------72:46----------
because i'm not doing this and this


---------72:47----------
isn't that she gonna go kill herself


---------72:49----------
stuff like that so like it's like really


---------72:53----------
insane and she knows she has like the


---------72:55----------
control over me as well


---------72:56----------
she knows she has that because i'm her


---------72:58----------
daughter and this is what she's been


---------73:00----------
doing for


---------73:01----------
like forever um so that was like really


---------73:04----------
really hard and i couldn't hang up


---------73:06----------
like i just can't physically hang up on


---------73:08----------
her it's like too much


---------73:09----------
and i was just like freaking out because


---------73:11----------
she is like


---------73:13----------
really really really making me feel so


---------73:15----------
incredibly shitty about myself i am so


---------73:16----------
sorry melina that sounds


---------73:18----------
terrible yeah so i tried to just avoid


---------73:21----------
talking to her but then i like i get a


---------73:22----------
message i'm like [ __ ] i feel so guilty


---------73:24----------
i'm like not calling her but i don't


---------73:25----------
want to call her because i can't like i


---------73:27----------
can't


---------73:27----------
i can't talk to her because she's so


---------73:30----------
deep down


---------73:31----------
and she's been doing that to me since i


---------73:34----------
was a kid


---------73:35----------
that's [ __ ] up yeah i feel like if


---------73:40----------
i then talk to her for probably like


---------73:41----------
four months and then i kind of realized


---------73:43----------
that all the things that i


---------73:44----------
felt about her when i was a kid and that


---------73:46----------
i feel still like when i talk to her


---------73:49----------
is like like i feel a small version of


---------73:53----------
that with everyone else when stuff like


---------73:54----------
this happens but i feel that even more


---------73:56----------
with her


---------73:58----------
yeah and i think it kind of comes from


---------74:01----------
i think it comes from that relationship


---------74:03----------
with harats i had as a kid


---------74:07----------
okay


---------74:10----------
yeah so let's


---------74:17----------
let me think for a second man molina


---------74:20----------
you're very insightful


---------74:22----------
what does that mean insightful yeah


---------74:25----------
sorry


---------74:26----------
you're really good at figuring things


---------74:28----------
out i think i'm pretty


---------74:30----------
you're very good at connecting the dots


---------74:32----------
and recognizing things


---------74:34----------
thank you i'm just thinking about


---------74:42----------
how to help you with this


---------74:46----------
okay so how are you feeling right now


---------74:49----------
you feeling okay


---------74:52----------
i'm gonna point somehow yeah i mean i'm


---------74:56----------
like very


---------74:57----------
like i feel like if it was maybe like a


---------75:00----------
year ago i would probably very


---------75:02----------
be like very upset i would be looking


---------75:03----------
very upset but right now i'm just like


---------75:05----------
so numb


---------75:06----------
yeah i guess so i think part of it is


---------75:09----------
numbness


---------75:10----------
part of it is strength


---------75:14----------
um so


---------75:18----------
i'm gonna say something i'm gonna point


---------75:19----------
something out in your thought process


---------75:20----------
which is super super tricky okay


---------75:23----------
it may come across as judgmental because


---------75:25----------
i'm going to point out your role in this


---------75:27----------
okay


---------75:28----------
yeah sure so on the one hand so on the


---------75:30----------
one hand


---------75:31----------
it sounds like your mom has been very


---------75:33----------
very emotionally manipulative


---------75:35----------
continues to be emotionally manipulative


---------75:37----------
and is really


---------75:38----------
chipped away at some part of you


---------75:42----------
that i think like other people can like


---------75:45----------
then


---------75:46----------
use like you have a vulnerability of


---------75:48----------
being emotionally manipulated by like


---------75:50----------
other people needing your support right


---------75:53----------
and this is why at the very beginning


---------75:54----------
when they're like hey molina can you


---------75:56----------
stop


---------75:56----------
streaming 15 minutes early and then


---------75:57----------
you're like i feel self-loathing if i


---------75:59----------
say


---------76:02----------
no i can't i'm sorry you have to give in


---------76:04----------
to them so that goes the whole boundary


---------76:05----------
thing that we were talking about you see


---------76:07----------
that like that's connected


---------76:08----------
so i think the reason that you feel that


---------76:10----------
way about yourself is because


---------76:13----------
your mom like


---------76:16----------
like wrote that into your programming so


---------76:19----------
you've got this like one vulnerability


---------76:21----------
that i suspect a lot of people


---------76:23----------
so this is where like you know human


---------76:25----------
beings will sniff around for like what


---------76:27----------
they're looking for


---------76:28----------
and you may actually attract people who


---------76:31----------
like


---------76:32----------
use that vulnerability on you


---------76:35----------
because when they need something from


---------76:37----------
you and then you're like oh yeah let me


---------76:38----------
give it to you and they're like oh


---------76:39----------
awesome


---------76:41----------
and then what they do is they start to


---------76:42----------
like be a little bit emotionally


---------76:43----------
manipulative and like


---------76:45----------
like you said now we're gonna get to the


---------76:46----------
tricky part because you say people


---------76:48----------
don't do it consciously but they make me


---------76:51----------
feel a certain way


---------76:53----------
now this is where we're gonna get really


---------76:55----------
potentially me being an [ __ ]


---------76:56----------
and potentially you know running against


---------76:58----------
a lot of popular


---------77:00----------
um thought nowadays i mean like it's


---------77:03----------
fine like i get a lot of criticism and i


---------77:05----------
get people telling me a lot of things


---------77:07----------
all the time that's fine yeah so


---------77:08----------
so let me know if this feels critical to


---------77:10----------
you okay so i think you've got to be


---------77:11----------
careful when you're when you tell me


---------77:13----------
that someone doesn't consciously want to


---------77:15----------
make you feel that way


---------77:17----------
if you feel like they're emotionally


---------77:20----------
manipulating you


---------77:21----------
and the reason you say that they're


---------77:22----------
emotionally manipulating you is because


---------77:24----------
this person says something and i feel


---------77:26----------
guilty


---------77:27----------
that's what you call emotional


---------77:28----------
manipulation right but that may actually


---------77:30----------
have nothing to do with them that may


---------77:32----------
have everything to do with you


---------77:34----------
yeah right so so so that's where like i


---------77:37----------
think you've got to be really really


---------77:38----------
careful


---------77:40----------
where um so i


---------77:44----------
because i don't know that people are


---------77:46----------
emotionally manipulating you i think


---------77:47----------
it's just


---------77:48----------
in the past when you try to raise that


---------77:51----------
boundary


---------77:52----------
your mom emotionally manipulates and so


---------77:55----------
your brain is doing what all brains do


---------77:58----------
and it's learned from the past and it's


---------78:00----------
applying the past to the present


---------78:02----------
so i know that sounds kind of weird but


---------78:03----------
like you know every time i see a toilet


---------78:05----------
that i've never used before


---------78:07----------
how do i know how to flush the toilet


---------78:10----------
it's because my brain is projecting


---------78:12----------
prior toilets onto this one


---------78:14----------
and i treat this toilet like all of the


---------78:16----------
other toilets


---------78:17----------
and so what your brain is doing is you


---------78:19----------
had so much of this stuff from your mom


---------78:21----------
that anytime someone does something that


---------78:24----------
sort of looks like your mom or smells


---------78:25----------
like your mom


---------78:26----------
you feel the same way that you did with


---------78:28----------
your mom and you're kind of applying it


---------78:30----------
to this scenario


---------78:32----------
yeah does that feel critical or


---------78:35----------
invalidating to you


---------78:37----------
okay because i think you are doing a


---------78:39----------
piece of this and i'd be really careful


---------78:41----------
because i think some people around you


---------78:42----------
are really emotionally manipulative


---------78:44----------
because they've sensed out that weakness


---------78:46----------
in you and that's how they like they


---------78:47----------
need people like that


---------78:49----------
they have emotional needs and they know


---------78:51----------
that molina's good


---------78:52----------
day or night if i'm hurting molina's


---------78:56----------
going to drop whatever she's doing


---------78:57----------
and she's going to take care of me and


---------78:59----------
then you reinforce that right because


---------79:01----------
you have this [ __ ]


---------79:02----------
you don't give yourself a break because


---------79:04----------
you want yourself to be this perfect


---------79:06----------
version of yourself that your mom turned


---------79:07----------
you into


---------79:08----------
whereas like i think you should be a


---------79:09----------
little bit of a [ __ ] like that's my


---------79:10----------
favorite molina


---------79:13----------
you know like where you can own the


---------79:15----------
space that you control


---------79:16----------
and you can set some limits and like you


---------79:18----------
can try to make the world a better place


---------79:20----------
but


---------79:21----------
you don't have to like sacrifice


---------79:22----------
yourself to do it


---------79:26----------
so i think you've got to be careful and


---------79:28----------
and this goes for everyone else who's


---------79:30----------
listening to that like you got


---------79:31----------
got to be careful if you if you start


---------79:34----------
letting other people control


---------79:36----------
your feelings now i think some of that


---------79:37----------
stuff like in the case of your mom or if


---------79:39----------
you're in like you know


---------79:40----------
alcoholic parents like it's really hard


---------79:41----------
to control that sort of stuff but i


---------79:43----------
think it quickly becomes like you do


---------79:45----------
have some control over that


---------79:47----------
and there's this guy named victor


---------79:48----------
frankel who was uh one of the jews who


---------79:50----------
was in


---------79:51----------
the holocaust concentration camps and he


---------79:54----------
wrote this book about man's search for


---------79:55----------
meaning and he actually went all the way


---------79:57----------
to saying


---------79:58----------
that the nazis actually don't control


---------80:00----------
anything about how i feel


---------80:01----------
they can kill me but how i feel and is


---------80:04----------
my choice


---------80:05----------
which is drastic buddha said the same


---------80:06----------
thing too we don't really you know in


---------80:08----------
the world of like


---------80:09----------
microaggressions and stuff we tend to


---------80:10----------
hold other people accountable for our


---------80:12----------
feelings


---------80:13----------
which i think is really dangerous


---------80:14----------
territory


---------80:16----------
but i would be how do i change and like


---------80:19----------
the way i feel about things how do i


---------80:21----------
like approach and like change my mind


---------80:24----------
beautiful question yeah okay so


---------80:28----------
the first thing is that i think that


---------80:30----------
you've got to give yourself


---------80:31----------
time to learn how to set boundaries and


---------80:34----------
recognize that like when you become


---------80:36----------
confident sometimes what you need is


---------80:38----------
like


---------80:39----------
a friend group transplant so i see this


---------80:41----------
a lot in people who have


---------80:42----------
social anxiety and who are doormats is


---------80:45----------
that when they start like when we start


---------80:46----------
developing confidence they actually like


---------80:48----------
will lose a lot of their friends and


---------80:50----------
like over time they'll get new ones


---------80:53----------
very practically i'd strongly strongly


---------80:55----------
consider i know this is hard during


---------80:56----------
covent


---------80:57----------
but i think that these kinds of social


---------80:58----------
interactions are amplified by the


---------81:01----------
stresses of streaming


---------81:03----------
so i think the more friends that you


---------81:04----------
have outside of streaming the less of an


---------81:06----------
issue this is going to be


---------81:07----------
because when streaming like people's


---------81:09----------
careers and livelihoods are on the line


---------81:11----------
so it like


---------81:11----------
evokes a lot of behavior you know um


---------81:15----------
so so that's one thing so like learn


---------81:19----------
continue to learn how to set boundaries


---------81:21----------
and what i would really be careful the


---------81:23----------
most important concrete piece of advice


---------81:25----------
that i have for you


---------81:26----------
is early on in the relationship hold


---------81:28----------
that boundary


---------81:29----------
even though you feel like a piece of


---------81:30----------
[ __ ] that's the most important mistake i


---------81:33----------
think you're making that you can very


---------81:34----------
practically change


---------81:36----------
so like when you have a new friend it's


---------81:37----------
gonna come up and you gotta wait for it


---------81:39----------
they're gonna say hey can you do huh


---------81:42----------
you think that feeling will disappear


---------81:44----------
after a while yes


---------81:46----------
it's going to be there forever no i


---------81:48----------
think it'll disappear but there are


---------81:49----------
other things you have to do to make it


---------81:50----------
disappear


---------81:51----------
that's going to be the start so so


---------81:52----------
remember molina that even if that


---------81:54----------
feeling doesn't disappear


---------81:57----------
when you give in to that feeling you are


---------81:59----------
going down


---------82:00----------
the relationship path that leads to


---------82:03----------
betrayal


---------82:04----------
when you enforce a boundary so even


---------82:08----------
even if it hurts to feel like an [ __ ]


---------82:10----------
recognize that


---------82:11----------
that pain in that moment and feeling


---------82:13----------
like an [ __ ] doesn't actually mean


---------82:15----------
you're an [ __ ]


---------82:16----------
you just have to feel like one


---------82:19----------
that protects you from going down the


---------82:21----------
road of people taking advantage of you


---------82:23----------
you


---------82:24----------
laying an eventual boundary and then


---------82:25----------
then them feeling betrayed


---------82:27----------
that's the price you have to pay either


---------82:29----------
you feel like it like hated


---------82:31----------
and betrayed six months from now or you


---------82:34----------
feel like a little bit of a [ __ ] today


---------82:38----------
you can also as you're good at right


---------82:40----------
because you've got a lot of good talents


---------82:41----------
here


---------82:42----------
your tendency to confront check in with


---------82:45----------
them afterward


---------82:47----------
say hey i'm sorry i couldn't pick you up


---------82:49----------
from the airport because i had to stream


---------82:52----------
do you think that was like i feel kind


---------82:55----------
of guilty about that do you


---------82:56----------
feel like i was out of line


---------82:59----------
right just talk to him about it yeah and


---------83:01----------
then they say like oh no i totally get


---------83:03----------
it like i could just take an uber it's


---------83:05----------
like not that big of a deal


---------83:06----------
i was a little bit disappointed but and


---------83:09----------
then some people are going to be like oh


---------83:11----------
yeah


---------83:11----------
you are a complete [ __ ] and those are


---------83:13----------
the people you want to knock out of your


---------83:14----------
life


---------83:16----------
right so that's so the first thing is


---------83:19----------
set that boundary


---------83:20----------
early and often and recognize that the


---------83:21----------
reason that people don't set


---------83:23----------
boundaries is because of good feelings


---------83:26----------
not bad feelings


---------83:27----------
so this is tricky because good feelings


---------83:30----------
get


---------83:30----------
like you want to be a good friend you


---------83:31----------
don't want to be guilty and so it's


---------83:33----------
going to be hard to set that boundary so


---------83:34----------
set that boundary early


---------83:36----------
okay next thing


---------83:39----------
so this what you're describing is a


---------83:41----------
perfect example of the sunscript term


---------83:43----------
some scott


---------83:44----------
so some scott is a ball of undigested


---------83:47----------
emotion


---------83:48----------
which sort of lies dormant it's like a


---------83:50----------
volcano underneath the surface


---------83:52----------
and then it activates at times and like


---------83:54----------
wreaks havoc on your psychology


---------83:57----------
so there are a couple of different ways


---------83:58----------
to digest to some scar


---------84:00----------
i would strongly recommend have you ever


---------84:02----------
seen a therapist about this stuff with


---------84:03----------
your mom


---------84:05----------
um yeah but that turned out really bad


---------84:10----------
um if i ask you questions about that are


---------84:13----------
we gonna learn about bad boundaries


---------84:15----------
more um


---------84:19----------
that situation that was wait is that i


---------84:21----------
think that's like the third


---------84:22----------
therapist i've ever had in my entire


---------84:23----------
life and i didn't have a therapist for a


---------84:25----------
very long time


---------84:26----------
um but this guy actually tried to be


---------84:29----------
sexual with me


---------84:30----------
i [ __ ] knew it yeah


---------84:34----------
see how did you know that cause like


---------84:37----------
that like i said if i ask you about this


---------84:39----------
are we gonna run into another boundary


---------84:40----------
conversation


---------84:41----------
yeah but like how am i supposed to like


---------84:44----------
do about that like this is supposed to


---------84:46----------
be a therapist like


---------84:47----------
yeah that's their problem not yours


---------84:49----------
they're supposed to see that [ __ ]


---------84:51----------
recognize that they're gonna feel all


---------84:54----------
kinds of weird ways about you


---------84:55----------
and like restrain themselves turns out


---------84:58----------
that it you probably got a shitty


---------85:00----------
therapist


---------85:00----------
i'm sorry but i'm not surprised that it


---------85:03----------
happened


---------85:04----------
okay so so this is where you got to give


---------85:07----------
it another shot


---------85:08----------
maybe find a female therapist who is not


---------85:11----------
a lesbian or bisexual


---------85:12----------
that'll help but then you're gonna get


---------85:14----------
other kinds of weird boundary violations


---------85:16----------
there too that they need to be super


---------85:17----------
careful about


---------85:18----------
but i strongly strongly recommend


---------85:21----------
that you know like this is the kind of


---------85:25----------
thing where like you've been


---------85:26----------
[ __ ] traumatized like this sounds bad


---------85:28----------
and it sounds like it's ongoing and you


---------85:30----------
deserve help


---------85:31----------
and like we're not built to figure this


---------85:34----------
out on our own


---------85:35----------
okay there's a whole profession that is


---------85:37----------
designed to help you with this sort of


---------85:38----------
thing


---------85:40----------
second thing that you can do is sign up


---------85:43----------
for our


---------85:44----------
our creator coaching program do you know


---------85:45----------
about this i think i messaged you about


---------85:47----------
this so


---------85:47----------
we now like so we're working thankfully


---------85:50----------
twitch has been like kind enough to


---------85:52----------
really support us and support their


---------85:53----------
content


---------85:54----------
creators where like these issues of


---------85:56----------
anxiety and burnout and these sorts of


---------85:58----------
boundaries sort of things are like


---------86:00----------
something that we as an


---------86:01----------
organization are trying to support


---------86:03----------
content creators with


---------86:05----------
so this is also where we have to be


---------86:06----------
really careful and if you end up signing


---------86:08----------
up for this program it's free for you by


---------86:09----------
the way


---------86:10----------
um so that's thanks to twitch you can


---------86:13----------
thank twitch for that


---------86:15----------
um so uh so


---------86:18----------
this is where um you know we're gonna


---------86:21----------
have to be really careful that your


---------86:22----------
coach doesn't fall into this


---------86:24----------
so like if you sign up for the coaching


---------86:25----------
program like i'm gonna know


---------86:27----------
who your coach is and i'm gonna prep


---------86:29----------
your coach because you're gonna evoke


---------86:31----------
particular feelings in them


---------86:33----------
and then like we're gonna like help like


---------86:35----------
we know it's coming


---------86:36----------
so we can probably handle it we can


---------86:38----------
handle it i'm pretty


---------86:39----------
sure we can wait what exactly am i doing


---------86:41----------
that makes them think that they can like


---------86:43----------
well like i'm really curious what could


---------86:45----------
i even be doing like


---------86:46----------
for people to like think that they can


---------86:48----------
just do something like that


---------86:52----------
okay i'm just thinking about how i can


---------86:55----------
answer that


---------86:57----------
yeah i'm just really curious


---------87:02----------
so here's what happens in coaching


---------87:04----------
relationships and also in therapy


---------87:05----------
okay so freud are you are you on an


---------87:09----------
academic answer because you're about to


---------87:10----------
get an academic answer


---------87:13----------
i i only went to high school that's fine


---------87:16----------
i think you're okay okay so


---------87:20----------
so freud basically noticed that


---------87:23----------
when you're in a therapy relationship


---------87:26----------
that people will project feelings on


---------87:29----------
each other


---------87:30----------
and so a lot of what a therapist feels


---------87:34----------
is like not a real feeling but it's like


---------87:38----------
you and the patient are acting out of


---------87:40----------
play


---------87:41----------
so for example if you had issues of like


---------87:44----------
being emotionally manipulated


---------87:46----------
by your mom and you go see a female


---------87:49----------
therapist


---------87:50----------
you are going to feel emotionally


---------87:52----------
manipulated by her


---------87:55----------
because like as you guys calm your mind


---------87:57----------
down and as you enter like an authentic


---------88:00----------
space and those feelings come up they're


---------88:03----------
going to like want to target


---------88:05----------
does that make sense it's just it's just


---------88:08----------
weird


---------88:08----------
and so sometimes in therapy what can


---------88:10----------
happen is that like so


---------88:12----------
this is something called erotic


---------88:13----------
transference or erotic counter


---------88:15----------
transference


---------88:16----------
you can even google it their papers


---------88:18----------
written about it because it happens


---------88:19----------
shockingly


---------88:20----------
a lot and what we find is that like


---------88:23----------
sometimes feelings can get tangled right


---------88:25----------
so so


---------88:26----------
i i [ __ ] you not this is one of the most


---------88:29----------
mind-blowingly abusive quotes i've ever


---------88:31----------
heard


---------88:32----------
but one of my therapy supervisors once


---------88:35----------
had a therapy supervisor


---------88:38----------
that told them so there's like a boomer


---------88:41----------
okay so like


---------88:42----------
a psychiatrist who was like around in


---------88:44----------
the 50s once said


---------88:47----------
the main thing to think about when you


---------88:49----------
have sex with a patient is whether


---------88:50----------
you're having sex for yourself or you're


---------88:52----------
doing it for them


---------88:54----------
oh interesting right so like it's all


---------88:57----------
[ __ ] up


---------88:58----------
but this is where sometimes what happens


---------89:00----------
is you get especially in a therapy


---------89:02----------
relationship you feel


---------89:03----------
super connected to someone you feel like


---------89:06----------
really really close to them and then


---------89:08----------
sometimes people


---------89:10----------
don't know like what to do with those


---------89:12----------
feelings of closeness


---------89:14----------
and so it sort of starts to manifest in


---------89:16----------
like a sexual kind of way because


---------89:18----------
they're like


---------89:19----------
oh i feel so connected right and if you


---------89:20----------
think about sexuality like a lot of it


---------89:22----------
is about emotional connection it can it


---------89:24----------
can get muddled it can get confusing


---------89:28----------
and then sometimes people will like you


---------89:30----------
know


---------89:34----------
get confused and therapists aren't


---------89:36----------
perfect either


---------89:37----------
and i do think that there's something


---------89:39----------
about the radiance that you display


---------89:42----------
that is like flies going to honey


---------89:45----------
towards like a


---------89:46----------
particular kind of person you have a


---------89:47----------
particular vulnerability that like gets


---------89:49----------
people to like leech onto you


---------89:52----------
um and this is the kind of thing where


---------89:53----------
that therapist is that's [ __ ]


---------89:56----------
that's terrible but like holy [ __ ] you


---------89:58----------
could see that coming from a mile away


---------90:00----------
i feel really weird too because like


---------90:02----------
when i kind of like


---------90:03----------
made excuses not to go there he would


---------90:05----------
kind of like make me feel guilty for


---------90:07----------
that


---------90:07----------
see i told you he's gonna he's gonna do


---------90:09----------
it to you


---------90:10----------
yeah he's gonna make you feel guilty


---------90:13----------
yeah


---------90:14----------
that's the some scar it's the whole like


---------90:17----------
it's like


---------90:20----------
textbook right and that's where


---------90:23----------
that's where like with a good therapist


---------90:25----------
what you should say if you guys are like


---------90:27----------
here's a little bit of education about


---------90:28----------
therapy


---------90:29----------
if you guys are feeling reluctance to go


---------90:31----------
see your therapist


---------90:33----------
tell them about it and this is where


---------90:35----------
like the right move as a patient is hey


---------90:38----------
i feel i feel like there's a weird


---------90:40----------
energy here when i come here


---------90:42----------
and it may be a little bit sexual just


---------90:44----------
confront them molina


---------90:46----------
and say that i sometimes feel


---------90:47----------
emotionally manipulated into coming here


---------90:49----------
and i feel deeply uncomfortable about it


---------90:52----------
that'll bring awareness to it he also um


---------90:56----------
he also said that i didn't have to pay


---------90:58----------
anymore and stuff that was really weird


---------90:59----------
yeah


---------91:00----------
boundary violations boundaries


---------91:01----------
boundaries boundaries boundaries


---------91:03----------
boundaries boundaries


---------91:05----------
okay that's really weird that's


---------91:07----------
[Music]


---------91:09----------
boundaries it's all about boundaries


---------91:12----------
okay


---------91:14----------
so sometimes i will stop accepting money


---------91:16----------
from people


---------91:18----------
in a therapy relationship but never


---------91:20----------
because i like them so much


---------91:24----------
the only reason that i stop accepting


---------91:26----------
money is because people can't afford


---------91:27----------
it in which case it's like i'm not gonna


---------91:30----------
stop taking care of you as your doctor


---------91:31----------
just because you're [ __ ] broke right


---------91:34----------
so like they're they're like good


---------91:35----------
reasons so that's also like a policy


---------91:37----------
that i lay out with people that i see at


---------91:39----------
the beginning


---------91:42----------
but yeah this sounds bad molina like


---------91:44----------
yeah


---------91:45----------
yeah and yeah that's why i started like


---------91:48----------
to not really like open up a lot about


---------91:50----------
how i felt about things i don't know


---------91:52----------
everything it feels like every single


---------91:54----------
time i start talking


---------91:55----------
like i don't know if he just feels like


---------91:57----------
stuff like that happens


---------91:58----------
um do you feel emotionally manipulated


---------92:01----------
by me


---------92:03----------
no okay


---------92:06----------
i don't think so if we keep talking


---------92:09----------
it'll happen


---------92:10----------
you really thinks a lot absolutely and


---------92:13----------
that's when we could really work on it


---------92:16----------
right so like when it comes up then we


---------92:18----------
would talk through it and you'd like


---------92:19----------
learn how to digest it


---------92:22----------
so anyway more practical advice so how


---------92:24----------
can you move forward so first thing is


---------92:26----------
is you know like i said think about


---------92:28----------
boundaries


---------92:29----------
be a little bit more of an [ __ ] to


---------92:31----------
people early on in relationships


---------92:33----------
yeah okay this is also something that is


---------92:35----------
like really weird


---------92:36----------
it's like last time and this happens


---------92:39----------
like this is happening already so like


---------92:41----------
last time i talked to you there was so


---------92:43----------
many people that knows that they hurt me


---------92:45----------
so much in the past


---------92:47----------
would like come back and try to like


---------92:51----------
i don't know like be nice to me or


---------92:54----------
something like that but then i would


---------92:55----------
just realize that they wanted something


---------92:57----------
as well so it was just like really weird


---------92:59----------
too and like


---------93:00----------
i don't know it's like and then i feel


---------93:02----------
bad for like not rip


---------93:05----------
you know yeah and they know that too


---------93:07----------
they know that i'm feeling


---------93:08----------
bad about it too yeah so this is where


---------93:10----------
they [ __ ] off like don't message me if


---------93:12----------
you hurt me [ __ ]


---------93:13----------
i don't want anyone to do that after


---------93:14----------
this session okay [ __ ] off that's like


---------93:16----------
how i


---------93:16----------
because i i can't do it i don't want to


---------93:18----------
do that yeah yeah yeah


---------93:20----------
so let's talk about that okay so this is


---------93:21----------
great so it's like the same patterns


---------93:23----------
you see that it's like patterns and


---------93:25----------
that's sort of good it sucks for you


---------93:27----------
because it sounds awful


---------93:29----------
but it's also like hopeful because if


---------93:31----------
there's a pattern you and you change the


---------93:32----------
whole pattern


---------93:33----------
your entire life will start to be like


---------93:35----------
different


---------93:36----------
so this is where like you know if people


---------93:37----------
do reach out to you afterward because


---------93:39----------
they hurt you and they're feeling guilty


---------93:41----------
yeah you can have a mature i mean this


---------93:43----------
is where i wouldn't tell them to go [ __ ]


---------93:45----------
off


---------93:46----------
because you can get some closure there i


---------93:48----------
mean you can tell them to go [ __ ] off


---------93:49----------
but when you're ready i think it's


---------93:51----------
useful to have conversations about


---------93:52----------
closure


---------93:53----------
yeah and you can say hey i haven't


---------93:56----------
talked to you in eight months just speak


---------93:57----------
plainly okay i'm gonna give you a


---------93:58----------
playbook for this


---------93:59----------
yeah okay so if they're watching this


---------94:01----------
they'll know the playbook too but this


---------94:02----------
is good this is good


---------94:03----------
so just speak plainly and be like be


---------94:05----------
like okay


---------94:07----------
what is she doing no no this is good


---------94:09----------
this is good it's healthy it's healthy


---------94:10----------
for them too it's healthy for everybody


---------94:12----------
so just be like hey i haven't heard from


---------94:13----------
you in eight months


---------94:15----------
is there a particular reason that you're


---------94:17----------
reaching out to me now


---------94:20----------
and then they'll say they'll make some


---------94:21----------
like they won't actually say it they'll


---------94:22----------
be like oh i was just wondering how


---------94:23----------
you're doing


---------94:24----------
then you can you can say i'm doing okay


---------94:27----------
thank you for asking


---------94:28----------
period and then that's it


---------94:32----------
if they want to engage in a conversation


---------94:33----------
if they push it further you just let


---------94:35----------
them know how you feel and you can say


---------94:37----------
hey i really felt like you know when we


---------94:40----------
the last time we talked like eight


---------94:41----------
months ago you said some things to me


---------94:43----------
that i felt like were sort of like a


---------94:44----------
betrayal i'm a little bit confused


---------94:46----------
about what you want from this


---------94:48----------
relationship


---------94:50----------
yeah and then if they and this is where


---------94:53----------
like you're you're gonna when you say


---------94:55----------
things like that you're gonna feel


---------94:56----------
guilty because you're like oh my god i'm


---------94:58----------
making them feel bad oh


---------95:00----------
how dare i tell them that they hurt me


---------95:03----------
when they hurt me so much


---------95:04----------
i can't tell them that they did that


---------95:08----------
look at how much of a [ __ ] i would be


---------95:11----------
uh


---------95:12----------
right but that's you need to be


---------95:13----------
authentic with them and just say hey


---------95:15----------
what you did hurt me


---------95:17----------
and then get like and then they can say


---------95:19----------
well that's because you were being a


---------95:21----------
[ __ ]


---------95:22----------
and then that like that's fine they can


---------95:23----------
go [ __ ] themselves right you'll see and


---------95:25----------
sometimes they'll say that and then


---------95:26----------
sometimes they'll say yeah i'm really


---------95:28----------
sorry about that


---------95:30----------
i'm sorry i hurt you it could be could


---------95:31----------
go either way but either way you get


---------95:34----------
closure


---------95:35----------
and then if you also here's also thing


---------95:37----------
this is like so insane i had like one


---------95:39----------
person do this and then i found out that


---------95:41----------
this person


---------95:42----------
was just doing that to like try to get


---------95:44----------
information


---------95:45----------
about me so they could go [ __ ] talk to


---------95:47----------
other people about me or try to like sit


---------95:48----------
and laugh and


---------95:49----------
basically it's like really weird i don't


---------95:52----------
know like yeah i don't know


---------95:53----------
i don't know what about you why you


---------95:55----------
attract all the drama [ __ ] i


---------95:57----------
i don't know that is beyond my my


---------96:00----------
expertise but it's like really


---------96:02----------
there's like a part of it that is really


---------96:03----------
like this person like this person


---------96:05----------
[ __ ] idiot and i can see like exactly


---------96:07----------
what they're doing but then like i just


---------96:08----------
feel


---------96:09----------
you know like yeah they're bad so so i


---------96:11----------
wouldn't i wouldn't tell them


---------96:12----------
you know if they're like hey melina how


---------96:13----------
are you doing and if you say


---------96:16----------
hey i can see what you're doing you're


---------96:17----------
you're being a [ __ ] manipulative


---------96:18----------
[ __ ] and you're just trying to get


---------96:19----------
information


---------96:20----------
that that's gonna make you sound like a


---------96:22----------
crazy lady yeah


---------96:24----------
right it's like i was just asking you if


---------96:26----------
you wanted to


---------96:27----------
come on stream because we're playing


---------96:29----------
among us like


---------96:31----------
right so so just be like so you want to


---------96:33----------
test the waters right so you want to be


---------96:34----------
authentic and vague oh hey i haven't


---------96:36----------
heard from you in a while what's going


---------96:37----------
on


---------96:38----------
and then if the relationship advances


---------96:39----------
you can let them know hey


---------96:41----------
you know i'm not quite sure like where


---------96:43----------
this is gonna go because i still feel


---------96:44----------
like


---------96:44----------
pretty hurt and betrayed about like your


---------96:47----------
actions eight months ago


---------96:50----------
you know are we gonna and just state it


---------96:53----------
so this is another thing is like you


---------96:54----------
like i want to teach you a little jiu


---------96:56----------
jitsu trick okay


---------96:58----------
verbal jiu-jitsu which is that you don't


---------96:59----------
ask questions you just make statements


---------97:02----------
and then you just be silent and then you


---------97:04----------
see what they come back with some people


---------97:06----------
may


---------97:06----------
authentically want to repair their


---------97:08----------
relationship with you or they may want


---------97:10----------
to have


---------97:10----------
an authentic conversation about they


---------97:12----------
felt hurt and betrayed about something


---------97:14----------
that you did but then i think you guys


---------97:15----------
should


---------97:16----------
talk about it but the key thing is that


---------97:18----------
when you feel that guilt like


---------97:20----------
don't give in to it don't do the


---------97:23----------
action that alleviates the guilt


---------97:26----------
because that's exactly what your mom


---------97:28----------
taught you to do that gets you into


---------97:29----------
trouble with her


---------97:30----------
because then you you give in to the


---------97:31----------
guilt and then you find yourself in a


---------97:33----------
situation that you detest


---------97:39----------
okay so


---------97:42----------
okay where was i all right so number one


---------97:45----------
you know set boundaries and don't it's


---------97:48----------
actually on you i think you're the one


---------97:49----------
who's lacks on them and you let people


---------97:51----------
get away with it


---------97:52----------
yeah and then they're going to get


---------97:53----------
frustrated so be careful about that


---------97:54----------
guilt early on when you set boundaries


---------97:56----------
work with a therapist or sign up for a


---------97:58----------
coach i think this is definitely the


---------97:59----------
kind of thing that you should work on


---------98:01----------
it's something that our coaches are


---------98:02----------
actually pretty good at um


---------98:05----------
and i think also the two aren't mutually


---------98:07----------
exclusive so about


---------98:10----------
maybe 20 of people who come into


---------98:12----------
coaching


---------98:14----------
wind up with a therapist because our


---------98:15----------
coaches will say hey i really think you


---------98:17----------
should see a therapist


---------98:18----------
you can do both of them if you want to


---------98:19----------
whatever


---------98:21----------
but i really think that you should you


---------98:22----------
know get a therapist


---------98:24----------
or a coach or whatever just get some get


---------98:27----------
someone


---------98:28----------
who owes you nothing right get someone


---------98:32----------
in your life


---------98:33----------
like stephen or it sounds like sometimes


---------98:35----------
your mom is supportive


---------98:36----------
but that's tangled right so like you and


---------98:38----------
stephen are gonna have other kinds of


---------98:40----------
tensions on your relationship


---------98:42----------
it also sounds like for whatever reason


---------98:44----------
you were confiding in bob instead of


---------98:45----------
stephen which sort of makes sense


---------98:47----------
i confide in people that are not my wife


---------98:48----------
because she's my wife


---------98:50----------
she confides in people that are not me


---------98:52----------
because problems in your relationship


---------98:53----------
exactly and then you like


---------98:54----------
to eventually yeah someone that is


---------98:56----------
partner so i think it's going to be very


---------98:58----------
healthy for you to have someone


---------99:00----------
in your life who


---------99:03----------
the boundaries are very clear you don't


---------99:06----------
have to do [ __ ] for them


---------99:08----------
there's no they're not sacrificing any


---------99:10----------
viewership on stream by


---------99:12----------
being your friend or anything like that


---------99:13----------
where there's like one human being


---------99:15----------
in your life that for one hour a week is


---------99:18----------
there for you


---------99:19----------
in whatever you feel yeah


---------99:24----------
yeah sounds good thoughts questions


---------99:30----------
no i think this was really good


---------99:34----------
yeah okay this is yeah it makes me like


---------99:37----------
a little bit more


---------99:41----------
it's very easy like if i talk to stephen


---------99:43----------
about this he would basically just say


---------99:44----------
like don't


---------99:45----------
don't give a [ __ ] about what they think


---------99:46----------
just move on and it's like okay


---------99:49----------
like i was supposed to like i mean i


---------99:51----------
understand what you mean and you're


---------99:52----------
right but like um


---------99:55----------
but it's kind of hard to just like feel


---------99:57----------
that right like it's just hard


---------99:58----------
to do that so it feels good to like have


---------100:00----------
someone explaining to me like how


---------100:03----------
things work then it's easier for me to


---------100:05----------
like understand myself and like know


---------100:07----------
like what to do like you think sounds


---------100:09----------
logical and what you say sounds logical


---------100:11----------
to me


---------100:12----------
yeah well i'm glad you found it useful


---------100:15----------
molina


---------100:15----------
um you know i think but like i'm really


---------100:18----------
hopeful for you for what it's worth i


---------100:20----------
think you


---------100:20----------
you're a very different person than who


---------100:23----------
you were in april


---------100:25----------
i'm sorry yeah


---------100:28----------
interesting you should go watch that


---------100:31----------
interview


---------100:33----------
i hate watching myself i can't do that i


---------100:35----------
hate watching myself too i can't watch


---------100:37----------
it either


---------100:38----------
but anyway i never like if there's like


---------100:42----------
oh no there's a clip of me that's


---------100:43----------
popular like


---------100:44----------
i don't i i can't watch it either i


---------100:47----------
don't give a [ __ ] about what other


---------100:48----------
people think about me like that


---------100:49----------
and i don't really care about hate or


---------100:51----------
anything um but i


---------100:53----------
yeah but i can't i can't watch i can


---------100:55----------
hear my voice and i can't so


---------100:57----------
so i think you've learned how to start


---------100:58----------
putting yourself first and i think it's


---------101:01----------
complicated you may be going too far you


---------101:03----------
may actually because i think there's one


---------101:05----------
last thing that i would mention which is


---------101:06----------
that


---------101:07----------
you know when people dislike you


---------101:10----------
you got to be really careful about these


---------101:12----------
answers like oh it's because they hate


---------101:14----------
me like they may actually have a genuine


---------101:15----------
complaint which may have merit


---------101:18----------
right if people like want to get you


---------101:20----------
cancelled like


---------101:22----------
got to be careful because i'm pretty


---------101:24----------
sure that a lot of people who have


---------101:26----------
gotten cancelled


---------101:27----------
would say the same thing which is like


---------101:28----------
oh haters going to hate they're trying


---------101:30----------
to get me cancelled whereas like some of


---------101:31----------
them are really doing things that are


---------101:33----------
out of line


---------101:34----------
now i can't envision you doing some of


---------101:36----------
the things but like


---------101:37----------
you know there may have there may be a


---------101:39----------
legitimate criticism in there i don't


---------101:40----------
know


---------101:41----------
yeah it's just i it's just i don't know


---------101:44----------
sometimes i just wonder like how people


---------101:46----------
can like i don't know i don't like


---------101:48----------
cancer culture i really don't


---------101:50----------
like that at all i don't like it either


---------101:53----------
but yeah it's really weird it's a really


---------101:55----------
weird thing


---------101:57----------
um i don't know it's really weird


---------102:00----------
the same people do that is it makes me a


---------102:03----------
little sad


---------102:04----------
i think to see that people want to try


---------102:06----------
to do that because


---------102:08----------
the only thing they can see is like


---------102:11----------
they can't really see like what's going


---------102:13----------
on i guess so they can't like have


---------102:15----------
any um they can't really see how the


---------102:18----------
other person is like feeling about


---------102:19----------
anything and they're seeing this like


---------102:21----------
this they're seeing if they try to


---------102:22----------
cancel me they don't seem as a human


---------102:24----------
that's what it feels like yeah and


---------102:26----------
that's as literally


---------102:27----------
really weird because i try to see


---------102:29----------
everyone is like i try to understand


---------102:30----------
everyone you know


---------102:31----------
i try to um that's why i feel also like


---------102:33----------
guilty because i try to like understand


---------102:35----------
all the time like why is this person


---------102:36----------
doing


---------102:37----------
yeah but it's weird to like see that


---------102:40----------
people don't do that


---------102:44----------
yeah i mean i have a weird response to


---------102:47----------
that which is like


---------102:48----------
trying to understand people all the time


---------102:51----------
is


---------102:52----------
being a saint it's not being a human


---------102:56----------
so you should let yourself be human


---------102:59----------
just like just assume the warriors


---------103:02----------
hate them no not assume the worst and


---------103:06----------
hate them but like let yourself feel


---------103:07----------
hatred right because that's human


---------103:10----------
you have parts of your brain that are


---------103:12----------
wired to help you feel hatred


---------103:14----------
and so like let yourself feel the full


---------103:17----------
range of things


---------103:18----------
and that's okay and i think you've been


---------103:21----------
so this is kind of weird but like you


---------103:22----------
know if you take


---------103:23----------
a neutron and then you split it up into


---------103:25----------
a proton and an electron


---------103:27----------
like with that positive charge you


---------103:29----------
create the negative charge


---------103:32----------
and i think for a lot a lot of time


---------103:34----------
molina your positivity is like creating


---------103:36----------
this like


---------103:37----------
karmic negativity on the other side


---------103:41----------
and so you know when you're like way way


---------103:43----------
too positive with people like it winds


---------103:45----------
up with like negative things


---------103:47----------
yeah when you're overly forgiving overly


---------103:50----------
indulgent


---------103:50----------
overly enabling you create little brats


---------103:54----------
as children right if you're like a


---------103:57----------
parent so like just be a little bit


---------103:58----------
aware of that and it's okay to feel


---------104:00----------
hatred it's okay to


---------104:01----------
feel those things don't let them dictate


---------104:03----------
your actions but don't let the guilt or


---------104:05----------
the other the positivity dictate your


---------104:06----------
actions as well


---------104:09----------
hmm yeah it's almost like um


---------104:13----------
interesting wait it's it's a it's like a


---------104:16----------
little bit of the same feeling


---------104:18----------
as like having sex with someone because


---------104:20----------
you feel bad for them


---------104:24----------
it's not good to do that at all because


---------104:26----------
sometimes you feel so bad for someone so


---------104:28----------
you're like oh yeah maybe i can do that


---------104:29----------
like you know like maybe i can just like


---------104:30----------
let him


---------104:31----------
you know that sounds so [ __ ] up but


---------104:34----------
like this is definitely a thing that i


---------104:35----------
think people do


---------104:36----------
no i think it's a it's a good example of


---------104:39----------
you know doing something with good


---------104:40----------
intentions that doesn't end well


---------104:42----------
yeah it's like not good for anyone i


---------104:45----------
think but it's like i don't know um


---------104:48----------
and molina i don't know how to say this


---------104:50----------
but if you're pity [ __ ] people


---------104:51----------
you know that may cause problems in your


---------104:53----------
inner personal life


---------104:55----------
yeah exactly especially with the people


---------104:58----------
that you're pity [ __ ]


---------104:59----------
i'm not doing that i can't believe we've


---------105:02----------
been talking about this for an hour and


---------105:04----------
a half and it comes down to pity [ __ ]


---------105:10----------
not doing that okay good for you yeah


---------105:16----------
all right yeah and on that note


---------105:20----------
no seriously though i think you're i


---------105:22----------
think you've grown a lot i think you


---------105:23----------
still have a lot of growing to do


---------105:25----------
um you know i think it's okay to feel


---------105:27----------
hatred but also to really try to be like


---------105:29----------
reflective of people's criticisms


---------105:32----------
and really try to like find out about


---------105:34----------
this sort of things like early on like


---------105:36----------
i'm only 22.


---------105:37----------
so it's kind of nice to like yeah


---------105:41----------
because i i assume like the


---------105:43----------
channel i mean maybe is this true like


---------105:45----------
the older you get the harder


---------105:47----------
it's going to be to like get out of like


---------105:48----------
old patterns


---------105:51----------
technically yes


---------105:54----------
but in your case you've got eight to ten


---------105:56----------
years after which it gets hard


---------105:58----------
your brain is still pretty malleable for


---------106:00----------
another decade


---------106:01----------
yeah i mean my brain is still growing i


---------106:04----------
guess


---------106:04----------
yep right yeah so maybe it's like good


---------106:08----------
to like find out like old


---------106:09----------
like bad patterns like so i would say


---------106:12----------
technically it does become harder


---------106:13----------
like according to our understanding of


---------106:15----------
neuroscience but practically


---------106:17----------
i've seen people who are 40 50 and 60


---------106:19----------
change


---------106:21----------
a lot yeah like patterns that they've


---------106:24----------
lived with their entire life like


---------106:26----------
turning them around in a year or two


---------106:29----------
that's really nice


---------106:30----------
yeah that's cool that makes me happy to


---------106:31----------
hear yeah okay


---------106:33----------
so um i normally i ask people if they


---------106:36----------
want to meditate but i just don't know


---------106:37----------
what it is about today i don't think i


---------106:39----------
can teach you meditation for which i


---------106:40----------
apologize


---------106:41----------
that's fine if you really really want to


---------106:44----------
learn it i can try to recalibrate myself


---------106:46----------
and see what i can come up with but just


---------106:48----------
something about


---------106:49----------
i don't know what it is i'm just the the


---------106:52----------
parts of my mind that access what


---------106:54----------
meditation is appropriate for people


---------106:56----------
or is like not functioning right now


---------106:59----------
okay


---------107:01----------
i could try to do it if i if i um start


---------107:04----------
talking to someone do they do meditation


---------107:06----------
as well


---------107:06----------
the coaches not much


---------107:10----------
but it's something that we're actually


---------107:11----------
gonna do advanced training for them


---------107:14----------
um now so like they've learned a lot of


---------107:16----------
good stuff but


---------107:17----------
i think the next thing that we're gonna


---------107:18----------
teach them is like more meditation but


---------107:20----------
as healthy gamer we're we're coming up


---------107:21----------
with


---------107:22----------
additional meditation resources yeah i


---------107:24----------
think meditation is so nice i just feel


---------107:26----------
like it's been really hard to like try


---------107:28----------
to do something like that but i remember


---------107:29----------
um there was like i i came to some point


---------107:32----------
in my life where i just felt really


---------107:34----------
really bad and then i just like took two


---------107:35----------
weeks off from everything


---------107:37----------
and the only thing that i did was like


---------107:39----------
moving my body like go on walks


---------107:41----------
go run uh meditated so much


---------107:45----------
did a lot of mushrooms so it was like


---------107:47----------
every i just like completely


---------107:48----------
disconnected from like


---------107:50----------
myself almost and just beca like step


---------107:52----------
out of myself for like two weeks


---------107:53----------
straight


---------107:54----------
and i felt really really good about


---------107:55----------
doing that but it yeah it's hard when it


---------107:58----------
comes to streaming because you feel


---------107:59----------
stressed all the time like even if


---------108:00----------
when you turn off the stream you feel


---------108:02----------
like you're still working you know


---------108:05----------
yeah um okay i remember that


---------108:08----------
that was that was really nice so


---------108:09----------
meditation would be probably really


---------108:11----------
really good


---------108:12----------
yeah yeah i'm sorry i just got nothing


---------108:16----------
i can meditate on my own i think i think


---------108:18----------
okay especially after like


---------108:20----------
hearing you say these things it's like


---------108:21----------
really good for me too yeah because now


---------108:23----------
i feel like you have a bigger


---------108:24----------
understanding


---------108:25----------
and that's really nice yeah okay like


---------108:28----------
i was kind of like stuck in my head and


---------108:30----------
now you kind of like open up like a new


---------108:32----------
path a little bit


---------108:33----------
that's i'm happy to hear that um i hope


---------108:37----------
it's a fruitful path for you to walk


---------108:38----------
down i'm rooting for you


---------108:40----------
i think i i think you're growing more


---------108:42----------
than you give yourself credit


---------108:45----------
and for really nice yeah because i feel


---------108:47----------
like i'm just like


---------108:48----------
like i'm just going down there but maybe


---------108:50----------
like


---------108:51----------
i don't know it's it's cool to hear that


---------108:53----------
you're telling me that


---------108:55----------
i'm like growing but i'm just feeling


---------108:57----------
bad because i'm growing


---------109:00----------
yeah so that's that's the tricky thing


---------109:01----------
right so growing isn't fun


---------109:03----------
like learning isn't fun


---------109:06----------
you know if you think about like a kid


---------109:08----------
who's like throws temper tantrums to get


---------109:10----------
their way


---------109:10----------
and they're learning how to not throw


---------109:12----------
temper tantrums to get their way


---------109:14----------
it's not fun for the kid they want to


---------109:17----------
just throw a temper tantrum and get


---------109:18----------
their way they don't want to like


---------109:19----------
restrain their emotions and


---------109:21----------
and grow so like growth is usually


---------109:23----------
unfortunately painful


---------109:25----------
which is why actually our learning


---------109:27----------
circuitry is very closely tied to our


---------109:29----------
negative emotion circuitry


---------109:31----------
which is why if you like touch a hot pan


---------109:34----------
you'll learn like that


---------109:36----------
right so in a weird way you know but


---------109:39----------
anyway


---------109:40----------
so good luck to you you know keep us


---------109:42----------
posted


---------109:43----------
and um you know if you do decide to go


---------109:45----------
you know definitely worthwhile to see an


---------109:47----------
actual therapist but if you want to


---------109:49----------
take advantage of the coaching program i


---------109:51----------
think i already sent you some


---------109:52----------
information about it but if you run into


---------109:53----------
trouble you can always let us know


---------109:55----------
you can also talk to your twitch account


---------109:56----------
manager about it


---------109:58----------
