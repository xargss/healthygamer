---------00:01----------
wednesday and and asman gold on friday


---------00:04----------
um and today we're gonna be talking with


---------00:07----------
the bjergsen


---------00:09----------
beer the beer


---------00:14----------
bjergson


---------00:17----------
welcome thank you um


---------00:20----------
and what do you what do you go by


---------00:24----------
uh sauron okay sorry that's good


---------00:27----------
and um you know you can call me alok or


---------00:30----------
dr k like


---------00:31----------
you know whatever you prefer okay um


---------00:34----------
yeah so thank you so much for coming on


---------00:36----------
soren how are you doing today


---------00:39----------
i'm good i'm nervous but i'm good i


---------00:42----------
think most people usually are and i i


---------00:44----------
still don't know quite what to do about


---------00:45----------
that


---------00:46----------
um there's only so much you can do i


---------00:49----------
think yeah


---------00:50----------
so what are you nervous about


---------00:54----------
uh just being vulnerable on such an open


---------00:57----------
platform


---------00:58----------
i mean that's the kind of beauty of it


---------00:59----------
but that's also uh


---------01:01----------
i guess what makes me nervous at least


---------01:03----------
yeah and are you planning on being


---------01:05----------
vulnerable today


---------01:08----------
i think it's kind of hard not to be on


---------01:10----------
on your channel from all the talks that


---------01:12----------
i've seen


---------01:13----------
well yeah at the fair point but you know


---------01:15----------
we can help you not be vulnerable if if


---------01:17----------
you don't want to


---------01:18----------
no i mean i think being vulnerable is a


---------01:20----------
it's a good thing it's just a difficult


---------01:22----------
difficult thing


---------01:23----------
absolutely man well said well said um


---------01:26----------
did you have an idea of what you wanted


---------01:27----------
to talk about today


---------01:30----------
uh i have an idea where we can start and


---------01:33----------
then


---------01:33----------
sure i'm happy to go wherever you kind


---------01:37----------
of see the conversation going or any


---------01:39----------
observations that you might have


---------01:40----------
sorry one second so you know yeah


---------01:44----------
so um yeah so what where would you like


---------01:47----------
to start sauron


---------01:50----------
uh it might be hard for me to


---------01:54----------
to kind of vocalize this because i


---------01:55----------
haven't really told anyone but


---------01:57----------
uh so in league of legends whether


---------02:01----------
you're coaching or playing there's a


---------02:02----------
very distinct like on season and off


---------02:03----------
season


---------02:04----------
and people grind really hard in the on


---------02:06----------
season and then


---------02:07----------
[Music]


---------02:09----------
you have a lot of free time sometimes


---------02:10----------
even kind of months so you're not doing


---------02:13----------
where you're not really working and


---------02:17----------
i feel sometimes like i'm two different


---------02:20----------
people


---------02:21----------
especially in terms of uh


---------02:24----------
the things that i really miss in season


---------02:26----------
are the things that i feel like are


---------02:27----------
really different or


---------02:28----------
especially i don't really have a lot of


---------02:31----------
feelings during the season


---------02:32----------
i'm very like robotic uh


---------02:37----------
good things bad things i'm pretty stoic


---------02:40----------
okay uh


---------02:41----------
and and that feels pretty different when


---------02:42----------
i'm off season i'm definitely more in


---------02:44----------
touch with my emotions i feel like


---------02:46----------
okay and the other thing is kind of just


---------02:51----------
creativity i guess or seeing things


---------02:54----------
from a different perspective being more


---------02:57----------
aware of my surroundings and i'm kind of


---------02:58----------
aware of myself even


---------03:01----------
uh in the in the season i feel like that


---------03:03----------
kind of goes away and i'm really just


---------03:05----------
grinding and sometimes i don't really


---------03:06----------
have a good perspective on how to


---------03:08----------
solve issues or see things in a


---------03:10----------
different way


---------03:11----------
and uh i have had that sometimes during


---------03:14----------
the season and i feel like those are


---------03:15----------
kind of some of my best


---------03:17----------
times where i'm able to just be more


---------03:20----------
aware of what i'm doing and how i can


---------03:21----------
kind of optimize


---------03:23----------
the way that i'm living and working and


---------03:25----------
trying to do my job


---------03:26----------
the best that i can okay so let me just


---------03:30----------
um


---------03:31----------
kind of repeat back what i heard make


---------03:32----------
sure we're on the same page


---------03:34----------
um first of all turn this sounds like


---------03:37----------
very


---------03:38----------
intriguing to me i'm i'm i i'm


---------03:42----------
um it seems like an observation


---------03:46----------
that i actually have like imagined very


---------03:49----------
few people actually have the awareness


---------03:50----------
to sort of make


---------03:52----------
um it seems like a very kind of uh


---------03:56----------
it seems like you're aware of your


---------03:58----------
internal environment and how much that


---------04:00----------
can change


---------04:00----------
drastically between the on season and


---------04:02----------
the off season is that a good way to put


---------04:04----------
it


---------04:06----------
and so you've noticed that you have you


---------04:09----------
you maybe


---------04:10----------
don't feel a lot of things during the


---------04:11----------
season and in the off season


---------04:13----------
are we saying that you feel too much or


---------04:15----------
you feel a normal amount or what


---------04:21----------
a normal amount okay i'm not kind of


---------04:23----------
bursting at the seams as soon as the


---------04:25----------
season is over


---------04:25----------
but okay more and more kind of natural


---------04:28----------
things like


---------04:29----------
uh i'm able to kind of cry when it's


---------04:31----------
appropriate during the season


---------04:33----------
i'm kind of very just uh


---------04:36----------
stoic i guess is the word that i would


---------04:38----------
use okay


---------04:39----------
and that you also mentioned something


---------04:41----------
about awareness


---------04:42----------
and how you're able to see things


---------04:44----------
differently during the on season


---------04:46----------
off season and that maybe you're not


---------04:48----------
quite


---------04:49----------
as aware of things during the on season


---------04:52----------
and then you also


---------04:53----------
also said that sometimes when you have


---------04:55----------
been aware during the on season that


---------04:57----------
it's been actually really good


---------05:02----------
can you help me understand that


---------05:05----------
[Music]


---------05:07----------
i think it's just the times where


---------05:10----------
non-season it was really helpful for me


---------05:11----------
it's just really being aware of


---------05:14----------
team dynamics or the issues or how we


---------05:16----------
can improve the way that we are working


---------05:18----------
together or talking to each other or


---------05:21----------
it's obviously really flexible when you


---------05:23----------
are aware of those things


---------05:26----------
but i think a lot of people in the


---------05:30----------
league of legend scene can really


---------05:32----------
well just talking to people they feel


---------05:34----------
like they get really lost in the sauce


---------05:36----------
during the season and they just


---------05:39----------
end up kind of going through in the


---------05:40----------
motions and kind of doing the same


---------05:41----------
things over and over again and then


---------05:42----------
after the season is over it's like wait


---------05:43----------
what i was just doing this thing kind of


---------05:45----------
over and over again and not really


---------05:48----------
um able to reflect and


---------05:51----------
see things from a different perspective


---------05:53----------
and


---------05:54----------
i very much feel that same way i'm


---------05:56----------
noticing that there's a lot of autopilot


---------05:58----------
once the season starts it's just grind


---------06:00----------
grind grind


---------06:03----------
yeah i mean i think in the beginning


---------06:04----------
people are


---------06:06----------
motivated and excited and trying new


---------06:09----------
things and more creative and then kind


---------06:10----------
of as the season goes on as the


---------06:12----------
months of grinding goes on i think it a


---------06:15----------
lot of things become more


---------06:16----------
automated how do you understand why that


---------06:19----------
happens


---------06:23----------
um


---------06:27----------
maybe just a sheer amount of hours i'm


---------06:29----------
not really sure i mean i didn't


---------06:31----------
have a day off from late december till


---------06:37----------
like the second week of april uh of


---------06:40----------
course i had time off and i didn't have


---------06:41----------
a


---------06:42----------
kind of day off to myself so i think


---------06:44----------
obviously the time where you're away


---------06:45----------
from the game and what the time where


---------06:47----------
you're doing different things and away


---------06:48----------
from the team i think that definitely


---------06:49----------
gives you


---------06:50----------
uh kind of a different perspective and


---------06:52----------
more time to self-reflect


---------06:54----------
that sounds insane man yep


---------07:01----------
yeah this may sound like and you know i


---------07:04----------
i don't want to


---------07:05----------
um if we skirt close to anything that


---------07:07----------
could be like


---------07:09----------
you know sharing internal secrets or


---------07:13----------
things like that please steer


---------07:14----------
you know i'm just going to ask you a


---------07:15----------
question just let me know if anything i


---------07:16----------
ask is out of line but


---------07:18----------
how on earth do you not have a day off


---------07:20----------
in four months


---------07:23----------
how does that work why


---------07:27----------
well i think most people do is just i'm


---------07:30----------
the head coach so


---------07:31----------
on the typical off day i'm usually doing


---------07:34----------
i'm usually watching our matches for the


---------07:35----------
weekend and preparing them for


---------07:37----------
our meetings next week i'm having


---------07:38----------
meetings with my staff i'm having


---------07:39----------
meetings with


---------07:40----------
my general manager head of esports and


---------07:42----------
also ceo


---------07:44----------
uh so that's on your off day


---------07:47----------
yeah because it's hard to fit it in on


---------07:49----------
my my birthdays


---------07:52----------
okay well


---------07:55----------
you know sword i i know this may be a


---------07:57----------
little bit different from


---------07:58----------
what you had originally said but i think


---------08:00----------
that may be worth talking about what do


---------08:02----------
you think


---------08:05----------
uh yeah okay i think it could be worth


---------08:08----------
talking about


---------08:09----------
what makes it hard to fit in meetings


---------08:11----------
with your ceo


---------08:13----------
and general manager on your work days


---------08:20----------
no i mean i definitely could in the


---------08:23----------
evening it's just


---------08:24----------
a lot of the time i'm pretty pooped


---------08:27----------
uh just from


---------08:32----------
i think a typical work day we meet up at


---------08:35----------
10


---------08:36----------
and then we're kind of done with team


---------08:37----------
practice around either 6 p.m or maybe 8


---------08:41----------
p.m


---------08:43----------
and then on some days of the week i'm


---------08:44----------
having kind of individual meetings with


---------08:45----------
the players


---------08:46----------
and um


---------08:50----------
the last day of the week going into


---------08:51----------
matches there's also always a lot of


---------08:53----------
prep


---------08:54----------
around kind of different aspects of the


---------08:56----------
game the the opponent the draft


---------08:58----------
and i'm responsible for a lot of that


---------09:00----------
not that prep for the opponents luckily


---------09:01----------
i have a


---------09:02----------
strategy coach that helps with that but


---------09:05----------
um


---------09:06----------
it's just hard if it fit things in and


---------09:09----------
i also need to have a little bit of uh


---------09:11----------
off time obviously on those days or


---------09:13----------
i kind of might lose my mind yup


---------09:16----------
absolutely


---------09:16----------
so let me ask you something what would


---------09:18----------
happen if you missed two hours of team


---------09:20----------
practice on monday


---------09:28----------
monday's actually our day off but yeah


---------09:30----------
on tuesday i don't know


---------09:32----------
what happened because i haven't tried i


---------09:35----------
mean


---------09:36----------
sometimes i do ask my assistant coach to


---------09:38----------
take over for me if i'm just really


---------09:39----------
exhausted or


---------09:41----------
uh if i just want a different


---------09:42----------
perspective see someone else


---------09:44----------
lead meetings and review thoughts


---------09:48----------
i haven't been away from practice at all


---------09:52----------
what keeps you so close to practiced


---------10:01----------
i mean i'm a new coach this is my first


---------10:03----------
five months of coaching so i feel like


---------10:06----------
i have a lot of catching up to do and


---------10:10----------
i


---------10:14----------
um yeah i just feel like i guess i need


---------10:17----------
to work harder than everyone else


---------10:18----------
because i'm so new in coaching but


---------10:22----------
i still want my team to do i don't want


---------10:25----------
to hold my team back


---------10:27----------
so i guess i just want to make the most


---------10:30----------
of every


---------10:31----------
opportunity to learn and grow and become


---------10:33----------
better


---------10:36----------
what she's looking for


---------10:40----------
oh sorry okay [ __ ]


---------10:44----------
you're damn right [ __ ]


---------10:48----------
okay so let's let's unpack this a little


---------10:50----------
bit okay


---------10:52----------
so sorry if did i just make you nervous


---------10:54----------
by smiling and saying you're damn right


---------10:56----------
[ __ ]


---------10:59----------
no i mean i i know i definitely have a


---------11:00----------
little bit of a


---------11:03----------
maybe toxic productivity kind of mindset


---------11:07----------
tell me what okay what do you mean by


---------11:10----------
toxic productivity mindset can you help


---------11:12----------
us understand that phrase


---------11:23----------
[Music]


---------11:28----------
i don't really know how to okay let's


---------11:31----------
phrase it okay


---------11:32----------
okay yeah is it okay if we dig into this


---------11:35----------
today


---------11:36----------
yeah okay um i'm gonna ask you that


---------11:39----------
question two or three more times because


---------11:41----------
i suspect


---------11:42----------
that we're going to get to feelings that


---------11:44----------
may feel


---------11:45----------
actually uncomfortable and and my


---------11:48----------
concern is that you have such a


---------11:50----------
toxic productivity and growth oriented


---------11:52----------
mindset that even if things are


---------11:53----------
uncomfortable


---------11:54----------
you'll never say no


---------11:59----------
well a big part of why i'm even here is


---------12:01----------
that the


---------12:02----------
i'm just trying to get outside my


---------12:03----------
comfort zone more okay and i guess


---------12:05----------
because you're trying to grow


---------12:06----------
[Laughter]


---------12:12----------
ain't nobody got time for that that's


---------12:14----------
what i'm saying


---------12:15----------
you know gotta grow whatever the cost to


---------12:17----------
you


---------12:20----------
a little bit okay i think that's what


---------12:24----------
that's what toxic toxic productivity


---------12:26----------
i've never heard that phrase before but


---------12:27----------
i i think it's well said


---------12:29----------
coined well so let's start with this


---------12:31----------
okay


---------12:32----------
i'm gonna lay things out and then we're


---------12:33----------
gonna explore and what i the reason i'm


---------12:35----------
gonna lay things out is because um


---------12:39----------
i'm imagining that there's a part of


---------12:41----------
your mind that's really really concerned


---------12:43----------
about like stepping into


---------12:45----------
a trap of some kind you mentioned you


---------12:49----------
are nervous i think you have


---------12:50----------
you're going to have a tendency to set


---------12:52----------
aside your own feelings for the sake of


---------12:54----------
growth


---------12:54----------
so i'm going to try to alleviate this a


---------12:56----------
little bit it's not usually how i work


---------12:58----------
usually we'll have the revelation at the


---------12:59----------
end


---------13:00----------
but i'm just going to give it to you


---------13:01----------
anticlimactically at the beginning and


---------13:03----------
then we're going to explore it


---------13:04----------
and the reason i'm gonna do that is that


---------13:05----------
i hope it'll put your mind a little bit


---------13:07----------
at ease


---------13:09----------
okay okay so the first thing is that


---------13:13----------
you know i've seen this a lot so i've


---------13:15----------
worked with a fair number of esports


---------13:16----------
organizations before


---------13:17----------
and and not just esports but basically


---------13:19----------
any


---------13:20----------
high performing top tier like 0.1


---------13:24----------
organization you go to so i've seen this


---------13:26----------
at places like harvard business school


---------13:29----------
i've seen it at hospital systems you


---------13:31----------
know tech companies um


---------13:34----------
there's this idea that more is better


---------13:37----------
so for example like in residency


---------13:39----------
training like we we do like 24-hour


---------13:41----------
calls we do 30-hour calls


---------13:43----------
there's this kind of this idea that like


---------13:46----------
you know if you work 80 hours a week or


---------13:48----------
a hunt working 100 hours a week


---------13:51----------
is better than working 80 hours a week


---------13:54----------
you know that that like work like


---------13:56----------
working more is better


---------13:58----------
and and i've i've struggled a lot to


---------13:59----------
sort of like


---------14:01----------
get people to experiment with this and


---------14:03----------
i'd say the the


---------14:04----------
hardest uphill climb i've ever had to


---------14:06----------
make which i failed to make


---------14:08----------
was working with a korean overwatch team


---------14:11----------
and that's gonna be a challenge and they


---------14:13----------
just didn't


---------14:14----------
like accept that working less could lead


---------14:17----------
to better results


---------14:20----------
and and this is where and i've managed


---------14:23----------
to convince some people


---------14:24----------
that actually like you know rather than


---------14:26----------
doing team practice for 12 hours a day


---------14:28----------
or eight hours a day


---------14:29----------
that doing team practice for like four


---------14:31----------
hours six hours a day and doing like


---------14:34----------
an hour of meditation and yoga and an


---------14:36----------
hour of like


---------14:37----------
something else actually leads to like


---------14:39----------
better outcomes


---------14:41----------
than just grinding what do you think


---------14:42----------
about that


---------14:48----------
i think one of the most difficult things


---------14:50----------
about the game that


---------14:52----------
i was playing professionally for a long


---------14:54----------
time and i'm coaching is that it changes


---------14:56----------
a lot


---------14:57----------
that really rewards the grinders because


---------14:58----------
the game is always changing a lot so you


---------15:00----------
always need to adapt and


---------15:01----------
figure out what's strong what counters


---------15:03----------
this new thing that's strong


---------15:04----------
this thing that was powerful it's now


---------15:06----------
been made maybe five percent ten percent


---------15:08----------
weaker is it still viable


---------15:10----------
which situations is it viable uh so it


---------15:13----------
really rewards grinders and honestly the


---------15:14----------
biggest grinders


---------15:17----------
are the most successful in league of


---------15:18----------
legends okay um


---------15:20----------
so it definitely it does require putting


---------15:23----------
a lot of hours but


---------15:24----------
of course up until a certain point um


---------15:27----------
yeah so so and this is where ultimately


---------15:31----------
you're the expert here right because i


---------15:33----------
don't know


---------15:34----------
how many hours of grinding before you


---------15:36----------
start hitting diminishing returns


---------15:38----------
it's generally speaking been my


---------15:40----------
experience that people tend to


---------15:42----------
overemphasize grinding


---------15:44----------
and and i i don't know really to i mean


---------15:48----------
and each esport is different but it's


---------15:50----------
been my experience that


---------15:51----------
most of the time like in 80


---------15:54----------
of the esports orgs i've worked with


---------15:57----------
that de-emphasizing grinding


---------15:59----------
usually leads to better performance that


---------16:02----------
being thoughtful


---------16:03----------
it doesn't mean that you're not thinking


---------16:05----------
about the game it's just being


---------16:07----------
thoughtful about your practice is


---------16:08----------
actually better than like grinding


---------16:11----------
yeah um but that's not where we're gonna


---------16:15----------
go


---------16:15----------
what we're gonna go then what i would


---------16:17----------
say when i was a player is


---------16:19----------
why can't i be thoughtful while grinding


---------16:21----------
yeah okay


---------16:22----------
there it is okay so so so wha


---------16:25----------
why would you say that as a player


---------16:28----------
where does that come from um because


---------16:30----------
that that sounds like


---------16:32----------
the best of both worlds you're kind of


---------16:34----------
getting all the benefits right


---------16:36----------
be more deliberate in your practice but


---------16:37----------
also shooting for the best


---------16:40----------
yeah okay so but what we're going to


---------16:42----------
talk about is


---------16:44----------
you feel like you have a lot of catching


---------16:46----------
up to do


---------16:50----------
long have you felt that way


---------16:54----------
wow uh


---------16:58----------
in general i assume you mean more in


---------17:00----------
general yeah


---------17:02----------
um


---------17:05----------
now we're hitting the the big stuff


---------17:08----------
i don't know if it's the big stuff but


---------17:10----------
uh it's pretty public i made a facebook


---------17:12----------
post many years ago that i was


---------17:14----------
bullied really heavily in school from


---------17:16----------
fourth grade to


---------17:19----------
eighth grade when i actually dropped out


---------17:20----------
of school and


---------17:23----------
dropping out of school kind of caused me


---------17:24----------
to play a lot more video games which


---------17:26----------
somehow turned into a job which somehow


---------17:28----------
brought me where i am now


---------17:30----------
so i was really fortunate in that sense


---------17:33----------
but


---------17:34----------
i was kind of in and out of school


---------17:39----------
for i can't remember how long because


---------17:43----------
honestly a lot of my young past is kind


---------17:45----------
of a blur


---------17:46----------
at this point but i was in my own school


---------17:49----------
for a long time


---------17:51----------
i pretty much didn't leave my room i


---------17:52----------
didn't see anyone outside of my


---------17:54----------
family and had a lot of anxiety


---------17:58----------
interacting with other people and


---------18:02----------
even when i started going to esports


---------18:04----------
tournaments i felt


---------18:05----------
just like very underdeveloped for my age


---------18:08----------
and even coming to the us here when i


---------18:10----------
was 17 18


---------18:12----------
i wasn't really able to upkeep a


---------18:14----------
conversation with another person


---------18:16----------
uh the only thing i really knew was the


---------18:19----------
game and that's what i


---------18:20----------
dove into uh and i think at that point i


---------18:23----------
definitely felt like


---------18:25----------
i'm uh


---------18:28----------
i guess undeveloped underdeveloped for


---------18:30----------
my age like my life skills my social


---------18:31----------
skills


---------18:32----------
these kinds of things and


---------18:35----------
it was super uncomfortable but i just


---------18:37----------
tried to


---------18:39----------
still spend a lot of time with people


---------18:40----------
and


---------18:42----------
learn how to be a normal person screw


---------18:44----------
your feelings right


---------18:47----------
um


---------18:48----------
[Music]


---------18:53----------
i don't know that's a difficult one i


---------18:56----------
mean


---------18:56----------
when when i was


---------18:59----------
listening to my feelings when i was


---------19:01----------
depressed they were just telling me


---------19:03----------
don't see other people stay in your room


---------19:06----------
play video games all day


---------19:08----------
uh and it was really when i


---------19:12----------
i guess


---------19:18----------
just really got outside my comfort zone


---------19:19----------
i went to an esports event in sweden


---------19:22----------
met a bunch of other met my teammates in


---------19:24----------
person which is really terrifying


---------19:25----------
because i was


---------19:27----------
really deeply insecure um


---------19:30----------
but then my team got top eight i think


---------19:32----------
and then we actually qualified


---------19:33----------
for the lcs when lcs was starting back


---------19:35----------
in season three so this is


---------19:37----------
maybe eight years ago so we qualify for


---------19:39----------
lcs and then that


---------19:41----------
really got me the job as an esports


---------19:42----------
player so


---------19:45----------
so you have to work harder than everyone


---------19:50----------
else


---------19:54----------
yeah i think i always felt that way i


---------19:56----------
never felt like i was


---------19:59----------
super intrinsically talented


---------20:03----------
i always felt like a lot of my skill


---------20:04----------
came from


---------20:06----------
my work ethic i think that's certainly


---------20:09----------
true


---------20:10----------
by the way i loved your answer to screw


---------20:12----------
your feelings because you were like


---------20:13----------
it's tough because sometimes my feelings


---------20:15----------
tell me to stay in my room and


---------20:17----------
not interact with anyone and you've had


---------20:20----------
to learn how to master your feelings at


---------20:22----------
times


---------20:23----------
yeah they still do tell me that


---------20:25----------
sometimes


---------20:28----------
wow okay and then you also said i don't


---------20:31----------
want to hold everyone back


---------20:38----------
can you tell me um


---------20:38----------
[Music]


---------20:42----------
yeah i mean i think the natural


---------20:43----------
progression of a coach is kind of to


---------20:45----------
start


---------20:45----------
coaching maybe individual players and


---------20:47----------
then maybe coaching an amateur or


---------20:49----------
academy team but i went straight from


---------20:51----------
playing lcs to coaching kind of a


---------20:54----------
top-tier multi-million dollar team so i


---------20:58----------
just don't want to


---------21:01----------
hold them back with my inexperience do


---------21:04----------
you feel


---------21:04----------
underdeveloped


---------21:06----------
[Laughter]


---------21:09----------
um


---------21:15----------
do i feel underdeveloped


---------21:19----------
um


---------21:23----------
i feel like i don't have a ton of


---------21:24----------
experience yet i would say


---------21:29----------
so does that kind of answer your


---------21:30----------
question or does it not i think it's uh


---------21:33----------
it's a very artful dodge


---------21:35----------
that could be an answer if i wanted to


---------21:37----------
accept it as one


---------21:38----------
and and i'm not i'm not you know if it's


---------21:41----------
an answer it's an answer


---------21:43----------
so if your answer is no i don't feel


---------21:45----------
underdeveloped


---------21:46----------
what i feel is inexperienced and there's


---------21:48----------
a difference


---------21:49----------
because i think the other challenge here


---------21:51----------
is soren is that


---------21:53----------
i think that yeah what would you say to


---------21:56----------
that


---------21:58----------
i just don't understand the the


---------22:00----------
difference between the two


---------22:01----------
okay inexperienced and underdeveloped


---------22:04----------
okay


---------22:04----------
you would say that those are the same


---------22:06----------
thing


---------22:08----------
uh in this coaching case i i definitely


---------22:12----------
will develop with experience


---------22:14----------
of course it's not the only thing but


---------22:16----------
yeah yeah


---------22:18----------
so here's my concern


---------22:21----------
is that as long as you feel like you


---------22:24----------
have catching up to do


---------22:26----------
you're going to act in a way that


---------22:28----------
alleviates those feelings


---------22:31----------
and the challenge is that there may come


---------22:35----------
a time where you have caught up


---------22:37----------
but just because you've technically


---------22:40----------
caught up


---------22:41----------
may not actually have anything to do


---------22:42----------
with the feeling of having caught up


---------22:48----------
and and i i'm curious also


---------22:53----------
yeah you don't really know when you've


---------22:54----------
caught up because you i also don't


---------22:56----------
really see other


---------23:00----------
yeah i mean it's just a hard thing it's


---------23:01----------
not a very linear thing like oh now i've


---------23:03----------
caught up now i have these skills


---------23:05----------
exactly so i i see you putting yourself


---------23:08----------
into like an unwinnable proposition


---------23:11----------
because you're never gonna know whether


---------23:13----------
you've caught up or not and you're gonna


---------23:15----------
be like


---------23:15----------
driving yourself forward because you


---------23:17----------
feel like you need to catch up


---------23:20----------
and even though and i know this sounds


---------23:22----------
weird so like sometimes certain people


---------23:24----------
who have your your complex for lack of a


---------23:28----------
better term


---------23:28----------
you know these people who feel like


---------23:30----------
they're under developed feel like they


---------23:32----------
have to work really bad i mean really


---------23:34----------
hard


---------23:34----------
feel like they've fallen behind they


---------23:37----------
will


---------23:38----------
like work so hard that they'll actually


---------23:42----------
rise i know this sounds absolutely crazy


---------23:44----------
they'll rise to the top of their field


---------23:46----------
and sometimes even in video gaming for


---------23:48----------
example


---------23:49----------
are like 20 million players in this game


---------23:51----------
called league of legends


---------23:52----------
and they'll actually rise to a top tier


---------23:55----------
team in a professional


---------23:56----------
league of legends capacity and they


---------23:58----------
still feel like they have catching up to


---------24:00----------
do


---------24:00----------
i know it sounds absolutely crazy


---------24:05----------
no


---------24:08----------
right so what does catching up look like


---------24:12----------
[Music]


---------24:15----------
can i ask is that such a bad feeling to


---------24:18----------
have or do you just think


---------24:19----------
it's kind of a deep-seated uh


---------24:24----------
like you don't you don't ever feel like


---------24:25----------
you're enough it's not kind of the


---------24:28----------
is that how you feel like you never feel


---------24:29----------
like you're enough


---------24:34----------
[Music]


---------24:41----------
i i don't ever think that but if i think


---------24:44----------
that i can always grow


---------24:46----------
maybe yep well said right


---------24:50----------
so so i i'm not hearing that you really


---------24:53----------
i don't have really


---------24:54----------
negative self thoughts like i'm like i'm


---------24:55----------
not enough but i do have like oh i need


---------24:57----------
to be better


---------24:58----------
yeah that's kind of what i think a lot


---------25:01----------
yeah so so i think that that's a very


---------25:05----------
very good


---------25:06----------
new man you're very nuanced soren so


---------25:08----------
there's there's a there's a


---------25:10----------
there's a new there's a important


---------25:12----------
difference between i'm not


---------25:14----------
good and i could be better


---------25:17----------
right i suspect that those are two sides


---------25:21----------
of the same coin


---------25:22----------
and i think that always striving to be


---------25:25----------
better


---------25:26----------
can come from a dissatisfaction with who


---------25:28----------
you are


---------25:31----------
i personally think that's what you've


---------25:32----------
got down there i think you've just


---------25:35----------
you've just put such positive psychology


---------25:38----------
language around it


---------25:39----------
like you just talk about growth but like


---------25:44----------
i do think that there's fear and other


---------25:47----------
negative emotion like i don't want to


---------25:48----------
hold everyone back


---------25:50----------
implies to me that if i really had to


---------25:53----------
guess what i'd say is that


---------25:54----------
in your mind you're afraid that you will


---------25:57----------
hold everyone back


---------25:58----------
and that's why you have to work harder


---------26:00----------
than everyone else because your


---------26:01----------
teammates don't deserve


---------26:03----------
to have someone like you hold them back


---------26:05----------
they deserve


---------26:06----------
to have someone who can really like live


---------26:09----------
up to expectations


---------26:10----------
and like be the coach that your team


---------26:12----------
needs and the coach that your team


---------26:14----------
deserves


---------26:14----------
and you're going to work really hard to


---------26:16----------
be that thing


---------26:20----------
but i think that there's still a


---------26:21----------
fundamental like fear


---------26:23----------
underneath there that you're like you


---------26:26----------
have to work really hard because


---------26:28----------
deep down if you just auto pilot it it's


---------26:31----------
not gonna be enough


---------26:36----------
um yeah so then you asked me the


---------26:40----------
question


---------26:40----------
is that necessarily bad because i seem


---------26:43----------
to be placing a judgment on it


---------26:46----------
what do you think


---------26:50----------
um


---------27:04----------
i guess


---------27:13----------
maybe this is not what you're asking but


---------27:14----------
i guess i feel like a lot of the time


---------27:16----------
the way that i


---------27:17----------
spend my life or live my life on


---------27:19----------
autopilot


---------27:22----------
uh just doesn't really make me happy i


---------27:25----------
think


---------27:28----------
i think i think i think i waste it's


---------27:31----------
uh i get like sucked into things very


---------27:34----------
easily like social media and obviously


---------27:36----------
those are


---------27:36----------
built to be addicting but uh


---------27:40----------
if i wasn't kind of pushing myself to be


---------27:43----------
a better person and to


---------27:45----------
live life more intentionally and use my


---------27:48----------
time wisely


---------27:50----------
that's why i have this stupid skull


---------27:52----------
because it reminds me that i don't live


---------27:53----------
forever and i try to make the most of


---------27:55----------
of my days it's a little bit more of a


---------27:57----------
time within my room but


---------27:59----------
it does help me especially when i have a


---------28:02----------
hard time getting up in the morning


---------28:03----------
but why do you have to make the most of


---------28:06----------
your days


---------28:18----------
why do i have to make the most out of my


---------28:20----------
days


---------28:28----------
i think it just makes me feel fulfilled


---------28:36----------
and it's not like all i do is work right


---------28:40----------
it's even just uh


---------28:48----------
being more intentional about even like


---------28:50----------
spending time with other people


---------28:51----------
i think when i live life very much on


---------28:53----------
autopilot i also isolate myself


---------28:55----------
a lot i'm definitely


---------28:59----------
pretty introverted and if i'm not kind


---------29:01----------
of


---------29:03----------
making myself get out there then i


---------29:07----------
isolate myself very much


---------29:12----------
can i think for a second sure take your


---------29:24----------
time


---------29:31----------
can you tell me about bullying


---------29:36----------
tell you about bullying what do you want


---------29:38----------
to know


---------29:39----------
so you mentioned that you dropped out of


---------29:41----------
school in fourth grade


---------29:43----------
eighth grade eighth grade so can you


---------29:45----------
tell me about


---------29:46----------
what what happened between fourth grade


---------29:48----------
and eighth grade what school was like


---------29:49----------
for you


---------29:51----------
uh it was


---------29:58----------
really bad uh


---------30:01----------
looking back i don't know i don't know


---------30:05----------
how hard i was being singled out


---------30:06----------
compared to kind of how sensitive


---------30:08----------
i was because my my parents always told


---------30:11----------
me that i was a very sensitive kid


---------30:13----------
especially compared to my brothers


---------30:16----------
but i felt very singled out by some


---------30:18----------
people in my class


---------30:20----------
by my teacher at the time


---------30:23----------
i felt like he was uh


---------30:28----------
somewhat bullying me or singling me out


---------30:31----------
uh but of course i was a kid so i don't


---------30:34----------
know how much that is true but that was


---------30:35----------
very much


---------30:36----------
my reality what do you remember


---------30:50----------
don't remember too much to be honest


---------30:54----------
i remember more so like in eighth grade


---------30:55----------
when people would


---------30:57----------
uh when the bus was coming like steal my


---------31:00----------
backpack


---------31:01----------
and hold it until the bus left so i


---------31:02----------
would have to go home without my


---------31:04----------
backpack or i would have to stay and


---------31:05----------
then


---------31:06----------
i would end up walking home a lot but


---------31:08----------
it's like


---------31:09----------
uh it's like a five mile walk or


---------31:12----------
something for my walk


---------31:14----------
um and


---------31:18----------
just being bullied a lot for being


---------31:19----------
skinny especially


---------31:21----------
i was a really really skinny and short


---------31:23----------
kid so bullied a lot for my body weight


---------31:28----------
my school was kind of up against the


---------31:30----------
kindergarten so they would throw me into


---------31:32----------
the kindergarten because they said i


---------31:34----------
i looked like a kid in kindergarten


---------31:36----------
because i was small and skinny


---------31:38----------
that was really [ __ ] painful at the


---------31:40----------
time for sure


---------31:44----------
underdeveloped oh


---------31:48----------
hey look i was full circle i tried to


---------31:51----------
map things out for you so i didn't i


---------31:53----------
didn't spring it on you bro you know


---------31:56----------
uh-huh that's right i didn't even i


---------31:58----------
didn't even realize that i was talking


---------31:59----------
about it


---------32:02----------
yeah i'm just gonna cry quietly to


---------32:04----------
myself for a second okay


---------32:07----------
um yeah let me ask you what


---------32:11----------
what uh


---------32:14----------
all right soren we're just getting


---------32:16----------
started buddy so


---------32:18----------
when when this thing happened with the


---------32:19----------
backpack like what did your


---------32:22----------
did you tell anyone


---------32:26----------
hmm


---------32:34----------
i don't think so


---------32:37----------
because that was in eighth grade so


---------32:41----------
i think back in sixth seventh fifth


---------32:44----------
grade


---------32:45----------
i would tell my parents and then they


---------32:47----------
would wanna contact the school contact


---------32:49----------
the principal contact their parents


---------32:51----------
and of course when you're a young kid


---------32:53----------
you care a lot about being cool and


---------32:56----------
i was always the kid who


---------33:00----------
so that's kind of like the popular group


---------33:01----------
of kids and i would always try to tag


---------33:03----------
along but i was never really a part of


---------33:04----------
of that circle


---------33:06----------
so i would be the kid that's getting


---------33:08----------
picked on in the popular circle


---------33:10----------
uh but i so desperately wanted to be a


---------33:13----------
part of that circle so i didn't want


---------33:16----------
my parents to talk to their parents and


---------33:17----------
and obviously


---------33:19----------
it's really silly now but at the time


---------33:22----------
it's to social status is really


---------33:24----------
important


---------33:29----------
doesn't sound silly to me


---------33:34----------
well i think if i was who i am now i


---------33:36----------
would just


---------33:37----------
there's a lot of kids at the school try


---------33:38----------
to find people who okay


---------33:41----------
accept me and that i could get along


---------33:42----------
with you don't have to be a part of the


---------33:43----------
most


---------33:44----------
popular clique in the school sure


---------33:47----------
well in that sense i think i would have


---------33:49----------
done better if i was i definitely


---------33:51----------
admired the kids


---------33:52----------
who you know kids would get picked on


---------33:55----------
for drawing


---------33:56----------
or for doing things that were considered


---------33:59----------
nerdy but they were really


---------34:03----------
they knew what they liked and they knew


---------34:04----------
the kind of people that they were


---------34:07----------
and i guess i was more so just trying to


---------34:09----------
fit in


---------34:10----------
so in hindsight as i got older i had a


---------34:14----------
lot of risk


---------34:14----------
i have a lot of respect for those kids


---------34:16----------
who


---------34:18----------
are able to be true to themselves and


---------34:20----------
what they enjoy even though it's not


---------34:21----------
cool or it's not what


---------34:22----------
most people like to do


---------34:28----------
and and i know this is going to be


---------34:29----------
bouncing what what


---------34:32----------
oh is this funny when you when you smile


---------34:34----------
i feel like you're


---------34:35----------
like oh okay this makes a lot of sense


---------34:40----------
what do you think is going on in my head


---------34:42----------
right now


---------34:43----------
um


---------34:47----------
i don't know okay i can't really tell


---------34:49----------
you


---------34:50----------
um


---------34:56----------
do you like being fulfilled


---------35:03----------
um


---------35:12----------
this feels like a trick question but


---------35:17----------
um


---------35:23----------
yeah okay it really wasn't a trick


---------35:27----------
question it was just sort of a


---------35:29----------
um you know i know it's certainly i can


---------35:31----------
see what you mean in terms of i'm trying


---------35:32----------
to i'm trying to let you know well in


---------35:34----------
advance before i lay out a trap for you


---------35:36----------
okay


---------35:36----------
okay um but


---------35:41----------
yeah okay how would you feel if i if i


---------35:44----------
could give you a pill that would make


---------35:46----------
you content


---------35:47----------
would you take it


---------35:54----------
actually that's a bad question but but


---------35:57----------
let's just hear your answer anyway


---------36:09----------
i feel like of course you would want to


---------36:10----------
say yes but i guess i'm worried that


---------36:17----------
it's a complicated question yeah


---------36:21----------
what's complicated about it


---------36:25----------
because of course you want to be sorry


---------36:27----------
what is the word content


---------36:30----------
uh but


---------36:34----------
i guess i just worry that i i might


---------36:38----------
kind of let myself go but also does that


---------36:40----------
really matter if i'm just content


---------36:42----------
but then i would probably also die young


---------36:44----------
because i would just


---------36:48----------
not exercise and not do these kinds of


---------36:49----------
things that are going to make me a


---------36:50----------
healthier person but


---------36:51----------
i'm definitely overthinking the question


---------36:55----------
nope i don't think you are i think


---------36:58----------
you're


---------36:59----------
i don't really know i can't tell you you


---------37:01----------
may be underdeveloped in many ways soren


---------37:03----------
but i don't think you're underdeveloped


---------37:05----------
in your thinking


---------37:06----------
i think you're a very precise thinker so


---------37:10----------
i've got kind of a fork in the road one


---------37:14----------
is you know we can get more to what i'm


---------37:16----------
pretty sure


---------37:17----------
is some sense of okay here's here's what


---------37:19----------
i'm hearing okay


---------37:21----------
so i'm gonna try to once again avoid


---------37:22----------
pits


---------37:25----------
but i'm detecting what i will call pit


---------37:27----------
soren


---------37:28----------
so there's like a sauron who's like


---------37:30----------
stuck in a pit


---------37:32----------
and this is the soren that maybe was


---------37:33----------
bullied maybe dropped out maybe was


---------37:36----------
isolated maybe felt


---------37:37----------
underdeveloped you know like you were


---------37:39----------
kind of in this dark place


---------37:41----------
and like it was really hard to like be


---------37:44----------
you and i think that like on paper


---------37:47----------
you've crawled out of there right like i


---------37:49----------
mean here you are


---------37:50----------
head coach of of a very popular league


---------37:52----------
of legends team


---------37:53----------
you know you have a a pretty star like a


---------37:57----------
pretty respectable


---------37:58----------
professional career behind you you've


---------38:00----------
clearly landed on your feet you've gotta


---------38:03----------
you know you're rocking a pretty awesome


---------38:05----------
beard um


---------38:06----------
you know there are a lot of things about


---------38:08----------
you that are like you can really be


---------38:10----------
proud of


---------38:12----------
and yet you don't strike me as someone


---------38:14----------
who's like


---------38:16----------
and i think this is where things get


---------38:17----------
really tricky because i think you are


---------38:19----------
proud of what you've done i think you


---------38:21----------
have grown you have matured and i


---------38:23----------
genuinely don't believe that like


---------38:26----------
you know i think you really do


---------38:26----------
appreciate that but then you've got that


---------38:29----------
skull in the back of your room and


---------38:33----------
and then like you know it's one thing to


---------38:37----------
want to live every day to your fullest


---------38:40----------
but you have this weird thing where you


---------38:42----------
need a reminder


---------38:44----------
and you need a graphic reminder because


---------38:47----------
what i see in that skull


---------38:48----------
is like a fear that unless like if you


---------38:52----------
ever slow down you're gonna be back to


---------38:54----------
pitsoren


---------38:55----------
that you've climbed fully out of the pit


---------38:58----------
but you need reminders


---------39:01----------
to keep you striving


---------39:04----------
and this is where you kind of say like


---------39:05----------
is that a bad thing is like feeling like


---------39:08----------
you're not good enough or wanting to


---------39:09----------
grow i think you've cloaked it in


---------39:11----------
positivity


---------39:13----------
it's absolutely adaptive it's absolutely


---------39:16----------
responsible


---------39:17----------
for your success


---------39:20----------
but there's a fundamental lack of


---------39:22----------
fulfillment there like that that can't


---------39:23----------
exist with fulfillment


---------39:25----------
and any time you start to feel fulfilled


---------39:27----------
i think you look at your skull over


---------39:28----------
there and it reminds you that


---------39:30----------
you're gonna die one day so better start


---------39:31----------
feeling unfulfilled because it's time to


---------39:33----------
grow


---------39:35----------
like we've got a lot of growing to do


---------39:38----------
and like we can't stop growing not even


---------39:40----------
for a single day heaven forbid that i


---------39:42----------
take a day off in four months


---------39:45----------
because i have so i would like to


---------39:49----------
yep i i think you would so what gets in


---------39:52----------
the way


---------40:05----------
uh i a lot of it is just my work


---------40:07----------
schedule so i think i wouldn't be


---------40:09----------
able to give you much more than a


---------40:11----------
practical answer


---------40:12----------
no but that's an impractical that's not


---------40:14----------
a because your work schedule


---------40:17----------
is determined i think right so this is


---------40:19----------
where like i'm going to toss out a


---------40:20----------
hypothesis usually i wait for hypotheses


---------40:23----------
hypothesis formation at the end but i


---------40:24----------
think it comes back to this feeling like


---------40:26----------
you have a lot of catching up to do


---------40:31----------
right so like you can't afford to take a


---------40:33----------
day off


---------40:34----------
that's what i if i had to piece things


---------40:36----------
together that's what i would


---------40:38----------
think based on what you've said is that


---------40:40----------
you don't have the luxury of a day off


---------40:47----------
[Music]


---------40:49----------
partially i think also just


---------40:56----------
at least this is what my kind of


---------40:58----------
ex-girlfriend told me that


---------41:01----------
being a head coach is a very very time


---------41:03----------
consuming job and if you want to be good


---------41:04----------
you do have to put a lot of time into it


---------41:06----------
and maybe it's more so that


---------41:07----------
the kind of person i am i found myself


---------41:09----------
coming into this


---------41:10----------
role does that make sense so i found


---------41:13----------
myself coming into this job that


---------41:14----------
maybe fulfills this drive or insecurity


---------41:18----------
that i have


---------41:19----------
what do you think about that


---------41:23----------
[Music]


---------41:29----------
there might be some truth to it i mean i


---------41:32----------
i enjoy responsibility


---------41:34----------
for sure and


---------41:37----------
you have a lot of responsibility as a


---------41:38----------
head coach


---------41:43----------
yeah it's interesting to think that you


---------41:44----------
know you picked a job that will always


---------41:46----------
make you feel like you have more


---------41:48----------
to do yep is that sort of the


---------41:51----------
implication


---------41:52----------
that that your ex-girlfriend was making


---------41:56----------
yep how do you feel about that


---------42:00----------
um


---------42:06----------
maybe but i don't really see playing as


---------42:09----------
too different i always had that


---------42:11----------
mentality when i was a player that


---------42:12----------
there's


---------42:13----------
always more that i can do um


---------42:17----------
but of course i i tried to balance that


---------42:19----------
as well with


---------42:20----------
other maybe things that are healthier


---------42:22----------
for me


---------42:24----------
yeah i wasn't just playing 14 hours a


---------42:25----------
day so so let me ask you this do you


---------42:27----------
feel


---------42:28----------
underdeveloped in other areas of your


---------42:42----------
life


---------42:49----------
yeah i would say so like what


---------43:01----------
or i'm kind of unsure about it if you


---------43:03----------
asked me


---------43:04----------
years ago i would say yes but now i


---------43:07----------
i think i realize a little bit more that


---------43:10----------
a lot of adults


---------43:11----------
or mid-20s people are kind of winging it


---------43:13----------
and they don't


---------43:14----------
well set uh whereas uh


---------43:20----------
i definitely have an issue of kind of


---------43:21----------
comparing myself to others


---------43:24----------
okay thinking that they have their [ __ ]


---------43:27----------
together and i


---------43:28----------
don't i think that kind of goes back to


---------43:32----------
this like idea that we were touching on


---------43:33----------
earlier that like


---------43:35----------
i think you've started to realize that


---------43:37----------
you may not actually be underdeveloped


---------43:39----------
but you carry that feeling with you


---------43:47----------
yeah so you mentioned earlier that you


---------43:51----------
felt like sort of behind socially too


---------43:53----------
maybe around eighth grade or after you


---------43:55----------
dropped out of school or when you met


---------43:57----------
your teammates that you felt like very


---------43:58----------
nervous


---------44:01----------
do you can you tell me a little bit more


---------44:02----------
about that feeling or what was in your


---------44:06----------
head


---------44:07----------
[Music]


---------44:13----------
what was in my head


---------44:20----------
that was a super vague question so let


---------44:22----------
me ask it this way it's kind of


---------44:23----------
difficult to answer yeah it was way too


---------44:25----------
vague


---------44:25----------
terrible question see i i could do


---------44:27----------
better


---------44:29----------
um can you tell me a little bit about


---------44:32----------
like what happened after you dropped out


---------44:33----------
after the eighth grade


---------44:36----------
um


---------44:40----------
i don't remember exactly but


---------44:45----------
in denmark you have to finish i guess


---------44:47----------
high school like 9th grade


---------44:49----------
so i would be gone for a bit but then


---------44:52----------
i don't know if i want to say the


---------44:54----------
authorities but people came to my house


---------44:56----------
and


---------44:56----------
talked to me and talked to my parents


---------44:57----------
like you have to go back to school it's


---------44:58----------
part of the law


---------45:00----------
someone kind of go back to school drop


---------45:01----------
back out back to school drop back out


---------45:06----------
here comes the the underdeveloped


---------45:09----------
maybe and


---------45:12----------
around this time i was


---------45:16----------
diagnosed with a non-verbal learning


---------45:18----------
disorder


---------45:19----------
and i started going to more like a


---------45:21----------
special needs school


---------45:23----------
with just less students and


---------45:27----------
a lot of them were kind of on the autism


---------45:28----------
or asperger's spectrum


---------45:31----------
and it was just kind of hard for me to


---------45:35----------
fit in i didn't really feel


---------45:36----------
fit in at the regular school and i


---------45:38----------
didn't really feel like i fit in at the


---------45:40----------
specialty school and now that i've gone


---------45:42----------
older i feel like


---------45:44----------
there's a good chance that it was kind


---------45:46----------
of an inaccurate diagnosis just based on


---------45:48----------
being in a really deep depression i


---------45:50----------
think that really changes you


---------45:52----------
but whether i am or have that or not


---------45:56----------
i don't really know but it was


---------46:00----------
was really tough on me at the time


---------46:03----------
how did you feel


---------46:07----------
what do you remember


---------46:23----------
how did i feel


---------46:26----------
i want to say the first thing that comes


---------46:28----------
to mind is i felt like my life was over


---------46:43----------
i'm not sure why i felt that way but


---------46:45----------
yeah totally


---------46:47----------
it's a good answer and um i remember


---------46:50----------
also feeling that way when


---------46:51----------
i first realized i had to wear glasses


---------46:54----------
because that was also


---------46:56----------
apparently a life ending thing when


---------46:59----------
you're a teenager


---------47:04----------
how would you feel if you missed two


---------47:06----------
hours of practice


---------47:13----------
[Music]


---------47:22----------
um


---------47:25----------
[Music]


---------47:32----------
weak maybe


---------47:39----------
help me understand that um


---------47:43----------
i guess in a sense that is kind of


---------47:49----------
saying that


---------47:52----------
i'm unable to kind of cope with the


---------47:54----------
stress of the job in my free time


---------47:55----------
so i have to take a little time off of


---------47:59----------
practice


---------48:03----------
have you felt weak before


---------48:07----------
[Music]


---------48:15----------
yeah i mean i think being human is being


---------48:17----------
weak in a lot of ways


---------48:19----------
and here years ago


---------48:23----------
i always as a player i really kind of


---------48:26----------
idealized


---------48:28----------
the korean chinese work ethic which is


---------48:30----------
like


---------48:31----------
sacrifice everything play all day


---------48:34----------
you don't need to exercise you don't


---------48:38----------
need relationships you don't need


---------48:39----------
balance you just need to grind


---------48:46----------
that was maybe four years ago


---------48:49----------
maybe even longer maybe like five six


---------48:51----------
years ago that was really


---------48:53----------
kind of what i strive to be and then as


---------48:55----------
i got older i realized i'm human


---------48:57----------
i should look out for sure that sounds


---------48:59----------
very


---------49:00----------
healthy i mean in terms of i


---------49:03----------
i guess kind of what i'm hearing soren


---------49:05----------
is like


---------49:08----------
when i think about so


---------49:11----------
what exactly happened with the


---------49:12----------
kindergarten thing what did they do


---------49:15----------
they like move through me over the fence


---------49:18----------
yeah and so i didn't quite unders


---------49:21----------
i couldn't quite paint a picture in my


---------49:23----------
mind but like when i think about


---------49:25----------
so i was bullied a lot growing up too


---------49:28----------
and if i had to describe one word i'd


---------49:30----------
never thought about bullying this way


---------49:33----------
but if i had to describe like one word


---------49:37----------
if i had to pick one word to describe


---------49:38----------
how i felt it was weak


---------49:43----------
um yeah


---------49:47----------
so like this is where you know i i feel


---------49:49----------
like i'm really leading more than


---------49:51----------
following in this interview which is


---------49:52----------
like arguably a mistake because


---------49:54----------
generally speaking like i should like


---------49:56----------
listen to what you have to say and then


---------49:58----------
like form a hypothesis but


---------49:59----------
i'm seeing like a pretty clear chain


---------50:01----------
here


---------50:02----------
and it may be hard i could be wrong


---------50:05----------
because i'm really not doing a good job


---------50:07----------
i'm not


---------50:07----------
following the rules of normally how i


---------50:10----------
approach this but


---------50:11----------
i i mean here's what i'm hearing from


---------50:13----------
you soren is that like you carry this


---------50:15----------
like fear of weakness


---------50:17----------
with you and that like you


---------50:20----------
won't relent at all for


---------50:23----------
fear of like being back in the pit like


---------50:25----------
you're not gonna go back there ever


---------50:28----------
ever no one's ever gonna throw you over


---------50:30----------
the fence you're never gonna be weak


---------50:32----------
they're never like


---------50:34----------
like it's never gonna happen


---------50:37----------
like you've been there before and you


---------50:39----------
and and this kind of comes back to the


---------50:40----------
question of i think


---------50:43----------
you've paid a price to be where you are


---------50:47----------
and that price is having that skull on


---------50:49----------
your on your piano


---------50:51----------
right it's like if i ask yeah


---------50:54----------
do you think that this is something i


---------50:58----------
can change or do you think this is just


---------50:59----------
how my


---------51:00----------
life has shaped me to be do you want to


---------51:03----------
change it


---------51:06----------
um


---------51:10----------
i don't know i mean i like


---------51:13----------
i like who i am i think you do


---------51:17----------
yeah i don't know so you said


---------51:20----------
is this something you can change or is


---------51:22----------
this something that your life has shaped


---------51:24----------
you to be i don't think that's an either


---------51:25----------
or question i think both are true


---------51:27----------
so i think you've been shaped this way


---------51:29----------
for better or for worse and can you


---------51:31----------
change it absolutely


---------51:33----------
but i think in order to change it you


---------51:34----------
have to do something that you really


---------51:36----------
don't want to do which is that you have


---------51:38----------
to take


---------51:39----------
you have to like schedule your ceo


---------51:41----------
meetings during the week


---------51:44----------
right and i think what we what's really


---------51:46----------
holding you back is i i don't i don't


---------51:48----------
really and this could be me being


---------51:49----------
ignorant right so i i really don't


---------51:51----------
know what your team functions like but


---------51:53----------
i've like i understand the inside of


---------51:57----------
i think a few professional law


---------51:58----------
organizations


---------52:00----------
and and i've seen this a lot like i'm


---------52:02----------
i've seen this everywhere


---------52:03----------
like i've seen this in investment


---------52:04----------
banking i've seen and i just don't


---------52:06----------
i just don't think physiologically that


---------52:08----------
like not taking a day off


---------52:10----------
in four months leads to the best


---------52:13----------
performance


---------52:17----------
would you this is kind of separate from


---------52:19----------
the whole conversation


---------52:21----------
more practical but for me i'm really


---------52:23----------
balancing like do i want to have some


---------52:25----------
more free time


---------52:26----------
in my day-to-day in my work days or do i


---------52:28----------
want to have more workload in the work


---------52:30----------
days and then have


---------52:31----------
have this day off that i can kind of


---------52:33----------
call mine i think that's


---------52:35----------
the wrong way to think about it


---------52:38----------
oh okay right so i i think i think it's


---------52:41----------
going to be challenging but


---------52:42----------
and i think the real thing is that your


---------52:44----------
real barrier i think is actually


---------52:46----------
emotional because i think that like you


---------52:48----------
don't


---------52:49----------
want to feel weak like you want to feel


---------52:51----------
like you're not letting people down like


---------52:53----------
the possibility


---------52:54----------
i think you i know it sounds weird you


---------52:56----------
know like


---------52:57----------
if you set a limit on how much you do


---------53:01----------
and like you let your team down as a


---------53:04----------
result


---------53:05----------
how would you feel about that


---------53:18----------
yeah but i would just feel awful


---------53:22----------
why um


---------53:40----------
hmm


---------53:45----------
just because


---------53:50----------
um yeah i don't know i think they


---------53:52----------
deserve better


---------53:54----------
i think what do you deserve


---------53:57----------
work work has always been a just a big


---------53:59----------
part of my life


---------54:01----------
sure so i would probably feel


---------54:05----------
it's always been my north star to kind


---------54:07----------
of do better at


---------54:09----------
i don't even really call it work but i


---------54:10----------
would do better as a player better as


---------54:13----------
kind of a part of this team uh


---------54:16----------
so if i was to not put in my full effort


---------54:19----------
i think i would


---------54:20----------
probably lose


---------54:23----------
kind of part of who i am or my identity


---------54:29----------
yeah so i think that's a challenge so a


---------54:32----------
sword i'm going to talk about something


---------54:33----------
and i i don't know if is this useful is


---------54:35----------
this conversation useful to you i mean


---------54:36----------
would you rather be crying right now


---------54:38----------
because we can make that happen no i


---------54:40----------
mean i had a few opportunities to cry


---------54:41----------
but i


---------54:43----------
laughed it off instead i i mean i feel


---------54:45----------
like this is this is really important


---------54:47----------
because i think like


---------54:48----------
so a lot of times when i work with


---------54:50----------
people who are very successful


---------54:52----------
like we talk about letting go of


---------54:54----------
ambition


---------54:56----------
and and they sort of say like it's


---------54:58----------
ambition that's gotten me this far


---------55:00----------
like i don't understand like if i let go


---------55:03----------
so like a good example is like


---------55:04----------
like i work with a lot of people in


---------55:06----------
investment banking


---------55:08----------
and so those people like these people


---------55:09----------
like work really really hard like they


---------55:11----------
were


---------55:12----------
crazy hours you know it's like like big


---------55:14----------
big deals like 100 million dollar deals


---------55:17----------
billion dollar deals


---------55:19----------
and and they're they sort of like it's


---------55:21----------
always like there's always more to do


---------55:23----------
there's always a promotion there's


---------55:24----------
always another deal


---------55:26----------
and it's ambition that's gotten them


---------55:27----------
this far


---------55:29----------
and so they get really really concerned


---------55:30----------
that if i let go of my ambition like


---------55:32----------
i'll be nothing like this is who i am


---------55:35----------
right like you're someone who likes


---------55:37----------
soren i think you're never


---------55:39----------
gonna be weak again like to hell with


---------55:42----------
that


---------55:42----------
like you would never put yourself in


---------55:44----------
that situation


---------55:46----------
i think that the challenge here is that


---------55:48----------
you know if you look at the physiology


---------55:50----------
of performance


---------55:51----------
and there's been a lot of work on on


---------55:52----------
this kind of stuff like having high


---------55:54----------
levels of cortisol


---------55:55----------
a stress hormone which i imagine is


---------55:57----------
going to be higher in your system when


---------55:59----------
you're


---------55:59----------
working for four months without a break


---------56:02----------
is going to lead to


---------56:03----------
less creative decision making so when


---------56:06----------
cortisol is floating around in your


---------56:08----------
system and adrenaline is floating around


---------56:10----------
in your system these are stress hormones


---------56:12----------
that we release more of


---------56:13----------
when we work way too much it actually


---------56:16----------
reduces your capacity for creative


---------56:18----------
thinking


---------56:19----------
because when the way that our brains


---------56:21----------
evolved like


---------56:23----------
when our fight or flight system is


---------56:25----------
involved like we don't want creative


---------56:26----------
thinking like when i run into a tiger in


---------56:28----------
the woods


---------56:30----------
i don't want to think creatively like my


---------56:32----------
body needs to act


---------56:34----------
so like nuance gets lost and everything


---------56:36----------
becomes black and white


---------56:39----------
and i don't think and it's interesting


---------56:41----------
because we started off talking about


---------56:42----------
sort of this feeling of autopilot and


---------56:44----------
awareness


---------56:46----------
that decays throughout the season and


---------56:48----------
you say to me like oh yeah we have it at


---------56:50----------
the beginning i can think creatively but


---------56:51----------
then we fall into the grind


---------56:53----------
i think it's absolutely physiologically


---------56:55----------
or neuroscientifically


---------56:57----------
because literally as the season advances


---------57:00----------
your


---------57:01----------
your brain is going to change


---------57:06----------
and and so i know this sounds absolutely


---------57:08----------
insane but like when i talk to these


---------57:09----------
people and i'm like yeah you don't need


---------57:11----------
to be striving for a promotion


---------57:13----------
to be doing your best work and they're


---------57:14----------
really confused because they think that


---------57:16----------
like


---------57:16----------
if i'm not striving for a promotion i


---------57:18----------
don't know how to work


---------57:19----------
and the beautiful thing is that they i


---------57:22----------
mean oftentimes they wind up in my


---------57:23----------
office because


---------57:24----------
you know things need to change


---------57:27----------
and then and then we kind of get to the


---------57:28----------
point where i teach them how to let go


---------57:30----------
of their ambition and they do


---------57:31----------
wonderfully


---------57:33----------
because i i think it sounds kind of


---------57:34----------
weird but they're like other reasons for


---------57:36----------
you to work than ambition


---------57:38----------
and there are things that you can do


---------57:40----------
like your loyalty to your team not


---------57:41----------
wanting to let them down


---------57:43----------
needs to be separated from your personal


---------57:45----------
feelings of weakness


---------57:49----------
does that make sense


---------57:53----------
yeah i can't say i know how to do that


---------57:54----------
but yep so


---------57:56----------
and and that's why we're not going to


---------57:57----------
crying rap because i'd like to teach you


---------57:59----------
today and for everyone else


---------58:01----------
who like beats themselves up to try to


---------58:03----------
be something


---------58:05----------
because there's a huge difference


---------58:06----------
between not letting your team down


---------58:08----------
and you feeling personally weak and i


---------58:11----------
know it sounds kind of bizarre but it's


---------58:12----------
my


---------58:13----------
there's a hypothesis i don't know if


---------58:15----------
this is right or wrong that you


---------58:17----------
letting go of your feelings of weakness


---------58:18----------
will actually be like


---------58:20----------
will allow you to be the best coach for


---------58:22----------
your team


---------58:26----------
yeah i agree i definitely feel like i


---------58:29----------
don't know this is related but


---------58:30----------
sometimes i definitely do feel like uh


---------58:36----------
i'm too focused and worried about myself


---------58:38----------
when i should really be putting all my


---------58:39----------
focus on


---------58:41----------
on the players yeah that's really tricky


---------58:44----------
because you're gonna just


---------58:45----------
put i mean you're gonna find any reason


---------58:48----------
to beat yourself up so like i take that


---------58:51----------
with a grain of salt


---------58:52----------
right like like i i think the number of


---------58:54----------
ways in which you have thought through


---------58:56----------
that you can be better


---------58:58----------
is tricky because i think that's the


---------59:00----------
problem on the one hand you're


---------59:02----------
absolutely correct but on the other hand


---------59:04----------
like why aren't you good enough


---------59:10----------
was that an actual question yeah


---------59:15----------
why am i not good enough yeah


---------59:20----------
i don't really think i have an answer to


---------59:22----------
that do you feel not good enough


---------59:36----------
uh i mean it just goes kind of back to


---------59:39----------
where we


---------59:40----------
back to the beginning right i feel like


---------59:41----------
i can be better


---------59:43----------
i feel like i'm learning do you need to


---------59:45----------
be better


---------59:47----------
yeah why


---------59:51----------
to serve my team and my players better


---------59:59----------
can i think about that for a second sure


---------60:07----------
let me put it this way and i don't know


---------60:10----------
how much progress we're going to make


---------60:11----------
here


---------60:12----------
are you enough for your team


---------60:19----------
um


---------60:23----------
the way that i am yes um


---------60:28----------
no i don't think so


---------60:31----------
how would you know if you were


---------60:36----------
[Music]


---------60:41----------
i don't think i would know which is why


---------60:42----------
i say i don't think so i don't i don't


---------60:44----------
know for a fact


---------60:45----------
right so what if i told you i'm just i'm


---------60:47----------
gonna i'm gonna say something


---------60:50----------
and i want to know what your instinctive


---------60:51----------
reaction is to these words


---------60:54----------
you're enough for your team you're


---------60:56----------
exactly what your team needs


---------60:58----------
in the way that you are in this moment


---------61:00----------
you don't need to be


---------61:01----------
any better than what you are


---------61:11----------
it's hard hard for me to believe that


---------61:15----------
that's a very


---------61:18----------
sugar-coated response what what did you


---------61:22----------
think


---------61:23----------
what were you thinking is that what did


---------61:24----------
you think and feel as i said those words


---------61:33----------
what did i think and feel


---------61:36----------
uh that


---------61:40----------
that it was very nice of you but that


---------61:42----------
that you don't really know


---------61:44----------
there cuz you don't know how i work you


---------61:46----------
don't see my work


---------61:47----------
yep and if i did see what would i notice


---------61:54----------
what is it that i don't know about you


---------61:56----------
soren that you do


---------62:01----------
uh i mean i don't even know yet


---------62:04----------
of course there are a lot of things that


---------62:10----------
i know i can do better and then there's


---------62:12----------
the things that i'm kind of yet to


---------62:14----------
discover yeah so this is tricky but i'm


---------62:17----------
going to


---------62:17----------
try to say this one more time like if i


---------62:20----------
knew you


---------62:20----------
the way that you know yourself soren


---------62:23----------
what would i


---------62:24----------
what's the difference right because i i


---------62:26----------
can tell that like when i said that what


---------62:27----------
i saw in your eyes was


---------62:29----------
this guy has no [ __ ] idea what he's


---------62:30----------
talking about


---------62:33----------
right so tell me what i don't know


---------62:39----------
what do you not know what are you


---------62:44----------
um i don't really know how to answer


---------62:45----------
that question


---------62:50----------
not knowing how to answer that question


---------62:52----------
is different from


---------62:54----------
like there's something i'm missing right


---------62:58----------
because for me to say that it's like


---------63:00----------
ignorance


---------63:04----------
does that make sense like yeah


---------63:07----------
yeah i mean so educate me


---------63:12----------
educate you what am i ignorant of


---------63:16----------
what part of you don't i understand what


---------63:19----------
am i missing


---------63:25----------
well i'm thinking more in relation to to


---------63:27----------
my work right


---------63:29----------
sure


---------63:32----------
um


---------63:40----------
yeah i guess just i feel like i can


---------63:44----------
i feel like i can always do more and i


---------63:46----------
can always work harder


---------63:49----------
which is maybe not what you want to hear


---------63:51----------
but


---------63:52----------
yeah so i think that what we're getting


---------63:54----------
into is a is a conflict because i think


---------63:56----------
you're


---------63:56----------
like i think you have to unsugar coat it


---------63:58----------
to be able to say it


---------64:00----------
so so let me let me let me this i'm not


---------64:03----------
trying to hide anything i'm just


---------64:05----------
i i i don't think you are i think it's


---------64:07----------
just gonna be tough


---------64:08----------
right so maybe i'm barking up the wrong


---------64:09----------
tree but like


---------64:11----------
i can tell so the reason that i said


---------64:13----------
that is because i know you're gonna have


---------64:15----------
like


---------64:15----------
when i said like i think you are enough


---------64:19----------
right like i think you're fine by your


---------64:20----------
players by the way have you ever talked


---------64:21----------
to your players about whether


---------64:23----------
they feel like you're letting them down


---------64:27----------
[Music]


---------64:30----------
no what do you think about having a


---------64:33----------
conversation like that


---------64:35----------
[Laughter]


---------64:39----------
um


---------65:04----------
yeah i don't really know i feel like


---------65:06----------
most of them would just be


---------65:10----------
be really nice about it what does that


---------65:13----------
mean be


---------65:13----------
really nice about it


---------65:18----------
oh sorry i'm just i need to answer a


---------65:19----------
message from my manager


---------65:34----------
okay um


---------65:40----------
i think if i was to ask a question like


---------65:41----------
am i letting you down i think that


---------65:43----------
obviously if someone was to ask me that


---------65:46----------
it would kind of seem like they need


---------65:47----------
reassurance


---------65:48----------
so i would probably give them


---------65:48----------
reassurance maybe i would


---------65:52----------
yeah i guess that's just how i feel


---------65:57----------
okay so


---------66:00----------
how would they signal to you if they


---------66:02----------
really thought you were not letting


---------66:04----------
them down what could they say to you


---------66:07----------
that would convince you that they think


---------66:08----------
you're doing a fantastic job and they're


---------66:10----------
happy to have you


---------66:22----------
[Music]


---------66:29----------
do you mind repeating that yeah so like


---------66:31----------
how would they signal to you so like


---------66:33----------
let's say so


---------66:33----------
here's what what okay let's just take a


---------66:35----------
step back start from the top


---------66:37----------
okay so it's my belief that you have


---------66:40----------
a sense of inadequacy that


---------66:46----------
keeps you striving to be the best but is


---------66:48----------
personally like tortures you


---------66:52----------
like i think it's got to be like a hard


---------66:54----------
way to live your life where you wake up


---------66:56----------
like somewhat content


---------66:58----------
you're like ah let me sleep in and then


---------67:00----------
you see that skull


---------67:02----------
and the skull is like [ __ ] you get out


---------67:04----------
of bed


---------67:06----------
weakling right


---------67:09----------
you're like on the days that i'm really


---------67:11----------
tired i look at the skull


---------67:13----------
and it reminds me that i need to be


---------67:14----------
better in that i'm not good enough


---------67:18----------
and so okay fine so then i turn to you


---------67:21----------
and i say something


---------67:22----------
absolutely idiotic which is soren i


---------67:24----------
think you're fantastic just the way that


---------67:26----------
you are


---------67:27----------
and you're like this [ __ ] guy that's


---------67:29----------
his job he sees the best in everyone


---------67:32----------
right it's his job to like accept people


---------67:35----------
but he doesn't


---------67:36----------
understand


---------67:40----------
right totally understand like that's


---------67:42----------
fair it's completely fair i don't


---------67:44----------
i don't know you bro i'm missing


---------67:47----------
something


---------67:47----------
it's my job to see the best in everyone


---------67:50----------
and there's like something in you that


---------67:51----------
is clearly not the best


---------67:52----------
fine i accept that too because i don't


---------67:55----------
know you you're right


---------67:56----------
then i ask you so fill me in tell me


---------67:59----------
help me understand what it is about you


---------68:00----------
that i don't know


---------68:01----------
you have a lot of trouble answering that


---------68:04----------
because there's like


---------68:05----------
if we think about it like you can't


---------68:07----------
protest


---------68:08----------
against my statement unless there's


---------68:11----------
something like because


---------68:12----------
your your your protest is like quite


---------68:14----------
strong


---------68:15----------
and so i think that like it's like pit


---------68:17----------
soaring down there that's like you


---------68:18----------
didn't see me when i got tossed over the


---------68:20----------
fence into the kindergarten


---------68:22----------
then you had to like walk through the


---------68:24----------
[ __ ] kindergarten back to your school


---------68:26----------
like


---------68:29----------
you know like that's pathetic man


---------68:33----------
and yeah right so i think that that like


---------68:37----------
leaves a scar and i think this is the


---------68:40----------
scar that we're running up against


---------68:42----------
and now we get into a real problem


---------68:44----------
because


---------68:45----------
your adaptation to that scar is


---------68:48----------
responsible for your success


---------68:52----------
it's the work ethic it's the the


---------68:54----------
constant feeling that you could be


---------68:56----------
better


---------68:58----------
and like like that's what's gotten you


---------69:01----------
to where you are


---------69:03----------
and so fair i don't know your team i


---------69:06----------
don't know league of legends


---------69:07----------
i'm a noob fine i don't know you fine


---------69:10----------
right because the response that i heard


---------69:12----------
when i said i think you're good enough


---------69:14----------
is you don't know me


---------69:17----------
like you don't you don't really know you


---------69:20----------
don't know what you're talking about


---------69:21----------
fine so there's something there about


---------69:23----------
you that is not good enough fine


---------69:25----------
so then let's let's turn to someone who


---------69:27----------
does know right like because your


---------69:28----------
teammates know


---------69:31----------
like they're your teammates like they


---------69:32----------
know whether you're doing a good job


---------69:33----------
they know whether you're doing enough


---------69:37----------
and and then we get to the real crux of


---------69:39----------
the problem is that like if you go to


---------69:41----------
them and you say like


---------69:42----------
am i doing enough like what are they


---------69:44----------
gonna see they're gonna see someone


---------69:46----------
who's weak


---------69:48----------
who needs reassurance and they're gonna


---------69:50----------
say


---------69:53----------
yeah no so uh soren you're doing great


---------69:55----------
man


---------69:56----------
oh man you're so handsome


---------70:00----------
you're so smart right like that's


---------70:03----------
like you feel like you're gonna be like


---------70:07----------
like now i'm almost getting like like


---------70:09----------
they're gonna put you in the special


---------70:10----------
school all over again like they can't


---------70:12----------
they can't give it to you straight


---------70:16----------
and so the two things that i'd point out


---------70:19----------
to you is first like how would you know


---------70:22----------
right if they actually did think that


---------70:23----------
you did an awesome job


---------70:26----------
and that like like because i i'm i can


---------70:29----------
almost i can


---------70:30----------
i'm pretty sure if i had the opportunity


---------70:32----------
to talk to them this is what they'd say


---------70:34----------
that your work ethic is amazing that


---------70:36----------
you're an inspiration


---------70:38----------
and that like they're really optimistic


---------70:40----------
because like you're on their team


---------70:42----------
and that they think you're doing a


---------70:43----------
fantastic job


---------70:49----------
like i would i would give you ten to one


---------70:51----------
odds that that's what they would say


---------70:54----------
and now the problem is like now i'm


---------70:56----------
gonna point out to you like where the


---------70:58----------
problem is is like how are you gonna


---------70:59----------
know like how are you gonna know if


---------71:01----------
you're enough


---------71:03----------
even if they tell you if i tell you like


---------71:05----------
no as many people as you want to


---------71:08----------
can tell you but as long as that voice


---------71:11----------
is there


---------71:12----------
discounting and undermining everything


---------71:15----------
all of the signals


---------71:16----------
that get sent your way this is not going


---------71:18----------
to change


---------71:26----------
and what i'm talking about is like a


---------71:28----------
radical change


---------71:29----------
this is reshaping who you are


---------71:33----------
it's like accepting that you actually


---------71:35----------
are enough today and you can do more


---------71:37----------
tomorrow don't worry


---------71:38----------
you don't have to let go of being better


---------71:39----------
tomorrow


---------71:41----------
but what i want to let i want you to


---------71:43----------
what i want you to do is let go of like


---------71:45----------
feeling fundamentally not good enough


---------71:47----------
because i suspect that like in other


---------71:48----------
parts of your life too


---------71:51----------
you know and i don't know how much to


---------71:52----------
read into his ex-girlfriend but


---------71:56----------
you know in other parts of your life too


---------71:58----------
like i'm afraid that there may be


---------72:00----------
situations where you are


---------72:01----------
actually fully adequate but you don't


---------72:04----------
feel that way


---------72:06----------
that that is actually on point yeah


---------72:10----------
in my relationship i often felt like i


---------72:11----------
was not


---------72:13----------
or i felt like she was dissatisfied with


---------72:15----------
me a lot even though


---------72:17----------
then she would tell me i am satisfied


---------72:20----------
with you


---------72:20----------
but maybe like there's this thing or


---------72:22----------
this thing but those things would


---------72:26----------
hit me very hard so so this is what i


---------72:28----------
see in in people


---------72:30----------
who like have what you have


---------72:33----------
is that they become self-fulfilling


---------72:35----------
prophecies


---------72:38----------
so like when someone feels inadequate in


---------72:40----------
a relationship


---------72:41----------
their partner will tell them no i


---------72:43----------
actually really like being


---------72:45----------
with you but their mind will latch on to


---------72:48----------
the 10


---------72:49----------
of what their partner says instead of


---------72:50----------
the 90 i really do want to be with you


---------72:53----------
and of course you're not perfect and


---------72:55----------
then your mind is like there it is


---------72:56----------
let's let's shove aside the 90 of


---------72:59----------
contentment and


---------72:59----------
and zero in on the 10 and that actually


---------73:02----------
becomes a self-fulfilling prophecy


---------73:05----------
we see this as well in people who have a


---------73:07----------
fear of abandonment where like they


---------73:08----------
think like they're


---------73:09----------
they tell their partner or the they're


---------73:11----------
afraid that their partner is going to


---------73:12----------
leave them


---------73:13----------
partners like no i'm not going to leave


---------73:14----------
you like i like being in this relation


---------73:16----------
they're like you're going to leave


---------73:17----------
like no i'm not and then like they tell


---------73:19----------
them like you're gonna leave i know


---------73:20----------
you're gonna leave


---------73:21----------
you didn't text me back who are you with


---------73:23----------
you're gonna leave me


---------73:24----------
you're gonna leave me you're gonna leave


---------73:25----------
me i have i i have also had that in a


---------73:27----------
relationship and i did at the


---------73:29----------
record right and it's like it becomes a


---------73:32----------
self-fulfilling prophecy


---------73:34----------
so i think like soren you're playing a


---------73:36----------
rigged game man


---------73:38----------
and it all cut like it doesn't matter


---------73:39----------
like who you hear it from


---------73:41----------
how qualified there are like even if you


---------73:43----------
heard it from the ceo you're like he


---------73:45----------
doesn't


---------73:46----------
know right like like if if your ceo is


---------73:48----------
like


---------73:49----------
hey i saw and i think you're doing a


---------73:50----------
fantastic job like


---------73:52----------
you'd be like he doesn't see what i do


---------73:54----------
day to day


---------73:56----------
that voice is always do you see the


---------73:58----------
voice that i'm talking about that's


---------74:00----------
just like always there


---------74:04----------
yeah so do you


---------74:08----------
want that to change is that voice a bad


---------74:12----------
thing


---------74:15----------
[Music]


---------74:24----------
i guess my worry is if i don't have that


---------74:27----------
voice


---------74:29----------
i always had the feeling that if i ever


---------74:32----------
lost my drive i just shouldn't be in


---------74:36----------
this


---------74:37----------
line of work because this line of work


---------74:40----------
is like


---------74:41----------
striving to be the very very best and


---------74:44----------
you have to make sacrifices to do that


---------74:47----------
so i guess part of my worry is if i was


---------74:50----------
to lose that


---------74:52----------
i don't think i would find as much joy


---------74:56----------
out of this work and then i would have


---------74:57----------
to find something else to do and i


---------74:59----------
don't know what that would be so i


---------75:02----------
disagree with that completely


---------75:04----------
so i understand where you're coming from


---------75:06----------
it just hasn't been my experience


---------75:07----------
at all so can i can i try to convince


---------75:10----------
you for a moment


---------75:12----------
sure so


---------75:16----------
i get what you're saying that like this


---------75:17----------
voice is what drives you forward


---------75:20----------
right and this is why i asked you at the


---------75:21----------
very beginning and you asked me to you


---------75:22----------
were like is this a bad thing


---------75:24----------
then i asked you do you want to get rid


---------75:26----------
of it and i don't think you do


---------75:28----------
and that's the problem so like when i


---------75:30----------
ask you like do you want to be fulfilled


---------75:32----------
i don't think you do


---------75:34----------
like i think that any time you you have


---------75:36----------
like


---------75:37----------
like i don't see you like ever relaxing


---------75:41----------
like even when you win right i am i'm


---------75:44----------
really afraid of


---------75:47----------
complacency because i've seen


---------75:49----------
[Music]


---------75:51----------
i've seen i've been playing i have what


---------75:54----------
i had


---------75:55----------
and i could have continued to play if i


---------75:57----------
wanted to i won the


---------75:59----------
the north american season before i i


---------76:01----------
chose to go into coaching


---------76:04----------
and i played professionally for i think


---------76:07----------
eight years and i saw


---------76:09----------
just so many players find success and


---------76:11----------
then


---------76:12----------
become comfortable and then eventually


---------76:16----------
uh stop playing because


---------76:19----------
they kind of lost their drive


---------76:22----------
and i understand that so i i think


---------76:25----------
though


---------76:26----------
soren you're not them i'm not worried


---------76:29----------
about you losing your drive


---------76:31----------
and i actually think that like the best


---------76:33----------
that the best performance you're gonna


---------76:35----------
see


---------76:36----------
by all means grind by all means work a


---------76:38----------
lot like i'm not telling you to like not


---------76:40----------
work


---------76:42----------
but i think that the best like


---------76:45----------
literally like neuroscientifically and


---------76:48----------
like


---------76:48----------
optimizing performance wise when you're


---------76:52----------
operating from a place of like positive


---------76:54----------
energy and positive emotion you're


---------76:56----------
actually going to outperform


---------76:57----------
what you're capable of with like


---------76:59----------
negative energy and negative emotion


---------77:02----------
i do want to say i feel like before


---------77:04----------
kobet i was


---------77:07----------
closer to that uh living a kind of more


---------77:10----------
balanced lifestyle


---------77:12----------
i think covetous definitely maybe


---------77:14----------
brought out the worst in that because


---------77:16----------
we were also in a really strict bubble


---------77:18----------
system in order to stay safe right so i


---------77:19----------
was only at my apartment


---------77:21----------
and at the office i didn't see any


---------77:23----------
friends for six months


---------77:24----------
well even longer obviously like for it


---------77:28----------
so it's just kind of all my time has


---------77:30----------
really gone into


---------77:32----------
working which probably um


---------77:36----------
strengthens these feelings so


---------77:40----------
that makes me think even more so that


---------77:43----------
like


---------77:45----------
letting go of some of these feelings is


---------77:47----------
going to be a step forward for you


---------77:49----------
because if if in a high stress


---------77:51----------
environment these feelings are getting


---------77:53----------
worse like generally speaking like


---------77:54----------
depression and anxiety and all that


---------77:55----------
stuff is getting worse during coconut


---------77:58----------
so it's not like your optimal function


---------78:00----------
it's like


---------78:02----------
it's almost like a coping mechanism it's


---------78:04----------
like it's like your internal cheat code


---------78:06----------
to keep working


---------78:12----------
and something tells me that like


---------78:16----------
you know i'm not seriously i'm not


---------78:17----------
saying slack off but i don't think


---------78:19----------
you're gonna slack off i don't think we


---------78:20----------
have to worry about you slacking off


---------78:21----------
like i don't think that


---------78:22----------
if this changed in you emotionally i


---------78:24----------
think there's too much


---------78:26----------
programming in your brain your neurons


---------78:28----------
have wired a certain way to where you're


---------78:30----------
not going to just like wake up and do


---------78:31----------
nothing


---------78:33----------
like it's just not who you are


---------78:36----------
and what's going to change then or what


---------78:38----------
what could change them


---------78:40----------
it's a good question um


---------78:45----------
so i think that like like i was saying


---------78:47----------
there are a couple of feelings that are


---------78:49----------
tangled up here


---------78:50----------
one is like striving to be the best one


---------78:53----------
is not wanting to let your team down


---------78:55----------
and the third is like feeling weak or


---------78:57----------
inadequate


---------79:00----------
what i'm saying is that i don't think


---------79:02----------
that all three of those have to like go


---------79:03----------
together


---------79:05----------
right like you can care about your


---------79:06----------
teammates you can want to not let them


---------79:08----------
down


---------79:09----------
but also recognize that like you are


---------79:12----------
good enough


---------79:14----------
that together as a team you guys can


---------79:16----------
actually do this


---------79:19----------
that you don't have to worry like you


---------79:20----------
shouldn't be worrying about


---------79:23----------
like whether you're good enough or not


---------79:25----------
like you've got no head space for that


---------79:28----------
you should be focused like fully on your


---------79:30----------
team like you said you kind of think a


---------79:31----------
little bit about yourself too much


---------79:33----------
because i know it sounds weird but i


---------79:35----------
mean if we're talking about


---------79:35----------
self-fulfilling prophecies in


---------79:37----------
relationships


---------79:38----------
that could happen in the professional


---------79:40----------
space too


---------79:42----------
and the real problem here at the end of


---------79:44----------
the day sort i think the real problem is


---------79:46----------
that you don't


---------79:47----------
like you can't ever know what's right


---------79:49----------
and what isn't


---------79:50----------
right like you can't ever know like


---------79:51----------
what's gonna be enough if i tell you


---------79:53----------
you're not gonna listen if your


---------79:53----------
teammates tell you that you're not gonna


---------79:55----------
listen


---------79:57----------
so like if there was some objective


---------79:58----------
measure of your enoughness then i'd say


---------80:01----------
this is a whole different ballgame


---------80:03----------
but in the absence of that like your


---------80:05----------
mind is always going to tell you that


---------80:07----------
you're not enough


---------80:08----------
it's not enough that you need to be


---------80:09----------
better and you can love your teammates


---------80:12----------
you can want to like lead them to


---------80:13----------
victory


---------80:15----------
but like being fundamentally faithless


---------80:18----------
in yourself which i'm using


---------80:20----------
like exaggerated language here is like


---------80:23----------
not gonna be


---------80:26----------
and now we're falling into another chat


---------80:27----------
because now i'm telling you that you you


---------80:28----------
that you need to be better


---------80:30----------
but you know like fundamentally


---------80:33----------
believing that you are good enough


---------80:35----------
fundamentally believing that you are


---------80:37----------
what your team


---------80:38----------
needs can lead to hubris or pride or


---------80:41----------
complacency


---------80:43----------
but i think in your case at the highest


---------80:45----------
levels of performance sorin


---------80:46----------
i think it starts to become maladaptive


---------80:49----------
that for 99


---------80:51----------
of the road the work ethic that you've


---------80:53----------
got in the emotions that you've got


---------80:55----------
and feeling not good enough is going to


---------80:57----------
get you 99


---------80:59----------
of the way there but if you want to walk


---------81:01----------
that last step you have to let go of


---------81:03----------
this


---------81:09----------
what do you think


---------81:15----------
[Music]


---------81:26----------
um


---------81:30----------
uh i agree and


---------81:34----------
i have come up


---------81:37----------
maybe against these kinds of things with


---------81:39----------
with a therapist


---------81:40----------
and they're just so


---------81:44----------
deeply rooted that i i don't know where


---------81:45----------
to begin


---------81:47----------
you know okay so


---------81:50----------
we can i'm glad you see a therapist by


---------81:52----------
the way that's good um


---------81:53----------
so let me now now let's let's do this


---------81:56----------
together


---------81:57----------
okay so if you're with me like where i i


---------81:59----------
don't have an answer for you so we're


---------82:01----------
gonna have to figure this out together


---------82:02----------
okay what do you think about that


---------82:05----------
sure i hear one of the tales but


---------82:11----------
okay so so let's think about the


---------82:14----------
conundrum so here i am telling you that


---------82:16----------
you need to accept yourself


---------82:17----------
more and that you are good enough right


---------82:22----------
and really feeding into my thing that


---------82:23----------
you're telling me that


---------82:25----------
if i change something i can be even


---------82:27----------
better yeah exactly exactly that


---------82:29----------
so that's the problem so what what what


---------82:31----------
do we


---------82:32----------
what do we do about that because even if


---------82:34----------
i try to tell you to move in the right


---------82:36----------
direction i'm actually falling into your


---------82:38----------
trap you're the one who's trapped me


---------82:42----------
yeah i mean i honestly have no idea


---------82:44----------
where to begin


---------82:48----------
well sorry i was i was coming up at a


---------82:50----------
point where


---------82:53----------
i was learning more so to kind of accept


---------82:55----------
and understand myself rather than trying


---------82:56----------
to change


---------82:58----------
yeah so so then then then i think that


---------83:01----------
sounds right


---------83:04----------
um so but then then i guess then what we


---------83:07----------
i have a practical answer for you but i


---------83:08----------
just want to appreciate the conundrum


---------83:10----------
that we're in here which is that


---------83:12----------
either you accept yourself where you are


---------83:14----------
and then you don't strive to be better


---------83:15----------
which is sort of i guess winning


---------83:17----------
or i'm telling you hey like you need to


---------83:19----------
learn how to accept yourself which is


---------83:20----------
like


---------83:20----------
you don't does that make it it's like it


---------83:22----------
doesn't it was stuck


---------83:24----------
right so if we truly accept you then


---------83:26----------
what we should say is


---------83:28----------
soren you should continue not accepting


---------83:30----------
yourself


---------83:32----------
that is acceptance


---------83:37----------
yeah right and then if if we say like


---------83:40----------
sorry you need to learn how to accept


---------83:42----------
yourself that was very convenient for me


---------83:44----------
right so or i can say soren you need to


---------83:47----------
you need to learn how to accept yourself


---------83:49----------
which isn't of itself


---------83:50----------
not accepting yourself


---------83:53----------
so we're stuck so the good news is that


---------83:56----------
there's actually like a really simple


---------83:58----------
way to move forward and i think


---------83:59----------
you're well along this path the first is


---------84:01----------
just to notice


---------84:02----------
the absurdity of what we're talking


---------84:04----------
about it's dumb


---------84:06----------
the whole thing is unsolvable


---------84:10----------
okay and i know it sounds kind of weird


---------84:12----------
but every time you notice that feeling


---------84:15----------
in you


---------84:16----------
that you need to be better and then if


---------84:19----------
you move towards saying like oh i


---------84:20----------
shouldn't feel this way


---------84:22----------
that's wrong and if you blindly follow


---------84:26----------
it that's wrong too


---------84:28----------
so like what we really need is simply


---------84:30----------
just awareness


---------84:31----------
to recognize that like either path we go


---------84:34----------
down is wrong


---------84:37----------
and so if we don't go down a path like


---------84:40----------
what do we do


---------84:46----------
like if i'm not moving like so you're


---------84:48----------
saying if i walk down this path it's


---------84:50----------
wrong if i walk down this path it's


---------84:51----------
wrong


---------84:51----------
so what are my options then


---------85:07----------
i don't know it's it's weird so


---------85:10----------
do nothing with awareness


---------85:14----------
right just notice i know it's weird but


---------85:17----------
just like


---------85:18----------
notice the conundrum within you and on a


---------85:20----------
much more


---------85:21----------
practical level there are going to be


---------85:24----------
times in your life


---------85:25----------
where you're gonna feel like taking


---------85:28----------
you know an hour off to


---------85:31----------
do like meet with the ceo you're gonna


---------85:34----------
feel weak


---------85:35----------
like you should be able to handle it


---------85:37----------
does that make sense


---------85:42----------
yeah like throughout your week very


---------85:44----------
practically there are going to be times


---------85:46----------
where you feel weak


---------85:47----------
where you feel inadequate where you're


---------85:49----------
afraid of holding everyone back


---------85:51----------
and so a lot of your actions and your


---------85:54----------
schedule


---------85:55----------
has been structured based on those


---------85:58----------
negative emotions


---------86:00----------
of fear and inadequacy and things like


---------86:02----------
that does that make sense


---------86:07----------
so this is going to be tough for you


---------86:09----------
soren it's going to be very hard


---------86:11----------
but don't give in to those negative


---------86:13----------
emotions


---------86:17----------
right and what i mean by that is notice


---------86:19----------
that like like if you schedule a meeting


---------86:22----------
with your manager


---------86:23----------
during practice you're gonna feel like


---------86:25----------
you're letting your team down


---------86:28----------
and this is where like honestly what i


---------86:30----------
would recommend i'm gonna give you like


---------86:31----------
a very simple straight


---------86:32----------
straight playbook so you go to your team


---------86:34----------
and and you should have a conversation


---------86:36----------
with them about hey we meet for practice


---------86:37----------
eight hours a day


---------86:40----------
i have some other obligations as coach


---------86:42----------
i've got to meet with this person and


---------86:44----------
this person


---------86:44----------
how would you all feel about me taking


---------86:46----------
some of those meetings in the middle of


---------86:48----------
practice and then like the assistant


---------86:49----------
coach


---------86:52----------
like how would you guys feel if i missed


---------86:53----------
like an hour or two of practice a day


---------87:01----------
okay that sounds extremely uncomfortable


---------87:04----------
yup


---------87:05----------
there it is what are you feeling right


---------87:16----------
now


---------87:19----------
week because if i was the player i would


---------87:23----------
say


---------87:24----------
don't you have x amount of hours before


---------87:26----------
and after practice to do those things


---------87:28----------
why do you need to do it in the middle


---------87:30----------
of practice


---------87:32----------
okay sure so if that's what they say


---------87:35----------
then you're going to listen to them


---------87:39----------
well that's what i would tell myself but


---------87:41----------
yeah


---------87:42----------
right so so so and and this is what like


---------87:45----------
like i think you've got


---------87:46----------
to like like listen to your team


---------87:49----------
right and say like do i need to be here


---------87:51----------
i mean i'm assuming you guys you don't


---------87:53----------
how many hours a week do you all i don't


---------87:54----------
want to like ask you too many details


---------87:55----------
about what your practice schedule is and


---------87:57----------
stuff like that


---------87:57----------
because that could be like competitive


---------87:59----------
information but i'm assuming that


---------88:02----------
you know you guys are basically


---------88:03----------
practicing like six days a week


---------88:07----------
um


---------88:07----------
[Music]


---------88:10----------
the schedule is it's kind of different


---------88:13----------
now so we have actually


---------88:14----------
three match days and then one off day


---------88:17----------
and then we have uh


---------88:18----------
three practice days okay


---------88:21----------
during season so so if it's if it's


---------88:23----------
during season maybe you need to crunch


---------88:25----------
things too so i'm willing to concede


---------88:27----------
that like if you guys


---------88:28----------
have three match days and three practice


---------88:29----------
days maybe you don't want to miss any of


---------88:30----------
that


---------88:31----------
but i think it's worthwhile like having


---------88:33----------
a conversation with your team


---------88:34----------
and like this is the whole point is that


---------88:36----------
you can't let your feelings of weakness


---------88:38----------
determine what's right or wrong


---------88:46----------
and if if it's season maybe you don't


---------88:48----------
have time to


---------88:49----------
because that sounds super tight to me


---------88:51----------
like i don't i'm not hearing there's


---------88:52----------
actually a whole lot of time


---------88:54----------
so it's really difficult yeah but we


---------88:56----------
don't have as much


---------88:57----------
near as much practice as we used to be


---------88:59----------
able to do so so then the question is


---------89:01----------
like do you need to be meeting with your


---------89:02----------
ceo like


---------89:03----------
during this time


---------89:09----------
uh


---------89:21----------
uh i'm not sure okay so so so i i


---------89:24----------
what i'm hearing from you sauron is that


---------89:26----------
that like really if you guys have three


---------89:28----------
match days and like one day of practice


---------89:30----------
between matches that really doesn't


---------89:31----------
sound like there's a whole lot of time


---------89:32----------
to do anything else


---------89:36----------
yeah so i'm i know that sounds kind of


---------89:39----------
anti-climactic but i think i'm going to


---------89:40----------
have to


---------89:41----------
take a step back from what i was saying


---------89:43----------
earlier


---------89:45----------
because that really does sound quite


---------89:47----------
different to me um


---------89:49----------
but i i still think the general like


---------89:51----------
idea of of


---------89:53----------
you know not letting the sensation of


---------89:55----------
like and in that case i i think the


---------89:57----------
reason that


---------89:58----------
you know you shouldn't scale back is not


---------90:00----------
because you feel weak but because


---------90:02----------
there's actually like a necessity


---------90:04----------
you guys have eight hours of practice


---------90:05----------
but essentially it sounds like you guys


---------90:06----------
have one day of practice before a match


---------90:10----------
um monday we have a day off and then


---------90:12----------
tuesday wednesday thursday we practice


---------90:13----------
and then we have


---------90:14----------
friday saturday sunday three matches in


---------90:16----------
a row oh i see


---------90:17----------
so that's so yeah it still sounds super


---------90:20----------
tight from a scheduling standpoint


---------90:22----------
so i i know it sounds kind of i've been


---------90:24----------
trying to avoid asking you details of


---------90:26----------
your schedule just for


---------90:27----------
like that's everyone's practice


---------90:29----------
schedules okay


---------90:31----------
um yeah i'm gonna have to accept some


---------90:33----------
some teams that


---------90:35----------
obviously don't take an off day


---------90:37----------
sometimes or push the


---------90:39----------
training schedule longer on some other


---------90:41----------
days because we have less practice days


---------90:42----------
and things like that but


---------90:45----------
i'm trying to figure out how to salvage


---------90:47----------
my argument because i i feel like i just


---------90:49----------
torpedoed it


---------90:52----------
um so i still think that there's like


---------90:55----------
a broader point here i don't know about


---------90:57----------
this particular schedule


---------90:59----------
but i'm getting the sense that you're


---------91:01----------
still motivated by a lot of like feeling


---------91:04----------
inadequate what do you think about that


---------91:10----------
[Music]


---------91:15----------
yeah i think so so i i think your road


---------91:19----------
forward is still the same in this


---------91:20----------
particular instance i don't think


---------91:22----------
it and i i i don't know if this makes


---------91:25----------
sense but


---------91:26----------
i still don't think that the reason you


---------91:28----------
sh so you shouldn't meet with your ceo


---------91:30----------
on a tuesday wednesday thursday that


---------91:31----------
makes perfect sense to me


---------91:34----------
at the same time i think the reason you


---------91:36----------
shouldn't meet with them


---------91:38----------
is not because you feel weak but it's


---------91:40----------
like literally you just don't have time


---------91:42----------
because you've got to work


---------91:44----------
do you understand how there's a


---------91:45----------
difference there


---------91:47----------
[Music]


---------91:52----------
kind of but there is time


---------91:56----------
there is time for what


---------92:00----------
i could have a meeting do you think that


---------92:03----------
that would


---------92:06----------
what would be the cost of that meeting


---------92:08----------
if you met with the ceo on tuesday


---------92:23----------
just kind of the flexibility of my


---------92:26----------
time i guess those days where we end up


---------92:28----------
practice


---------92:30----------
it differs but maybe the average


---------92:32----------
practice day we ended like 6 30 or seven


---------92:34----------
and then i am kind of flexible to


---------92:38----------
do i want to stay at the office and work


---------92:40----------
do i want to


---------92:42----------
relax and hang out with my players and


---------92:43----------
staff do i want to go home but if i have


---------92:45----------
that meeting then


---------92:46----------
no matter kind of how i feel maybe how


---------92:48----------
how stressed i am on the day i have to


---------92:49----------
do this thing


---------92:52----------
it's nice to have more flexibility


---------92:54----------
because some practice days are


---------92:56----------
are really hard and really taxing okay


---------92:58----------
so i i think that that makes sense that


---------93:00----------
you want flexibility so let me ask you


---------93:02----------
this have you noticed


---------93:03----------
anything in your schedule that is driven


---------93:06----------
by the sense


---------93:08----------
of feeling like if you didn't do that


---------93:10----------
you would be weak


---------93:28----------
if i didn't do that i would be weak


---------93:35----------
sorry do you mind asking one more time


---------93:36----------
yeah sorry i i think we're kind of


---------93:38----------
getting like lost in the weeds here but


---------93:40----------
like here's the general


---------93:41----------
i was hoping that there was an easy


---------93:44----------
application


---------93:45----------
but upon hearing what your schedule is


---------93:47----------
like i don't think there is but here's


---------93:48----------
my general idea okay


---------93:50----------
and and maybe we won't find a specific


---------93:52----------
thing but


---------93:54----------
so in your role as head coach you have


---------93:57----------
certain like work responsibilities which


---------93:59----------
are necessities


---------94:01----------
right like you have to show up for


---------94:03----------
practice you need to strategize you guys


---------94:05----------
need to figure out what heroes you're


---------94:06----------
gonna pick


---------94:07----------
you have to like watch replays from like


---------94:09----------
the matches that you have coming up


---------94:11----------
like all that stuff is like necessary i


---------94:14----------
totally get that


---------94:15----------
what i'm hearing from you and i'm pretty


---------94:17----------
sure that this is sort of like


---------94:19----------
a theme that we've sort of uncovered is


---------94:22----------
that at times


---------94:23----------
your actions are not motivated by the


---------94:25----------
necessity of the job and if you really


---------94:28----------
tunnel down and you become highly aware


---------94:30----------
you'll notice that they're not actually


---------94:32----------
they make look like what is necessary in


---------94:35----------
the job


---------94:36----------
but really what it is is you feel


---------94:39----------
like you would be weak or you'd be


---------94:41----------
letting your players down


---------94:42----------
if you like


---------94:46----------
didn't do this thing so some actions are


---------94:49----------
motivated by necessity and some actions


---------94:51----------
are motivated by avoiding feeling weak


---------94:55----------
yeah i think the that kind of gray area


---------95:00----------
a lot of it for me is how much i'm


---------95:03----------
studying


---------95:04----------
the other regions play because there's


---------95:05----------
an infinite amount of games from other


---------95:07----------
regions


---------95:08----------
that's really where i think as a coach


---------95:10----------
you can really


---------95:11----------
put in the hours and


---------95:16----------
there's not a necessity for me to watch


---------95:17----------
all the games because it's simply not


---------95:19----------
possible


---------95:20----------
but i think that's where


---------95:24----------
a lot of the times i feel inadequate if


---------95:26----------
i'm not up to date if i don't if i


---------95:28----------
didn't watch the matches from last night


---------95:31----------
um


---------95:35----------
yeah i think that's probably one of the


---------95:37----------
bigger ones that come to mind


---------95:38----------
yeah so that that's i think that's a


---------95:40----------
great example because that's something


---------95:41----------
where like you could do work and it's


---------95:43----------
reasonable for you to do work


---------95:46----------
but i don't know exactly how you find


---------95:48----------
this i think it's going to be through


---------95:49----------
some self-reflection


---------95:51----------
but right now you somehow decide how


---------95:54----------
much to watch


---------95:54----------
right like there's some internal


---------95:57----------
calculus that on week to week like you


---------95:59----------
either watch a lot or you watch less or


---------96:01----------
whatever


---------96:05----------
[Music]


---------96:09----------
yeah it's kind of a difficult thing it's


---------96:13----------
one of those things that i i haven't


---------96:14----------
really been able to balance


---------96:16----------
i'll watch a lot and then maybe i will


---------96:19----------
kind of burn out and then need to take


---------96:21----------
more time and then i will barely watch


---------96:23----------
and i can't find this healthy


---------96:25----------
exactly exactly so now i feel like this


---------96:28----------
is salvageable


---------96:29----------
because i think that that pattern of


---------96:30----------
burnout or


---------96:32----------
like a ton of work followed by burnout


---------96:34----------
is a hundred percent


---------96:36----------
what you see when someone is driven by a


---------96:37----------
negative emotion


---------96:39----------
right because you're beating yourself up


---------96:40----------
you're like i'm inadequate i need to


---------96:41----------
watch more i need to watch more i need


---------96:43----------
to watch more


---------96:44----------
and then you actually burn yourself out


---------96:46----------
and then you don't watch and this is


---------96:47----------
what i'm saying in


---------96:49----------
in terms of optimizing performance is


---------96:52----------
that


---------96:52----------
if you pay attention to that feeling


---------96:55----------
that drives you to watch to the point of


---------96:57----------
burnout


---------96:58----------
and you don't let that control you on


---------97:01----------
balance i'd say


---------97:02----------
four out of five people that find a way


---------97:04----------
to balance that the way to balance it is


---------97:06----------
actually your feeling of inadequacy at


---------97:08----------
the beginning because that's what's


---------97:10----------
driving you to burn out in the first


---------97:11----------
place


---------97:14----------
yeah and so if you can oh


---------97:17----------
become aware of that feeling of


---------97:19----------
inadequacy and


---------97:20----------
and not be driven by it then you


---------97:23----------
actually won't burn out


---------97:25----------
and if you won't burn out you'll


---------97:26----------
actually end up watching more matches


---------97:28----------
more productively than you would in the


---------97:30----------
way that you are right now


---------97:32----------
yeah i agree 100 so the key there is


---------97:35----------
going to be that like


---------97:36----------
sort of deciding like how like sort of


---------97:39----------
from a


---------97:40----------
tranquil state of mind how many hours of


---------97:42----------
things you're going to watch


---------97:44----------
and once you sort of make like an


---------97:45----------
initial determination


---------97:47----------
if you feel inadequate in the middle


---------97:51----------
you have to try really hard to at least


---------97:53----------
be aware of that


---------97:54----------
and then ask yourself this question


---------97:56----------
because remember whether you if you


---------97:57----------
don't watch the game we're screwed and


---------97:58----------
if you do watch the game you're screwed


---------98:00----------
but just ask you know that's the paradox


---------98:02----------
we were talking about just ask yourself


---------98:04----------
am i watching this game because i feel


---------98:07----------
inadequate


---------98:09----------
am i watching this game because i feel


---------98:12----------
like i'd be letting my team down


---------98:14----------
even though i don't feel like watching


---------98:16----------
it even though i'm tired


---------98:19----------
am i doing this because i don't you know


---------98:21----------
because of that feeling the skull


---------98:26----------
do you think you could ask yourself that


---------98:28----------
question


---------98:36----------
and when when the answer is inevitably


---------98:39----------
sometimes going to be that i am doing it


---------98:41----------
because of those things and what i do


---------98:43----------
what do you think you do


---------98:56----------
uh


---------99:00----------
[Music]


---------99:05----------
something i've been trying to do more


---------99:06----------
recently is just


---------99:08----------
kind of sit with those feelings more


---------99:11----------
good


---------99:12----------
that's the right thing yeah so like i


---------99:15----------
know it sounds weird but whether you


---------99:16----------
watch the game this is what's really


---------99:18----------
confusing for a lot of people about like


---------99:19----------
self-growth


---------99:21----------
the actual action you take at the end of


---------99:23----------
the day is not rewiring the neurons


---------99:27----------
what rewires the neurons is asking


---------99:29----------
yourself the question and being able to


---------99:30----------
authentically answer it


---------99:32----------
i know it sounds really weird but as


---------99:34----------
long as you ask yourself the question


---------99:36----------
and authentically answer it you will


---------99:38----------
move one step closer to balance


---------99:43----------
because on some days your mind is gonna


---------99:45----------
actually generate the thought and it'll


---------99:46----------
say


---------99:47----------
you know what you can take a break


---------99:51----------
and on other days it's gonna be like you


---------99:52----------
know what you really can't deserve to


---------99:54----------
take


---------99:54----------
you don't deserve to take a break you


---------99:55----------
need to watch this and we can't know


---------99:58----------
which one your mind is gonna produce and


---------100:00----------
it's actually fine


---------100:01----------
either one it produces is okay the key


---------100:03----------
thing is asking yourself the question


---------100:05----------
and coming up with an authentic


---------100:06----------
awareness


---------100:07----------
of what's driving you


---------100:13----------
that makes sense yeah


---------100:17----------
thoughts questions about today


---------100:20----------
i know things got super abstract and


---------100:22----------
confusing there at the end


---------100:24----------
so sorry about that no no that that was


---------100:27----------
really helpful


---------100:28----------
because i


---------100:32----------
i am definitely aware that i didn't have


---------100:35----------
a healthy relationship with


---------100:37----------
that aspect of my work especially


---------100:47----------
and then one last thought


---------100:51----------
is when it comes to social relationships


---------100:54----------
things like that


---------100:54----------
or like you know non-professional things


---------100:58----------
i would encourage you to pay a lot of


---------101:00----------
attention once again to that feeling of


---------101:02----------
inadequacy


---------101:05----------
right and try to figure out like you


---------101:07----------
know what which of your actions is being


---------101:09----------
driven by that feeling


---------101:11----------
and the more that you become aware of it


---------101:13----------
the more it'll start to dissolve


---------101:23----------
and then the last question that i'll


---------101:24----------
leave you with which is i think


---------101:26----------
ultimately soaring the one that you're


---------101:27----------
gonna have to answer for yourself and


---------101:28----------
this is for everyone listening to


---------101:31----------
if you feel inadequate you really have


---------101:33----------
to pay be careful


---------101:34----------
about how you respond


---------101:38----------
to people that tell you otherwise


---------101:41----------
right because i think the biggest issue


---------101:42----------
here is that like


---------101:44----------
you don't it's a lose-lose situation


---------101:48----------
like no matter like if if your teammates


---------101:49----------
say like yeah like you're doing


---------101:51----------
fantastic you're gonna swat that down


---------101:53----------
if i say it you're gonna swat that down


---------101:55----------
sometimes people like the people that we


---------101:56----------
care about us like when we're feeling


---------101:58----------
inadequate we'll swat down what they say


---------102:01----------
and you really have to like understand


---------102:03----------
where that comes from


---------102:05----------
like why are you so quick to swat down


---------102:07----------
what other people say


---------102:18----------
yeah definitely when i used to get


---------102:20----------
compliments i would


---------102:22----------
pretty much answer in like uh


---------102:25----------
thanks but you don't know me yeah but i


---------102:28----------
learned the socially acceptable thing is


---------102:29----------
just to


---------102:31----------
even even if i don't truly believe it to


---------102:33----------
still


---------102:34----------
yep well to try not to show that because


---------102:36----------
that's a very disrespectful thing to


---------102:38----------
show yeah so i understand that you


---------102:40----------
learned socially what to say but then


---------102:42----------
the question is like


---------102:43----------
like what not on the inside and i think


---------102:46----------
it's hard for you to answer this but


---------102:47----------
like what is it that


---------102:48----------
we don't know about you right when you


---------102:50----------
say when your mind says you don't know


---------102:52----------
me


---------102:52----------
it implies there's something inside you


---------102:54----------
that people don't know like they don't


---------102:56----------
know something about you


---------102:57----------
but when i ask you what that thing is


---------102:59----------
like i'm not


---------103:00----------
hearing anything no i've


---------103:10----------
i've definitely made a lot of progress


---------103:11----------
in when people


---------103:13----------
give me a compliment or say nice things


---------103:14----------
about me that a lot of the time i i do


---------103:17----------
genuinely believe it


---------103:18----------
whereas maybe


---------103:21----------
five years ago i would never yeah so so


---------103:24----------
i don't i don't feel


---------103:29----------
constantly inadequate yeah yeah um


---------103:33----------
yeah i i i hope i didn't give


---------103:36----------
you the impression that i feel that


---------103:37----------
that's how you feel oh no that that's


---------103:40----------
that is how i felt in the past yeah i'm


---------103:42----------
just saying that


---------103:44----------
it's not that i always have that


---------103:45----------
response so like oh you don't know me


---------103:47----------
you don't know what's wrong with me


---------103:48----------
uh so so here's what i've


---------103:53----------
found when people have that kind of


---------103:54----------
response like you don't know me


---------103:57----------
the more you tunnel down and look where


---------103:59----------
that response comes


---------104:00----------
from the more it dissolves


---------104:04----------
because usually that response like is a


---------104:07----------
leftover emotion


---------104:09----------
from a traumatic experience earlier in


---------104:11----------
your life


---------104:14----------
it's like you carry that sense of


---------104:15----------
inadequacy or like


---------104:18----------
like imagine what you were taught to


---------104:20----------
believe


---------104:21----------
about yourself between the fourth and


---------104:23----------
eighth grade


---------104:26----------
like the sense of identity and so like


---------104:28----------
what happens is when someone compliments


---------104:30----------
you is that


---------104:31----------
part of your identity which was formed


---------104:33----------
back then


---------104:34----------
kind of like rises to the surface and


---------104:36----------
tries to swat down the compliment


---------104:39----------
whereas now like like how old are you


---------104:41----------
soren ballpark


---------104:42----------
25 okay so like when we look at soren


---------104:45----------
like 25 year old sorin who's won the


---------104:47----------
north american championships and is


---------104:49----------
you know head coach and all this other


---------104:51----------
good stuff like that person has


---------104:53----------
a lot of authentic reasons to feel good


---------104:56----------
about themselves


---------104:57----------
and to feel proud of what they've


---------104:58----------
accomplished and things like that


---------105:00----------
but inside you there's also like eighth


---------105:03----------
grade soren who gets


---------105:04----------
chucked over the wall and like that


---------105:08----------
echo the echo of that identity is what


---------105:11----------
rebels against


---------105:13----------
the compliment and the more you tunnel


---------105:16----------
down and you say why am i swatting this


---------105:18----------
compliment away the more you look for it


---------105:20----------
you're actually not going to find an


---------105:21----------
answer


---------105:21----------
it's just going to be that feeling and


---------105:24----------
the more you do that process of looking


---------105:26----------
for why you're swatting down the


---------105:27----------
compliment


---------105:28----------
the less that feeling the more that


---------105:30----------
feeling will kind of go down


---------105:32----------
and then you'll be kind of like go walk


---------105:35----------
around not feeling


---------105:36----------
you know like occasionally like you're


---------105:37----------
weak like it emerges at times right


---------105:41----------
it's like open up weakness.exe and then


---------105:44----------
it runs for five minutes and then it


---------105:45----------
closes down


---------105:48----------
okay yeah that's really helpful


---------105:53----------
thoughts questions


---------105:59----------
um yeah this is really


---------106:02----------
insightful thanks for having me on the


---------106:04----------
stream


---------106:05----------
guess what i'm thinking


---------106:10----------
what i'm saying oh he's just saying that


---------106:12----------
to be nice


---------106:14----------
no no definitely not


---------106:17----------
oh i mean that was part of what i was i


---------106:20----------
guess what a lot of people


---------106:21----------
hope for when they talk to you and i'll


---------106:24----------
definitely have to go back and re-watch


---------106:25----------
and


---------106:26----------
think a little bit more about this stuff


---------106:28----------
you seem to have a very contemplative


---------106:30----------
face so i had some trouble kind of


---------106:32----------
reading where you are right now can you


---------106:34----------
help me understand like where you are


---------106:35----------
right now


---------106:37----------
contemplative face yeah you are you have


---------106:40----------
a thinking face


---------106:41----------
you seem to be thinking a lot


---------106:45----------
i think i'm just a thinker i think


---------106:47----------
that's possible


---------106:49----------
um can you help me understand what was


---------106:51----------
helpful or what was insightful about


---------106:53----------
today


---------106:55----------
[Music]


---------107:06----------
um


---------107:14----------
just kind of understanding better why i


---------107:17----------
am the way i am


---------107:18----------
and some of the


---------107:22----------
i guess complexes that i have and


---------107:25----------
bringing more self-awareness to them and


---------107:27----------
maybe understanding a little bit more


---------107:29----------
where they come from of course i know


---------107:30----------
that my past is affecting me in the


---------107:32----------
present but


---------107:34----------
not always so


---------107:37----------
aware as to how or how to help it


---------107:41----------
um and


---------107:47----------
it definitely it's a little bit blurry


---------107:48----------
the the


---------107:51----------
the kind of toxic feelings of inadequacy


---------107:53----------
versus the more


---------107:55----------
like you said like the necessity of what


---------107:58----------
i have to do


---------108:00----------
uh sometimes it's hard to tell the


---------108:03----------
difference


---------108:06----------
um


---------108:09----------
what do you think is well i guess i


---------108:12----------
already kind of know the answer but


---------108:13----------
i assume that meditation is a good way


---------108:15----------
to kind of cultivate that


---------108:16----------
self-awareness


---------108:19----------
in your thinking and your patterns and


---------108:21----------
things like that


---------108:22----------
what do you think


---------108:29----------
i think so but it's a habit that i've


---------108:30----------
never really been able to it's never


---------108:32----------
been able to stick with me for some


---------108:33----------
reason


---------108:35----------
maybe because it's driven by my


---------108:36----------
inadequacy


---------108:39----------
when i do it ah tell me about that


---------108:46----------
what happens when you try to meditate


---------108:47----------
sorry


---------108:52----------
[Music]


---------108:56----------
what happens when i try to meditate


---------109:01----------
uh it's not like a super uncomfortable


---------109:03----------
experience for anything i just have a


---------109:04----------
hard time


---------109:06----------
just sitting down and getting it done i


---------109:09----------
think a lot of the things that i do


---------109:10----------
there's a very clear motivation to it


---------109:13----------
but with meditation i don't really have


---------109:15----------
one


---------109:20----------
even though i know it's it's it's good


---------109:22----------
for you but


---------109:25----------
let me think about this for a second


---------109:28----------
sure


---------109:33----------
so your first question was how do you


---------109:34----------
gain self-awareness


---------109:40----------
i have had kind of bouts of meditating


---------109:43----------
consistently and i definitely noticed


---------109:49----------
especially an increased awareness of


---------109:51----------
when i was really present and when i'm


---------109:53----------
not


---------109:53----------
when i'm really in my own head


---------109:58----------
um do you want an easy meditation


---------110:01----------
technique or a hard meditation technique


---------110:06----------
whatever you think is i'm gonna give you


---------110:08----------
a super hard one


---------110:10----------
okay so


---------110:16----------
oh we're gonna practice quickly i want


---------110:18----------
you to sit up straight


---------110:20----------
so i want you to as you breathe in


---------110:24----------
through your nose


---------110:26----------
say the word strength in your mind and


---------110:29----------
as you breathe out i want you to say the


---------110:31----------
word weakness


---------110:32----------
in your mind


---------110:35----------
just do one breath


---------110:43----------
were you able to do it


---------110:46----------
okay now comes the hard part


---------110:50----------
every time you walk through a door a


---------110:53----------
doorway


---------110:54----------
i want you to breathe to yourself and


---------110:57----------
inhale strength


---------110:58----------
and exhale weakness


---------111:03----------
i think i would feel really silly doing


---------111:05----------
that but yeah you don't have to say it


---------111:08----------
right so it just has to be an internal


---------111:10----------
thing like just


---------111:12----------
and if the strength and weakness feels


---------111:14----------
weird to you you can even let go of that


---------111:16----------
just inhale and exhale every time you


---------111:18----------
walk through a doorway


---------111:22----------
okay how does that feel to you


---------111:25----------
is the strength weakness part a little


---------111:26----------
bit cheesy


---------111:30----------
[Music]


---------111:32----------
a little bit so i'll leave that one up


---------111:35----------
to you


---------111:35----------
i had a therapist years ago that


---------111:38----------
made me do a lot of uh kind of


---------111:41----------
affirmations


---------111:43----------
and positive affirmations you know stuff


---------111:46----------
never really clicked with me


---------111:48----------
perfect let's let's swap it around we're


---------111:50----------
going to inhale weakness and breathe out


---------111:52----------
strength how about that


---------111:57----------
that sounds great does that feel more


---------111:59----------
comfortable for you


---------112:02----------
uh


---------112:07----------
sounds a little depressing to be honest


---------112:10----------
so


---------112:10----------
so so which you tell me that


---------112:14----------
no i i i it's


---------112:19----------
the inhaling strength of the excellence


---------112:21----------
is not it's not bad


---------112:22----------
it was more having to look at myself in


---------112:24----------
the mirror and say these things out loud


---------112:26----------
i thought it was


---------112:27----------
very cheesy but no but you're not


---------112:29----------
looking at anything we're not


---------112:30----------
no not with you i was referring back to


---------112:32----------
what like yeah i think positive i think


---------112:34----------
positive affirmations are terrible


---------112:36----------
i think you're not not what i would


---------112:38----------
recommend for you


---------112:40----------
and and and i encourage you i know this


---------112:42----------
sounds kind of weird soren but i


---------112:43----------
encourage you


---------112:44----------
to like actually play around with it so


---------112:47----------
by all means


---------112:51----------
do weakness and strength or strength and


---------112:53----------
weakness whichever way you want to do it


---------112:56----------
you can do both or neither


---------112:59----------
the key thing is going to be going


---------113:00----------
through the doorway but if it feels


---------113:02----------
cheesy for you maybe that can be good


---------113:05----------
and if it feels depressing that can be


---------113:07----------
good and just play around with it right


---------113:08----------
because it's two sides of the same coin


---------113:11----------
i don't think cheesy's


---------113:13----------
necessarily a bad thing okay


---------113:16----------
so try that it's gonna be really really


---------113:19----------
hard


---------113:21----------
okay like this is like a you know uh


---------113:27----------
like a professional level technique and


---------113:29----------
the reason is because our brain is


---------113:30----------
actually


---------113:31----------
wired to reset our thought process


---------113:34----------
anytime we go through a doorway


---------113:36----------
it's why i don't know if you've ever


---------113:37----------
experienced this but if you walk like


---------113:39----------
you'll walk into a room and you'll be


---------113:40----------
like why did i walk into this room what


---------113:41----------
was i doing


---------113:43----------
it's actually this weird thing about


---------113:45----------
doorways but it's like the best way to


---------113:47----------
cultivate self-awareness because it's so


---------113:49----------
hard


---------113:53----------
okay okay that's the meditation


---------113:56----------
all right any last day meditation


---------114:00----------
yep you're right it is an all-day


---------114:02----------
meditation


---------114:04----------
would anything less be sufficient for


---------114:06----------
you


---------114:08----------
uh i guess not


---------114:12----------
right so the other thing is that


---------114:14----------
sometimes i use this meditation


---------114:15----------
technique to trick people into


---------114:17----------
meditating normally because they try


---------114:19----------
this for


---------114:19----------
a week and they're like this is terrible


---------114:21----------
i'm just gonna sit down for five minutes


---------114:23----------
and meditate normally which if you


---------114:25----------
decide to do that that's totally fine


---------114:27----------
too


---------114:28----------
but give it a shot um all right


---------114:31----------
and any last thoughts or questions


---------114:33----------
before we wrap up for the day


---------114:37----------
um no


---------114:41----------
