---------00:46----------
exactly exactly so as I was saying that


---------00:49----------
usually when I'm talking to someone I


---------00:51----------
mean they require a hundred percent of


---------00:54----------
my attention or I try to give them a


---------00:55----------
hundred percent of my attention and and


---------00:58----------
yeah I mean I couldn't do what I do if I


---------01:02----------
was having a conversation with like ten


---------01:04----------
thousand people I'm having conversation


---------01:06----------

---------01:08----------

---------01:21----------
chat clothes or chat is open on those go


---------01:24----------
okay so we just a noun you should we


---------01:26----------
turn off the stream and troll them and


---------01:28----------
talk for an hour in private


---------01:31----------
remind you like it I'm so glad we did


---------01:34----------
this


---------01:34----------
good got then yeah um can't control us


---------01:41----------
but we control them too yeah yeah yeah


---------01:45----------
we did way harder to like I remember


---------01:49----------
soda one time however he just turned a


---------01:52----------
stream on it and it was like the opening


---------01:54----------
screen like this starting soon screening


---------01:56----------
and he just never went on that it was


---------01:58----------
there for like I don't know like a


---------01:59----------
couple hours and it just turned it off


---------02:05----------
yeah so what do you want I think that


---------02:09----------
sounds great by the way and what am i


---------02:10----------
calling you bro Felix


---------02:13----------
okay Felix Felix um wait what does feel


---------02:20----------
is that a name oh no I thought you said


---------02:22----------
feel I've misheard you


---------02:23----------
on the off Felix or ecstasy either okay


---------02:26----------
there's good Felix okay yeah so Felix


---------02:30----------
what what do you want I'm completely in


---------02:32----------
favor of what you said earlier about


---------02:33----------
just like having a conversation between


---------02:34----------
two people


---------02:35----------
oh yeah exactly um well I want to have


---------02:38----------
like it's an approach with it would


---------02:39----------
topics more like uh you know she's like


---------02:42----------
open or just like a like talk if you


---------02:45----------
like safe like some hoop leaves it


---------02:46----------
somewheres go through it you know


---------02:48----------
absolutely man it's awesome I mean


---------02:51----------
there's like a couple things that that I


---------02:55----------
have that I had it that I like I've seen


---------02:59----------
on the show some but I don't want like


---------03:01----------
to redo things that you already like


---------03:03----------
talked about too much you know make it


---------03:05----------
like I don't know the intent yeah you


---------03:08----------
mean you don't want to talk about


---------03:09----------
something that someone else has talked


---------03:11----------
about um not not like directly like that


---------03:15----------
just like I've listened some of the


---------03:19----------
advice throughout that topic is that


---------03:20----------
make sense sure but so I I don't think


---------03:23----------
we can redo anything by the way cuz


---------03:26----------
you're a different person


---------03:27----------
okay right so true so I think that if


---------03:31----------
I've learned one thing like so you know


---------03:33----------
let's say I work with a hundred people


---------03:34----------
with depression it's not a script right


---------03:38----------
each person's unique each person's


---------03:40----------
challenge even though there's something


---------03:42----------
that we share there's like something


---------03:45----------
that's unique and different about who we


---------03:46----------
are as people and that's why like you


---------03:48----------
can't watch a conversation with another


---------03:50----------
human being and then that doesn't apply


---------03:52----------
a hundred percent to you so I get what


---------03:54----------
you're saying but I would also say like


---------03:56----------
don't how can i I almost get a sense of


---------04:01----------
service in the way that you're talking


---------04:04----------
right now it's almost like saying like


---------04:06----------
we shouldn't like cuz you've already


---------04:08----------
talked about this before so like we we


---------04:11----------
don't need to talk about it with me but


---------04:13----------
I'm saying okay if that's important to


---------04:15----------
you we should absolutely talk about it


---------04:16----------
and who they all cares about what we've


---------04:18----------
said in the past with other people


---------04:19----------
mmm-hmm so what you want to talk about


---------04:22----------
Felix um well I had thinking knows like


---------04:26----------
over the


---------04:27----------
possible months or whatever like stuff


---------04:29----------
like um just like generic like issues


---------04:31----------
that I think most simmers like have not


---------04:33----------
like issues but you know like a mental


---------04:37----------
religious yeah you know stuff like


---------04:43----------
impostor syndrome stuff like


---------04:47----------
self-sabotage or whatever okay which is


---------04:51----------
I I think sometimes like we'll probably


---------04:54----------
one of my um not favorite but like


---------04:57----------
what's something that I nice see more


---------05:00----------
often than myself so right tell me in


---------05:03----------
what ways do you sabotage yourself you


---------05:08----------
know the the analogy always give is kind


---------05:13----------
of like when you play a game and you get


---------05:15----------
a certain rank right that's like really


---------05:16----------
good and you're really proud of yourself


---------05:18----------
huh a lot of times even if I have it I'm


---------05:23----------
happy with it I'll feel like if I play a


---------05:27----------
game or two and I'm not good and I'm


---------05:29----------
doing good


---------05:30----------
I'll feel like I want to lose that rank


---------05:33----------
right just so I could get it back just


---------05:36----------
like you feel like I deserve it does it


---------05:38----------
make sense yeah I go ahead no go ahead I


---------05:44----------
feel like I do that


---------05:45----------
a lot of things almost everything I did


---------05:48----------
that that exact same thing or I'll


---------05:50----------
purposely like destroy a part of


---------05:52----------
something just like it again it so I


---------05:54----------
could feel like I deserve it


---------05:59----------
yeah I think that makes a lot of sense


---------06:02----------
so it's almost as if you it's almost as


---------06:08----------
if you need to gain that rank to show


---------06:12----------
yourself that you deserve to be there


---------06:15----------
yeah and and getting there once isn't


---------06:19----------
enough that's never enough so let's


---------06:24----------
think about that why do you think that


---------06:26----------
is


---------06:28----------
sounds tiring by the way to constantly


---------06:31----------
need to prove your worth um yeah it's


---------06:36----------
super tiny yeah I setup where you get


---------06:40----------
two different internets right and you


---------06:43----------
get it installed to where like they're


---------06:45----------
both going in and if one fails the other


---------06:47----------
one kicks in Oh interesting I've never


---------06:49----------
I've never heard of that yeah see if I


---------06:52----------
could there we go


---------06:53----------
all right sorry about that so yeah


---------06:56----------
actually you know what in terms of in


---------06:58----------
terms of mindset with you I think


---------07:01----------
shimmers I've talked to like crows most


---------07:03----------
rumors about this and I have not found


---------07:06----------
one person who disagrees that dropped


---------07:10----------
frames lag server problems internet


---------07:16----------
problems loss trimmings one the most


---------07:17----------
discouraging thing ever I don't think


---------07:20----------
anything comes close to that yeah so it


---------07:23----------
was interesting you know as the internet


---------07:26----------
went on again because this happened on


---------07:29----------
Friday when we were talking to polka


---------07:31----------
main and and like it was so interesting


---------07:35----------
to feel my reactions cuz at first I was


---------07:38----------
like super super angry because that's


---------07:40----------
like what what the fudge yeah you know


---------07:43----------
cuz I so after Friday I like made sure


---------07:46----------
everything is okay like tested our


---------07:48----------
router like everything's fine we called


---------07:50----------
our ISP and they were actually doing


---------07:52----------
maintenance in the middle of the


---------07:54----------
afternoon on Friday which is why


---------07:55----------
everyone out and so then I was like okay


---------07:57----------
fine so it looks like we're done


---------07:59----------
like no more maintenance then sure


---------08:01----------
enough and I can you know I can play


---------08:03----------
games for like eight hours and our


---------08:05----------
internet doesn't go out at all it's like


---------08:07----------
yeah exactly and and no problem if I'm


---------08:09----------
just hanging out with my friends but


---------08:10----------
when you're you know streaming with one


---------08:12----------
of the biggest people on Twitch then


---------08:13----------
suddenly your internet is like get


---------08:16----------
[ __ ] kid yeah that's so annoying about


---------08:19----------
it and so I was thinking a little bit


---------08:22----------
about okay I can't really do a whole lot


---------08:24----------
about it so let's just I decided to get


---------08:26----------
myself some water and and yeah you had


---------08:31----------
my kid


---------08:32----------
egg okay and you have a kid or like a


---------08:36----------
lot of them


---------08:37----------
I have something between a and a lot


---------08:39----------
I've got two oh yes I've like think


---------08:47----------
about this I don't know why but yeah


---------08:49----------
okay but I can I see your um your face


---------08:52----------
yeah you can't see my face on discord no


---------08:56----------
[ __ ] this is happening again okay hold


---------08:58----------
on come on we fixed this hold on hold on


---------09:01----------
how do we do this oh yeah yeah hit hit


---------09:03----------
hit the gridview oh wait yeah you're


---------09:08----------
right wait I can see your face okay okay


---------09:12----------
not always my fault okay yeah do you


---------09:20----------
like to like see yourself while you're


---------09:22----------
showing it because do I sort of person


---------09:25----------
yeah


---------09:26----------
do you have any way on your screen that


---------09:27----------
you can see yourself while you're


---------09:30----------
streaming you I think your antenna I


---------09:32----------
used to not have that now I do okay so


---------09:36----------
no so now they changed my layout to


---------09:38----------
where I can see my face on the screen


---------09:41----------
why do you do you like that what do you


---------09:44----------
ask


---------09:49----------
I don't like it I don't like it what do


---------09:53----------
you tell if I get about it


---------09:54----------
it feels disingenuous to what I want to


---------10:00----------
do why what to do I want to chill be


---------10:07----------
like more like organic stuff and I feel


---------10:09----------
like sometimes see myself what kind of


---------10:11----------
reminds me oh man this is like this is


---------10:14----------
camera this is film this is whatever I


---------10:16----------
feel like it's a it's a constant like it


---------10:18----------
bring back all the time kind of realism


---------10:20----------
back like a like a fishing rod you know


---------10:22----------
yeah so if I'm if I'm hearing you what


---------10:25----------
I'd say is that what you're really going


---------10:27----------
for is like immersion for almost like a


---------10:29----------
flow state where you're a hundred


---------10:31----------
percent with what you're doing yeah and


---------10:34----------
and when you see yourself on camera it's


---------10:37----------
sort of like reminds you that Felix like


---------10:41----------
this is like we're streaming there are


---------10:43----------
people watching there's all this other


---------10:45----------
thing and then you're not you're not


---------10:46----------
present at the task that you're doing


---------10:48----------
yeah okay that sounds that sounds bad


---------10:53----------
I do a lot of small things in there and


---------10:56----------
like my my I did my setup in my daily


---------10:58----------
life I feel like to maintain that state


---------11:01----------
you know sometimes I like I try too hard


---------11:04----------
to keep that state I still do it I don't


---------11:09----------
know why but I still do it what when you


---------11:12----------
say that state you mean the flow state


---------11:14----------
like the state of being present just


---------11:17----------
like stuff with like the way I arrange


---------11:20----------
my things or the way that I go that


---------11:22----------
going go on with my day like I have


---------11:26----------
problems doing stuff before stream or


---------11:30----------
doing stuff that no that was good doing


---------11:33----------
stuff before stream is really hard I


---------11:35----------
like to like tunnel vision and then wake


---------11:38----------
up and have one mindset one need one


---------11:40----------
want and I just go into that and I just


---------11:43----------
follow it along


---------11:44----------
does that make sense and whenever I do


---------11:46----------
something before stream I feel like I'm


---------11:48----------
I'm somewhere and then I go to what at


---------11:51----------
what to what I want to do right and


---------11:54----------
there's a big like I'm just


---------11:57----------
in an odd state and I can always it


---------12:02----------
always happens you know yeah it's very


---------12:04----------
principled and I always get upset at


---------12:07----------
that I think it's a bad effect when you


---------12:10----------
say you get upset you get upset by not


---------12:12----------
being as clear-headed as if you start


---------12:14----------
right away yeah I'm like I feel


---------12:18----------
disconnected and that's not what I want


---------12:20----------
to put out stuff what I want to be and I


---------12:22----------
feel like uh I don't know it as you


---------12:26----------
don't feel like I'm you know worth my


---------12:28----------
own stage or whatever does that make


---------12:30----------
sense


---------12:30----------
no like yes it's like yeah there are two


---------12:35----------
things there okay so Felix you let me


---------12:37----------
know which one you want to talk about


---------12:38----------
one is cognitively in neuro


---------12:41----------
scientifically why it is easier to


---------12:44----------
produce better work when you start first


---------12:47----------
thing after you wake up so this is a


---------12:49----------
concept that's been understood by Yogi's


---------12:51----------
in India for thousands of years and


---------12:53----------
there's a Sun script phrase Brahma


---------12:56----------
mirtha which sort of encapsulates the


---------12:59----------
idea of like starting your day off right


---------13:00----------
we can talk about that the second thing


---------13:04----------
and that's gonna be like a little bit


---------13:06----------
more like teaching the second thing is


---------13:09----------
actually a little bit more subtle and I


---------13:11----------
think maybe a little bit more personal


---------13:13----------
and helpful which is somewhere along the


---------13:16----------
way so you said I don't deserve my own


---------13:18----------
stage right and and this kind of reminds


---------13:21----------
me of what you said earlier about like


---------13:23----------
if you get to a certain rank and then


---------13:27----------
you'd play one or two bad games you feel


---------13:29----------
like you don't deserve that rank so you


---------13:31----------
want to get knocked down so you can


---------13:34----------
reaffirm yourself that you deserve to be


---------13:37----------
where you are and then you want to climb


---------13:39----------
up again because when you climb up then


---------13:41----------
like no you don't take anything for


---------13:43----------
granted


---------13:43----------
right like you started at the bottom and


---------13:45----------
then you climbed up so you're like okay


---------13:47----------
yeah Felix deserves this because I just


---------13:49----------
rose through the ranks yeah and then


---------13:52----------
like coasting is is like well maybe I


---------13:54----------
don't really deserve to be here but if


---------13:55----------
you just rise then you're like


---------13:56----------
absolutely because if I didn't deserve


---------13:58----------
to be here then I wouldn't have been


---------13:59----------
able to climb if I really deserve to be


---------14:01----------
one rank lower than I wouldn't have just


---------14:02----------
won ten games in a row right yeah so the


---------14:05----------
subtle thing there yeah go ahead


---------14:07----------
no you're good the subtle thing there


---------14:09----------
that like really blows my


---------14:10----------
mine felix is like where do you like so


---------14:13----------
if we think about it your sense of


---------14:15----------
intrinsic value is not there you need to


---------14:19----------
climb ranks to assure yourself that you


---------14:22----------
deserve something so why on earth don't


---------14:26----------
you have an intrinsic sense of like what


---------14:29----------
you deserve and I don't know that


---------14:33----------
necessarily that you need to even answer


---------14:35----------
that or that's the second topic right


---------14:37----------
like yeah because if we think about it


---------14:39----------
you know if I move through the world and


---------14:40----------
I walk down the street there's a sense


---------14:43----------
of value that I have that comes from


---------14:45----------
within and there's a sense of value that


---------14:47----------
comes from outside and what I'm noticing


---------14:50----------
in you when you save phrases like


---------14:51----------
imposter syndrome or or you you say


---------14:54----------
things like I don't deserve the stage or


---------14:56----------
you say things like self-sabotage that


---------14:59----------
in my mind tells me that your sense of


---------15:01----------
value internally got like kind of


---------15:04----------
tampered with at some point okay and we


---------15:08----------
can try to figure out why because like


---------15:10----------
all those things are the same does that


---------15:11----------
make sense yeah I think they interact


---------15:15----------
with each other I feel like yeah so so


---------15:17----------
and that just has to get come down to


---------15:19----------
like why don't you think you have value


---------15:20----------
as a person like why don't you think you


---------15:22----------
deserve what you have interesting you


---------15:26----------
know where does that where does that


---------15:28----------
come from because I I don't think people


---------15:30----------
are born that way I think people are


---------15:32----------
born with generally a sense of


---------15:34----------
entitlement right but they deserve what


---------15:37----------
yeah and they're kids and they're kind


---------15:39----------
of narcissistic and then somewhere along


---------15:40----------
the ways things happen to us and then we


---------15:42----------
start to like lose value and who we are


---------15:44----------
as people okay well I would guess that


---------15:48----------
um that I mean it it has to be somewhere


---------15:53----------
cuz I feel I feel like that sense as


---------15:57----------
like almost develops or something into


---------16:00----------
something that is more than just like


---------16:02----------
like simple like that like I said


---------16:04----------
earlier it like almost like a


---------16:05----------
relationship


---------16:07----------
what do that like Otto


---------16:12----------
need it now almost like a almost like I


---------16:15----------
want it almost like I emulated sometimes


---------16:18----------
it's almost like a something I'm


---------16:21----------
familiar with yeah Gramps so I can't


---------16:27----------
tell you a story about a patient of mine


---------16:28----------
sure so I had a patient who had been in


---------16:33----------
in three abusive relationships in a row


---------16:36----------
yep and and what what she needed from


---------16:41----------
her her current partner was just like


---------16:43----------
and so the reason so she had had the


---------16:45----------
three abusive relationships and then had


---------16:47----------
dated a couple of people and essentially


---------16:49----------
kind of drove them away and the reason


---------16:52----------
she kind of drove them away and so she


---------16:54----------
blamed herself for this which is sort of


---------16:56----------
fair is that like you know the


---------16:58----------
relationships weren't abusive and it was


---------17:00----------
kind of confusing to her and so she kind


---------17:02----------
of needed like constant reassurance that


---------17:04----------
like they weren't gonna leave her and


---------17:06----------
then like the more she needed


---------17:08----------
reassurance like the more kind of clingy


---------17:10----------
she became and the more that her


---------17:12----------
prospective boyfriends couldn't handle


---------17:14----------
it and so they ended up like the


---------17:15----------
relationship kind of fell apart and then


---------17:17----------
what happened like it's kind of subtle


---------17:19----------
right so like if I'm let's say that I


---------17:21----------
need reassurance from you and then I ask


---------17:24----------
you for that reassurance and then you


---------17:26----------
give it and the next day I ask and you


---------17:28----------
give it and the next day that I ask and


---------17:29----------
you give it and then eventually you kind


---------17:31----------
of get fed up and you leave what do you


---------17:34----------
think happens to the next person I date


---------17:36----------
how does that relationship look okay I


---------17:42----------
think I understand okay this is I was


---------17:47----------
listening it I was paying too much


---------17:49----------
attention to like the details or I I


---------17:52----------
felt a big picture make sense yeah sure


---------17:54----------
there's a victory of the story and lost


---------17:56----------
it because I understand the specifics


---------17:58----------
yep I see that okay so if I have a


---------18:03----------
relationship where I need a lot of


---------18:05----------
reassurance from someone oh can I Drive


---------18:08----------
it uh-huh


---------18:09----------
and then you stop getting it in the next


---------18:11----------
one or whatever well no so it's not even


---------18:13----------
that I stopped getting it what do you


---------18:15----------
think happens in the next one so like my


---------18:17----------
need for your love once you leave me


---------18:20----------
what happens to how much love I need


---------18:25----------
um no idea actually tell me okay so so


---------18:30----------
what happened with her is that she kind


---------18:32----------
of felt like so that person left right


---------18:36----------
and so the second relationship it's even


---------18:38----------
worse because now someone has abandoned


---------18:41----------
her again and so she needs more and more


---------18:44----------
reassurance and then she drives the


---------18:46----------
second person away and then two people


---------18:48----------
leave and then she's like oh my god I


---------18:50----------
need more and more reassurance


---------18:51----------
she loses value in herself with each


---------18:54----------
relationship and she needs more and more


---------18:56----------
validation from each person and it's a


---------18:59----------
vicious cycle because she can never get


---------19:01----------
enough validation my sense does that


---------19:05----------
make sense and so so but the reason that


---------19:08----------
she can never get enough validation is


---------19:09----------
because she doesn't feel good about


---------19:12----------
herself she doesn't feel like she's


---------19:13----------
unlovable or she feels like she's on


---------19:16----------
muffled she doesn't feel like she is


---------19:18----------
lovable and therefore she needs more


---------19:20----------
validation from alcohol and it's kind of


---------19:23----------
like a vicious cycle because the more


---------19:25----------
validation she gets she doesn't develop


---------19:28----------
confidence in herself okay so her like


---------19:31----------
self reward isn't enough that she needs


---------19:33----------
more from others that becomes unusable


---------19:35----------
like it became and give her it's that


---------19:37----------
it's exactly so she becomes dependent on


---------19:41----------
validation from other people to the


---------19:45----------
point where that validation is almost


---------19:46----------
unattainable because it's too much from


---------19:48----------
a normal relationship yep okay


---------19:50----------
sound familiar


---------19:54----------
yes how so yeah


---------20:01----------
I stood I usually did it I used to do


---------20:03----------
this thing


---------20:05----------
I play overwatch right and I would care


---------20:09----------
lot about just the game and how what I


---------20:13----------
would do


---------20:13----------
how loud perform right so I want you to


---------20:16----------
can I just jump in and pause sorry if


---------20:18----------
I'm derailing you but I don't love what


---------20:20----------
you said


---------20:21----------
I used to Carol I think that's gonna be


---------20:23----------
the answer so please continue okay I'll


---------20:28----------
tell a lot about the actual gameplay and


---------20:31----------
how good I was I would perform at any


---------20:35----------
given time and if I if I felt like I was


---------20:39----------
playing like really bad and I was doing


---------20:41----------
really bad and then I noticed I had a


---------20:44----------
lot of viewers it made me like upset


---------20:48----------
maybe upset that people would tune in


---------20:51----------
and watch such trash gameplay so I would


---------20:55----------
like shave off viewers on purpose like


---------20:57----------
it happened very often what I do things


---------21:00----------
to lose viewers so that I'd be like I


---------21:03----------
lost something I need to get this back


---------21:05----------
I'm gonna play well and then when they


---------21:07----------
cut one of the viewers come back or when


---------21:09----------
it arises again I feel like I deserve it


---------21:12----------
you know I deserve their their eyes and


---------21:14----------
her presence does look good


---------21:15----------
I worked there you know I didn't just so


---------21:18----------
you know so Felix why do you have to


---------21:21----------
shave off viewers this is important why


---------21:26----------
do you settle that's like this is real


---------21:28----------
sabotage why do you have to get rid of


---------21:31----------
them um what how do you feel if they


---------21:37----------
stayed and you play like [ __ ]


---------21:41----------
well I think I'm most the time yeah


---------21:47----------
right how does that feel to you to waste


---------21:49----------
other people's time it feels really


---------21:51----------
better and how does it feel when they


---------21:54----------
leave um


---------21:58----------
I think you'll feel good I'm gonna do it


---------22:00----------
it feels weird but somewhat good yep but


---------22:04----------
I give me a bit any gives me a goal yeah


---------22:06----------
so that's weird right look let's just


---------22:08----------
look at that for a second mm-hmm okay


---------22:13----------
let's look at that okay so when you play


---------22:16----------
bad and people stick around look why do


---------22:20----------
you think they stick around because you


---------22:23----------
have to push them out the door right you


---------22:25----------
have to actively try to get them to like


---------22:27----------
leave why do they stick around I mean


---------22:31----------
the people that sit around I mean for


---------22:34----------
for game play I would that would think


---------22:36----------
that they would stay because of how good


---------22:38----------
they think I am or how better the thing


---------22:41----------
I can do no no no they stay because they


---------22:50----------
they like you they value you okay okay


---------22:57----------
that's good


---------22:59----------
but when I when I give up performance


---------23:01----------
and gameplay that I don't like I


---------23:05----------
understand you don't like that okay


---------23:08----------
right so you think your value is


---------23:11----------
determined by your gameplay so yeah but


---------23:16----------
well what I'm telling I mean they're got


---------23:18----------
they have to be people I mean I don't


---------23:19----------
really know but there have to be people


---------23:22----------
who are better at overwatch than you are


---------23:25----------
right yeah yeah how do they watch you


---------23:28----------
like this is the thing that you don't


---------23:30----------
get and it's so [ __ ] confusing to you


---------23:32----------
that you have value outside of your


---------23:34----------
performance because the other guys


---------23:37----------
didn't scream fine whatever you can


---------23:40----------
devalue yourself however but do you get


---------23:42----------
that like they're sticky because they


---------23:43----------
like you okay and then and then what do


---------23:47----------
you do like that feels weird like if I


---------23:49----------
tell you if I tell you the things that


---------23:50----------
people like you because of you and not


---------23:54----------
because you're playing perfect every


---------23:56----------
match how does that make you feel must


---------24:00----------
feel a bit weird yeah what is that weird


---------24:02----------
let's understand that


---------24:10----------
don't think that I'm like interesting


---------24:12----------
enough for that like a level of


---------24:14----------
attention or something yep right so so


---------24:19----------
there's a disconnect between the way


---------24:21----------
that you value yourself as a person and


---------24:23----------
the way that twitch values you and this


---------24:25----------
is why twitch is beautiful because they


---------24:28----------
care about you as a person and that's


---------24:30----------
[ __ ] confusing to you and then what


---------24:34----------
you do is you have to repeat this drama


---------24:36----------
right or that's what you do is you push


---------24:37----------
them out the door


---------24:38----------
so like let me just let me think about


---------24:41----------
this I have to just write this out okay


---------24:43----------
mmm-hmm I'm gonna need a minute okay


---------24:51----------
now that I can listen and and and and


---------24:54----------
type this in time


---------24:56----------
probably not but let me hear what you


---------24:57----------
good no no go for it not no it was I was


---------25:00----------
adding some precision please um now this


---------25:04----------
guy like develop into something


---------25:05----------
different now that it's not exactly like


---------25:07----------
that anymore because I'm not really like


---------25:10----------
a competitor anymore so if I if I if I


---------25:12----------
play like trash it's like whatever


---------25:15----------
I don't really hold my own game look


---------25:17----------
they're like a high standard I only care


---------25:19----------
when I care or I only care but the


---------25:23----------
gameplay or my performance when I want


---------25:26----------
to care about it doesn't I sense okay if


---------25:28----------
I'm gonna stay well I'd what I don't


---------25:30----------
chaired that much if I played poorly oh


---------25:32----------
I can laugh it off and chitchat whatever


---------25:36----------
but I'm gonna stay where I Duke about


---------25:38----------
the gameplay and I want to show them


---------25:40----------
that I'm good to myself and others


---------25:42----------
and sure that that passion for getting


---------25:45----------
better if I don't do well then I then I


---------25:48----------
get like that right okay so and I think


---------25:51----------
you've learned two modes is what I'm


---------25:53----------
here yeah yeah okay so we'll we'll dig


---------25:57----------
into that further that's very helpful


---------25:58----------
thank you for sharing that


---------25:59----------
okay


---------26:06----------
okay so this is what I'm gonna say okay


---------26:08----------
so I there's this idea of intrinsic


---------26:10----------
value which is value about like who you


---------26:13----------
are and then there's extrinsic value


---------26:16----------
there's like the value that the world


---------26:18----------
shows you okay and and so somewhere


---------26:23----------
along the way you started like needing


---------26:25----------
that at like you felt like you don't


---------26:27----------
have intrinsic value like your sense of


---------26:30----------
like what you bring to the table is


---------26:32----------
dependent on your performance so this is


---------26:37----------
like like you know so I'm a doctor so


---------26:39----------
it's kind of like a doctor saying you


---------26:40----------
know whether I'm a good doctor or bad


---------26:42----------
doctor sort of depends on how many lives


---------26:44----------
I save or don't save which makes sense


---------26:46----------
right like if I'm I mean if you think


---------26:49----------
about it like a good doctor is someone


---------26:50----------
who saves a lot of lives but it's subtle


---------26:53----------
makes sense I'm not saying it's


---------26:55----------
illogical at all yes and I think there's


---------26:57----------
something weird that happens so when you


---------26:58----------
play so when you rise and you have a


---------27:01----------
certain level of value and then you play


---------27:03----------
poorly and twitch hat doesn't leave you


---------27:07----------
something funny happens you feel


---------27:09----------
uncomfortable yeah because they are not


---------27:12----------
sending you signals that are consistent


---------27:15----------
with the way that you you see yourself


---------27:17----------
you're like why are these why are these


---------27:19----------
[ __ ] people watching this show they


---------27:20----------
don't know they don't like this is


---------27:22----------
shitty like I'm performing terribly and


---------27:25----------
then what you have to do is you have to


---------27:26----------
create the reality that you feel which


---------27:29----------
is that you have to since they're like


---------27:31----------
so imagine you're on stage and there are


---------27:32----------
a lot of people watching and you're


---------27:34----------
bombing on stage right like you're doing


---------27:36----------
a terrible job but like no one's leaving


---------27:38----------
the theater and then what happens is


---------27:40----------
like put them yes put the big amount of


---------27:42----------
it I just blow in the mic yep no and and


---------27:47----------
then you take like it you go backstage


---------27:49----------
and you take a sack of like rotten fruit


---------27:51----------
and then you start throwing at people


---------27:52----------
yeah and then and then they start


---------27:55----------
leaving and then you feel good about


---------27:58----------
yourself because at least then they are


---------28:00----------
doing what they're supposed to do it's


---------28:03----------
exactly they're supposed to leave


---------28:06----------
because I'm shitty like why aren't they


---------28:07----------
leaving and then what you do then it's a


---------28:12----------
system you understand right because then


---------28:13----------
everyone has left and then there's one


---------28:16----------
dude in the theatre and then you're like


---------28:17----------
okay I can


---------28:18----------
I'm back and then Feliz arises from the


---------28:21----------
atrás you pick up the microphone you


---------28:23----------
start making jokes you start performing


---------28:24----------
again and then people start coming back


---------28:26----------
and you're like okay okay this is okay


---------28:27----------
this is okay because then you know what


---------28:30----------
you're what you're offering them is good


---------28:32----------
because they're coming in the door yeah


---------28:36----------
right yeah it's so like let's just think


---------28:40----------
about that like what do you think about


---------28:42----------
that man um I think it's a route to


---------28:51----------
failure but it's also a road success


---------28:53----------
absolutely so success and failure is one


---------28:57----------
thing okay we're not talking about


---------28:59----------
success in failure


---------29:00----------
I mean we can but what I'm talking about


---------29:03----------
is value I'm not talking about the


---------29:05----------
external world what I'm saying the weird


---------29:07----------
thing here is that when you're on stage


---------29:10----------
and you feel like you're bombing those


---------29:13----------
people want to stay yeah what do you


---------29:17----------
think about that it it's it's almost


---------29:25----------
discomforting it's it's odd it's very


---------29:27----------
discomforting what is that discomfort


---------29:28----------
what are you feeling like I said I think


---------29:36----------
I'm I'm telling them like I'm wasting


---------29:38----------
their time I feel like I've gotta sign


---------29:42----------
for something and they're not getting it


---------29:45----------
and you're sticking around to like the


---------29:46----------
potential Idid love it it will happen


---------29:48----------
yeah so sure I understand like because


---------29:52----------
because once again if you think they're


---------29:54----------
sticking around for the potential it


---------29:55----------
could happen but that's because you


---------29:57----------
believe they're sticking around because


---------29:58----------
of your performance right like it's like


---------30:03----------
you think that your value is based on


---------30:05----------
your performance which makes a lot of


---------30:06----------
sense because your life has been one


---------30:09----------
where I imagine I mean I think you're


---------30:11----------
pretty good at overwatch right yeah I'm


---------30:14----------
somebody yeah so if you're really good


---------30:16----------
at overwatch then you've been taught


---------30:18----------
that your success is correlated with


---------30:21----------
your performance


---------30:22----------
absolutely and but here's the thing


---------30:25----------
right like so here's the funny thing


---------30:26----------
about twitch is that there are a lot of


---------30:27----------
people here who are very very good and


---------30:29----------
and also like but I don't think that


---------30:32----------
that's that it's not just skill that


---------30:35----------
makes you good I mean successful on


---------30:39----------
twitch right there's something there's


---------30:41----------
something that streamers have which


---------30:43----------
connect with like this is the really


---------30:45----------
cool thing for as a psychiatrist I see


---------30:47----------
this it's like really fascinating if


---------30:49----------
there's something about you there's


---------30:50----------
something intrinsic about who you are


---------30:53----------
that like resonates with people in your


---------30:55----------
audience like they connect to you in


---------30:58----------
some way and that's not just because


---------30:59----------
you're good because they're all like


---------31:01----------
what if you just think about it you know


---------31:02----------
there are lots of good overwatch players


---------31:04----------
out there and maybe some of them scream


---------31:06----------
maybe some of them don't but there are a


---------31:08----------
lot of good people who stream but I


---------31:11----------
think the crazy thing here is somewhere


---------31:13----------
along the way you lost like you can't


---------31:15----------
fathom that someone would stay on the


---------31:18----------
stage if you're playing back I mean


---------31:19----------
someone would stay in the audience and


---------31:21----------
say in their seats if you're playing bad


---------31:23----------
on stage and I think that if you want to


---------31:26----------
stop self sabotaging like first of all


---------31:28----------
like because that's what you're doing


---------31:29----------
right when you when you start going and


---------31:31----------
you just you know you push them out and


---------31:36----------
then the problem is that it reinforces


---------31:38----------
even though it shouldn't because like it


---------31:41----------
reinforces this idea that your value


---------31:43----------
comes from bringing people in the door


---------31:46----------
but the real thing is if you really look


---------31:48----------
at it scientifically clearly that's not


---------31:50----------
where your value comes from because when


---------31:51----------
you play bad people don't leave but


---------31:54----------
you're just ignoring that data point


---------31:57----------
yeah because


---------31:59----------
I feel like in that mystery moment like


---------32:02----------
I care about being good I care about


---------32:04----------
being a competitor I care about


---------32:06----------
outperforming I care about like rolling


---------32:08----------
in my game like in that state of mind


---------32:11----------
like I don't it seems kind of like an


---------32:15----------
odd to say I don't care that much about


---------32:16----------
about twitch I don't care that much


---------32:18----------
about about your numbers I care about


---------32:20----------
being good yes so I think that makes


---------32:22----------
perfect sense but then the question is


---------32:24----------
there's a part of you so I think that's


---------32:26----------
exactly what you should care about right


---------32:28----------
like you should care about going on


---------32:30----------
stage and just giving the best of what


---------32:32----------
you can get the problem is that clearly


---------32:35----------
there is a part of your mind that cares


---------32:37----------
about more than that okay because if


---------32:40----------
that's all you cared about like let's


---------32:41----------
say you're on stage and you're juggling


---------32:43----------
and you drop a ball or something right


---------32:45----------
if all you care about is being better


---------32:47----------
you're just gonna pick up the ball and


---------32:49----------
keep juggling and whether people say or


---------32:51----------
people go you don't care because you're


---------32:52----------
focused on the juggling in fact I think


---------32:55----------
that there is something in you that


---------32:56----------
isn't it can because but that's not what


---------32:58----------
happens is you put it you shave off


---------33:01----------
yours so clearly there's a part of you


---------33:03----------
that cares about something else there's


---------33:06----------
a part of you that cares about being a


---------33:08----------
good juggler and there's a part of you


---------33:10----------
that cares about being seen is a good


---------33:13----------
juggler you don't want people to see


---------33:16----------
your failure that's that's accurate


---------33:20----------
that's good that's true that that was a


---------33:25----------
good mental development I didn't think


---------33:28----------
about anything about the way I always


---------33:30----------
see it like I said one sided thing yeah


---------33:32----------
right and that's not wrong because I


---------33:35----------
think you're you're a smart guy Felix


---------33:36----------
and you know that part of yourself but


---------33:39----------
if we look at your behavior there's


---------33:40----------
something else it's not that you're


---------33:42----------
wrong it's that it's incomplete and now


---------33:45----------
we get to the idea of like when did you


---------33:47----------
so now I want to thoughts questions can


---------33:50----------
I keep going no that's all good


---------33:52----------
so so so let's think about this when did


---------33:55----------
you start caring about because you're


---------33:57----------
not a guy who usually cares about


---------33:58----------
appearances right no really


---------34:01----------
so when can you remember a time where


---------34:04----------
that changed when did you start caring


---------34:07----------
like this could it could be like a small


---------34:08----------
and insignificant thing like maybe you


---------34:11----------
were growing up or something like that


---------34:12----------
oh well say never appearances I don't I


---------34:23----------
certainly I cared that much appearances


---------34:26----------
as in what because I was always like I


---------34:30----------
don't know go ahead


---------34:32----------
like was there a time that you remember


---------34:34----------
kind of feeling but not necessarily


---------34:38----------
physical appearances but that like you


---------34:40----------
kind of feel I mean this is such a


---------34:41----------
generic question everyone's gonna have


---------34:43----------
this but you know we're a time where you


---------34:45----------
kind of felt like super ashamed of the


---------34:47----------
way that you were perceived that you


---------34:50----------
felt like other people saw you as a


---------34:52----------
failure


---------34:55----------
mmm I look back at it I mean that's


---------35:02----------
gonna be true of everyone my question is


---------35:04----------
does anything jump to your mind so let


---------35:06----------
me put it this way so you know when when


---------35:10----------
you're when you're playing poorly and


---------35:13----------
people are sticking around and you feel


---------35:15----------
discomfort can you remember feeling that


---------35:19----------
discomfort in other scenarios outside of


---------35:22----------
streaming and gaming yeah there was this


---------35:27----------
where people should be leaving and they


---------35:30----------
should be calling you a piece of [ __ ]


---------35:31----------
but they didn't and I had this um had


---------35:35----------
this thing a long time ago where I had


---------35:42----------
to I would I was good at doing


---------35:44----------
trampoline right and the people at my


---------35:48----------
gym saw it and they wanted me to compete


---------35:50----------
right mm-hmm because I could do tricks


---------35:53----------
that other people couldn't so I started


---------35:56----------
training and refining the moves whatever


---------35:59----------
and then I had to compete in like some


---------36:02----------
some weird suit I didn't like any of it


---------36:03----------
I didn't like it the weirdness of


---------36:06----------
competing I like more the organic action


---------36:11----------
of it yeah so the present that I'm just


---------36:15----------
doing the trick for the sake of doing


---------36:16----------
the trick right not trying to win yeah


---------36:18----------
exactly yeah or make it perfect make it


---------36:20----------
look perfect whatever like that that


---------36:21----------
profession of the craft wasn't really oh


---------36:23----------
now it's a like ninja


---------36:25----------
line unbelievable where my my dad won on


---------36:32----------
like a date and I this competition or


---------36:36----------
whatever and you were like oh you know


---------36:39----------
we're gonna go watch you I was like dude


---------36:41----------
hell yeah man I'm gonna I'm gonna roll


---------36:43----------
you know cuz I'm better than all these


---------36:44----------
kids so I show up there and my moves are


---------36:47----------
like way better


---------36:48----------
I'm objectively if I just do whatever


---------36:52----------
I'm doing all the time my normal like


---------36:54----------
routine I I witness and I show up and I


---------36:59----------
bombed super harder but first Rick lens


---------37:03----------
I onto the side and then I jump sideways


---------37:06----------
like Ivan fall and then the second


---------37:11----------
attempt rolls around and it's even worse


---------37:12----------
right


---------37:13----------
and it's like everybody didn't say just


---------37:16----------
quiet right or like I stop with it's


---------37:18----------
over or like when she thought it's over


---------37:19----------
and it's just completely quiet anybody's


---------37:22----------
looking I'm like oh my god like I I


---------37:25----------
can't believe and my dad's on a date


---------37:26----------
right and I know he's out there and I'm


---------37:28----------
like this is unbelievable and that was


---------37:32----------
like really really bad and I ended up


---------37:34----------
quitting I'm done with competing like


---------37:36----------
I'm just never gonna fit again yeah that


---------37:41----------
was one of those moments


---------37:44----------
and what did your dad say um he always


---------37:51----------
like pushing to compete and everything


---------37:53----------
so a lot of times like you know in in in


---------37:58----------
other scenarios when I was young about


---------37:59----------
more than I would compete you'd be like


---------38:03----------
you know it's okay man good job good job


---------38:05----------
but that was so embarrassing that it was


---------38:07----------
kind of like it's a scam and like you


---------38:09----------
know there it is hold on a second


---------38:12----------
so when you perform badly and he says


---------38:15----------
good job that's people not leaving the


---------38:18----------
audience yeah great so when your dad


---------38:22----------
would say good job I want you to think


---------38:24----------
back and really remember how did you


---------38:25----------
feel when he said good job after you


---------38:27----------
know you did a bad job that's very


---------38:32----------
important for me what in what way when


---------38:36----------
you [ __ ] up and your dad said good job


---------38:41----------
then he saw the value in me trying it


---------38:48----------
matters that um you know I I fell once


---------38:54----------
and used to buy me and I'll have to fall


---------38:57----------
again so sense like almost like failing


---------39:02----------
twice else so you felt very supported by


---------39:07----------
him yeah by saying you did a good job


---------39:11----------
yeah did you feel ashamed um kinda like


---------39:17----------
on the fence you got like a in the gray


---------39:19----------
area where you like you failed once and


---------39:22----------
you feel like if if you have feedback


---------39:25----------
that you failed them then you failed


---------39:27----------
twice right so being like in on edge


---------39:32----------
about like how much of a failure this is


---------39:35----------
and then singing like support you and


---------39:37----------
they go good job can I make sure okay


---------39:41----------
you know it's not it's not that bad yeah


---------39:45----------
so I'm actually so that's interesting


---------39:47----------
that wasn't the answer I was expecting


---------39:48----------
from that story but well let's let me


---------39:52----------
just think for okay so the interesting


---------39:54----------
thing is that so it sounds like he was


---------39:56----------
supportive but it also


---------39:57----------
sounds like it doubles the pressure on


---------39:59----------
you yeah to win the second time yeah and


---------40:05----------
the interesting thing is that in a weird


---------40:08----------
way that actually sounds like winning


---------40:10----------
people back right so like let me just


---------40:13----------
let me just give you man this is so hard


---------40:16----------
to wrap my head around but I'm gonna try


---------40:18----------
to say it and it may not make sense so


---------40:21----------
so I'm just trying to think about okay


---------40:23----------
like when you it's like it's almost like


---------40:26----------
your dad giving you feedback and then


---------40:29----------
you winning after that is like you


---------40:32----------
getting your rank back after losing rank


---------40:35----------
yeah does that make sense


---------40:39----------
yeah or getting at least a part of it


---------40:41----------
that getting a part of it back right


---------40:43----------
it's like it's not that fail like you


---------40:44----------
have no problem dropping ranks what


---------40:47----------
bothers you is like dropping a rank and


---------40:50----------
not getting it back yeah but also losing


---------40:54----------
even more because of my projected rank


---------40:56----------
in his mind or something yeah that's


---------40:59----------
exactly what we need to talk about okay


---------41:01----------
right so where do you get the idea of


---------41:04----------
like what his projected like I mean I


---------41:06----------
hate to be so [ __ ] generic isn't it


---------41:08----------
you know use the psychiatry term but


---------41:10----------
like it is your dad proud of you um yeah


---------41:19----------
maybe I don't know in what times though


---------41:25----------
like when he what


---------41:28----------
proud proud I can tell when he when he


---------41:31----------
when he's proud to be nice I can also


---------41:35----------
tell right and I feel like like as you


---------41:39----------
kind of grow older I feel like yeah I


---------41:43----------
don't know I know how to put this I feel


---------41:47----------
like when I was young I needed him more


---------41:52----------
to be proud than today I thought now I


---------41:56----------
feel like more more like places where I


---------41:59----------
get like validation or that more like


---------42:03----------
why I get way did you do it can you tell


---------42:07----------
me what I just need a second I'm sorry


---------42:10----------
keep going


---------42:11----------
uh-oh I'm saying wrong or like uh


---------42:13----------
something over I don't know no I think


---------42:15----------
it's I think it's like exactly what


---------42:17----------
we're looking for it's just it's taken


---------42:19----------
aback by your answer right because what


---------42:22----------
I'm hearing from you is sometimes that's


---------42:26----------
what I'm hearing but there's well yeah


---------42:31----------
there's a lot there because I mean you


---------42:33----------
just said that you needed like the time


---------42:35----------
that you needed him to be proud of you


---------42:37----------
was when you were younger which is also


---------42:41----------
like that implies that he wasn't yeah


---------42:44----------
that's a powerful statement to make and


---------42:47----------
then the last thing is that like you


---------42:50----------
know generally speaking like as a parent


---------42:53----------
you know I mean a complicated answer to


---------42:57----------
the question is your dad proud of you is


---------42:59----------
sort of like a no right so that means


---------43:02----------
that on some level like it's complicated


---------43:04----------
in your mind it's still muddy it hasn't


---------43:06----------
been resolved and it's certainly not a


---------43:07----------
yes yeah and if we think a little bit


---------43:11----------
about it I mean I think that that's like


---------43:13----------
that's what we have to look into I mean


---------43:15----------
I feel like okay so let's just take a


---------43:18----------
step back and let me walk you through my


---------43:19----------
reasoning okay sure so we talked about


---------43:22----------
imposter syndrome we talked about


---------43:24----------
self-sabotage we talked about not living


---------43:27----------
up to expectations there's this idea


---------43:29----------
that like you let people down and make


---------43:31----------
their capacity to have intrinsic pride


---------43:34----------
and you is a person when they do that it


---------43:38----------
confuses the [ __ ] out and then what you


---------43:41----------
do is you create a


---------43:42----------
situation where they're proud of you but


---------43:45----------
their pride in you makes sense because


---------43:48----------
you are proud in yourself as well yeah


---------43:51----------
the problem arises when you feel ashamed


---------43:54----------
of yourself and they don't connect with


---------43:57----------
you there they're like not calling you a


---------43:59----------
piece of [ __ ] when they should be


---------44:00----------
calling you a piece of [ __ ] but instead


---------44:02----------
what they do is they send you love and


---------44:03----------
support and that's just really odd and


---------44:05----------
confusing to you so then you change the


---------44:07----------
system up to where you feel comfortable


---------44:09----------
with in it and the way that you feel


---------44:12----------
comfortable is by winning again like


---------44:15----------
what makes you uncomfortable is when


---------44:17----------
people care about you and you're losing


---------44:19----------
so you just like you're like okay I'm


---------44:21----------
gonna lose and then I'm gonna push them


---------44:22----------
out the door and then I'm gonna win and


---------44:23----------
then they've loved you all along the


---------44:26----------
only difference is that like sometimes


---------44:28----------
you love yourself and you create systems


---------44:31----------
where you can love yourself and then


---------44:32----------
their love for you which is constant


---------44:34----------
makes more [ __ ] sense does that make


---------44:38----------
sense


---------44:38----------
mm-hmm the next question becomes where


---------44:41----------
the [ __ ] does this come from


---------44:42----------
like what like why is it so damn


---------44:44----------
complicated right why can't you just be


---------44:48----------
loved by twitch at like that's kind of


---------44:50----------
the end of it yeah and and one that it's


---------44:54----------
so then like usually that's learned okay


---------44:57----------
so it's not like you're busted in some


---------44:59----------
way it's just like like we learned that


---------45:01----------
right and so then the issue is I mean


---------45:03----------
then the issue is like you know who in


---------45:05----------
your life taught you that you don't have


---------45:09----------
intrinsic value because kids start out


---------45:12----------
kind of like narcissistic and


---------45:13----------
egotistical and they think they're the


---------45:14----------
wonderful most wonderful people in the


---------45:16----------
world and then someone comes along and


---------45:18----------
sort of tells them that you know your


---------45:20----------
value too so like you were taught


---------45:22----------
something which is that your value as a


---------45:23----------
human being depends on performance yeah


---------45:27----------
yeah sure I was there on whatever set


---------45:29----------
yeah so who taught you that my dad


---------45:32----------
taught me that okay okay


---------45:35----------
right so there we go right so so I don't


---------45:40----------
even that was too easy


---------45:42----------
hold on oh yeah I mean I can pinpoint it


---------45:45----------
it's not like it's like a logical tell


---------45:47----------
me tell me tell me about that just tell


---------45:50----------
me about your dad


---------45:51----------
you know teaching you that lesson I mean


---------45:54----------
that was


---------45:55----------
you always want me to compete and I was


---------45:58----------
looking better I was Lilly's a very


---------45:59----------
competitive when I was young with my


---------46:00----------
with my brother or like I kinda knew


---------46:03----------
that fire and he wanted me to compete in


---------46:07----------
things that I didn't really care about


---------46:08----------
but since you know when we were young


---------46:11----------
like I don't really have like passions


---------46:12----------
for like a crazy amount of things so if


---------46:14----------
you if you wants that oh maybe it's cool


---------46:16----------
just do it right I did it it's not like


---------46:18----------
he forced me to I mean if he did that it


---------46:22----------
wouldn't be much of his defense for me


---------46:23----------
so let's let's think for a second if you


---------46:26----------
didn't like it and he wanted you to


---------46:29----------
compete why did you do it if he didn't


---------46:31----------
force you Oh we'll take your animals


---------46:34----------
learn like like skiing I used to do like


---------46:35----------
competitive skiing right and I didn't


---------46:41----------
even like it that much


---------46:42----------
III thought was gonna boring the way you


---------46:45----------
look like this and I thought was trash


---------46:48----------
but he cared about a lot and all his


---------46:51----------
friends like all had kids that that


---------46:52----------
would that would compete and I just kind


---------46:54----------
of had to show up and I would roll them


---------46:58----------
but I didn't really care about it why


---------47:02----------
did you do it


---------47:05----------
um because about that long meet you so


---------47:09----------
what were you looking for when you roll


---------47:11----------
them what would your dad how would you


---------47:13----------
look at you what would he say I mean


---------47:15----------
he'd be super proud when I would win and


---------47:17----------
I would I know I read a lot so to be


---------47:19----------
proud all the time right


---------47:22----------
and how did that make you feel I'm gonna


---------47:25----------
feel good like I'm when I on both ends


---------47:29----------
whatare to ends well


---------47:34----------
when add at the computing so I get like


---------47:37----------
the Val vision like oh you're ranked 1


---------47:39----------
or whatever and then did you care about


---------47:42----------
that yeah of course


---------47:45----------
ok even if I don't care about what it is


---------47:48----------
if I win it still matters ok sometimes


---------47:52----------
even more than what the action is itself


---------47:54----------
ok


---------47:56----------
right sure but like if that doesn't mean


---------47:59----------
nobody cares about like like Dora and


---------48:01----------
like the rank 1 speedrunner it's still


---------48:03----------
still feels good


---------48:04----------
sure I'm reg Warren okay and what was


---------48:08----------
winning on the other side he said


---------48:09----------
actually winning isn't I mean it and


---------48:11----------
then and then he he's proud of me then


---------48:14----------
III since he he's like a like a


---------48:18----------
competent mind sets like I know that he


---------48:20----------
cares that I win so I win and for myself


---------48:24----------
and I went for him too


---------48:24----------
that's gonna double win hmm both ends


---------48:29----------
yeah so what I'm hearing didn't did your


---------48:33----------
dad how would he treat you if you lost


---------48:39----------
um I guess it depends in what field but


---------48:42----------
I guess he still he still feel pretty


---------48:46----------
good I suppose yeah I I I think I think


---------48:54----------
you still gave me that validation even


---------48:55----------
when I didn't do well and did you know


---------48:59----------
he was do you think he was being genuine


---------49:01----------
at those times or you think he was


---------49:02----------
disappointed in you I think so


---------49:05----------
no I don't I don't I really feel like


---------49:08----------
you feel disappointed in my competing he


---------49:11----------
did or did not did not I don't think he


---------49:13----------
I don't think he ever felt like that and


---------49:17----------
have that it's not even like that like


---------49:18----------
it it just happened a lot like um like


---------49:23----------
competing like for myself but for him


---------49:25----------
also like if there's a bunch of times I


---------49:27----------
competed in like a skiing biking some


---------49:32----------
some other [ __ ] like like it would


---------49:35----------
happen by commonly you know how old were


---------49:37----------
you when you were competing and skiing


---------49:39----------
and biking I guess I'd be like 10 and


---------49:44----------
then maybe like 13 12 and in that


---------49:49----------
sounded like you didn't really like


---------49:50----------
those sports right no I didn't like him


---------49:53----------
that much especially especially biking


---------49:55----------
because my bike sucked it was just trash


---------49:58----------
right ask vegans kids dad like like


---------50:01----------
multi-thousand dollar bikes or whatever


---------50:03----------
and then that's like a long story but my


---------50:06----------
chain like I could be close to winning


---------50:08----------
and it might change elevate would would


---------50:11----------
fall off and had to physically get up


---------50:14----------
and and put it back on both on both ends


---------50:17----------
right and then go back again and I just


---------50:21----------
felt cheated all the time when I lost I


---------50:23----------
got at the end and I lost like did I


---------50:25----------
didn't have a chance he oh this this


---------50:27----------
[ __ ] sucks like [ __ ] these guys you


---------50:29----------
guys you guys are balls you're not even


---------50:30----------
good at the sport man she might I can't


---------50:32----------
give me a get a working by deal yeah


---------50:34----------
yeah and what happened at the end of the


---------50:38----------
race what did your dad say


---------50:43----------
crowd but I I would never like hold it


---------50:46----------
against them like they don't have a good


---------50:47----------
but I couldn't airily I mean like that


---------50:51----------
for me there was no other tool that I


---------50:53----------
could have like that was my tool and it


---------50:55----------
was trash you know just make it work


---------50:57----------
right yeah but he was proud anyway like


---------51:00----------
you'd still I give me that that that


---------51:01----------
validation of like and then he still it


---------51:05----------
is it a pretty good like I'm like I'm


---------51:08----------
glad you did it or something or


---------51:10----------
yeah champion is your dad proud of you


---------51:14----------
odd I don't throw the ball on stream but


---------51:19----------
yeah I don't think so yeah I don't think


---------51:21----------
so either


---------51:23----------
so the notion is why why do you feel


---------51:27----------
that way I think because he he has


---------51:31----------
things that he wants me to do well in


---------51:32----------
and and those things I don't do well or


---------51:38----------
never cared enough to do well and he is


---------51:41----------
sort of interested it doesn't shift just


---------51:44----------
guys stayed there how does that make you


---------51:45----------
feel


---------51:50----------
it makes me see that values and vision


---------51:54----------
elsewhere and find and build systems


---------51:56----------
where I get it there did you understand


---------52:00----------
that before this conversation not really


---------52:03----------
okay because that's absolutely the


---------52:06----------
answer very well said


---------52:08----------
okay right so like the fuel for your


---------52:12----------
system brilliant actually Felix could


---------52:15----------
that's the point that I'm moving towards


---------52:18----------
but that only is true if your dad is not


---------52:20----------
proud right and like that's where like


---------52:22----------
it's a hard thing like how do you feel


---------52:24----------
saying the words out loud that you're


---------52:26----------
afraid that your dad may not be proud of


---------52:28----------
you because I'm not sorry that he's not


---------52:29----------
proud of you for the record but like how


---------52:33----------
does it feel to say that I feels kind of


---------52:36----------
odd because I feel like um your parents


---------52:38----------
are kind of like a big part like you


---------52:40----------
know you got this big puzzle whatever


---------52:42----------
and you know it has like a thousand


---------52:43----------
pieces


---------52:44----------
or all the pieces that are like you're


---------52:46----------
your parents are like that like huge


---------52:48----------
ones in the middle that the ones that


---------52:49----------
you should care about the ones that are


---------52:52----------
that matter the most step right yeah but


---------52:55----------
like what makes you think you don't


---------52:56----------
matter about but what will you care do


---------52:59----------
you don't care about them or they don't


---------53:00----------
matter how are you getting that boy so I


---------53:02----------
said that again so you just said those


---------53:04----------
are the puzzle pieces that should matter


---------53:06----------
the most


---------53:07----------
yeah when you say should matter the most


---------53:09----------
it implies that they don't matter the


---------53:11----------
most so why do you think that your


---------53:13----------
parents don't matter well now they


---------53:17----------
matter but now the since I've build


---------53:20----------
those systems they're their input and


---------53:23----------
division is kind of irrelevant yes and


---------53:29----------
absolutely not so you're you're a


---------53:31----------
hundred percent correct that you have


---------53:33----------
created systems that will satisfy the


---------53:37----------
hunger that your parents left you with


---------53:40----------
mm-hmm but the goal here at least in my


---------53:45----------
mind is to like is to be free of those


---------53:48----------
systems because those systems [ __ ]


---------53:50----------
torture you okay right so like there's a


---------53:55----------
part there's a there's a there's a world


---------53:56----------
I want you to imagine Felix where you


---------53:59----------
play because you want to be the best not


---------54:02----------
because you need validation and I know


---------54:04----------
you know


---------54:05----------
but you play for the purpose of


---------54:07----------
schooling those noobs but yeah that's


---------54:10----------
enough but then what you have is this


---------54:13----------
whole other layer on it where like you


---------54:15----------
need the validation like it's not about


---------54:17----------
like cuz this goes back to like you know


---------54:19----------
you there's a moment where you want to


---------54:20----------
juggle just for the sake of juggling but


---------54:22----------
you do care so my whole point is that if


---------54:24----------
you want to live the life that you


---------54:26----------
really want to live which is to focus on


---------54:27----------
juggling in schooling news for the sake


---------54:29----------
of schooling news you've got to let go


---------54:31----------
of caring about other people and I know


---------54:34----------
that you do that like 90% of the time


---------54:36----------
and they're like 10 percent of the time


---------54:38----------
this weird [ __ ] happens in your mind


---------54:39----------
you're not even sure what's happening


---------54:41----------
and you're looking for validation and


---------54:42----------
then you use these phrases


---------54:44----------
you know you're discouraged impostor


---------54:46----------
syndrome self-sabotage like that's not a


---------54:48----------
life that you need to be living man it's


---------54:50----------
not a life I want you to live I want you


---------54:53----------
to all the life yeah go ahead


---------54:54----------
okay I want that life to like whatever


---------54:57----------
you're gonna say like I would probably


---------54:59----------
hundred say it would by omegan lessons


---------55:00----------
cuz your logical and but at the same


---------55:03----------
time sometimes I convinced myself of


---------55:08----------
like bad mental loops whatever and I'm


---------55:12----------
like hey man this thing is maybe not


---------55:16----------
like a like I had like a healthy mindset


---------55:20----------
but it just kind of works I'm just gonna


---------55:23----------
destroying that some way if I lose that


---------55:25----------
and it's trash been away so this is a


---------55:28----------
conch problem okay so like there's this


---------55:32----------
idea that caring and I mean like I feel


---------55:35----------
like I'm talking to Pokemon so like like


---------55:37----------
if you watch the video from her she she


---------55:40----------
actually calls it a whip


---------55:41----------
so she whips herself and she's a friend


---------55:45----------
like to be the best and and she


---------55:47----------
optimizes a lot of stuff in in her like


---------55:49----------
she's always an optimizer and she always


---------55:51----------
strives to be the best and then she's


---------55:53----------
also really confused cuz all you guys


---------55:54----------
are confused and then like I work with a


---------55:56----------
lot of executives and things like that


---------55:57----------
all those guys are confused too how can


---------56:00----------
you continue to perform if you abandon


---------56:02----------
your current system and the answer is


---------56:04----------
you absolutely can it it's and and that


---------56:10----------
becomes that that's a conversation about


---------56:11----------
another Sun script concept called


---------56:13----------
Vairagya which means detachment and and


---------56:17----------
we can kind of go down there but I want


---------56:18----------
to kind of


---------56:19----------
this thing with your dad if that's okay


---------56:20----------
now go ahead so the short answer is that


---------56:24----------
you can be successful by not caring


---------56:27----------
about other people or even success


---------56:30----------
success comes from you picking up the


---------56:33----------
balls that you're juggling and trying to


---------56:35----------
do better than you did the last time it


---------56:37----------
has nothing to do with whether you think


---------56:39----------
you're a good person


---------56:40----------
has nothing to do whether other people


---------56:41----------
think you're a good person and that is


---------56:43----------
what success depends upon so you can


---------56:45----------
abandon the rest of all of your


---------56:47----------
psychological [ __ ] in your systems and


---------56:49----------
whatever and as long as every time you


---------56:51----------
pick up a ball I mean every time you


---------56:53----------
drop a ball you pick it up and you try


---------56:54----------
to do better the next time you're gonna


---------56:56----------
be successful what do you think about


---------56:58----------
that [ __ ] myself ins yeah so you don't


---------57:03----------
need any of the rest of this crap that I


---------57:05----------
know you're comforted in because those


---------57:07----------
are the systems that you've developed


---------57:08----------
for yourself and so you've come to rely


---------57:10----------
on those but you can let go of those and


---------57:13----------
as long as like because at the end of


---------57:15----------
the day you could care about what other


---------57:16----------
people think and not focus on becoming a


---------57:19----------
better juggler and then like you've seen


---------57:21----------
those streamers right the streamers that


---------57:23----------
just care about what other people think


---------57:25----------
and don't focus on it wouldn't in just


---------57:27----------
say build it a craft or whatever perfect


---------57:29----------
their craft like yeah it's perfection of


---------57:31----------
the craft that leads to success in life


---------57:33----------
its devotion to the thing that you are


---------57:35----------
doing that leads to success not anything


---------57:39----------
else anyway so we can talk about that


---------57:41----------
later but kind of coming back to your


---------57:43----------
your I mean I think we got a I mean I


---------57:47----------
think we got to figure out like you know


---------57:49----------
what's the deal with your dad and pride


---------57:51----------
like why don't you think your dad is


---------57:53----------
proud of you and there are good reasons


---------57:55----------
that you think that because he hasn't


---------57:57----------
conveyed that to you sufficiently I have


---------58:00----------
some hypotheses but well I'm mmm glide


---------58:03----------
and then because if I if he doesn't feel


---------58:05----------
it and that I want him to convey if he


---------58:07----------
doesn't feel like it if he doesn't feel


---------58:08----------
like he if he doesn't she's not proud of


---------58:10----------
me about something I want to give me the


---------58:13----------
design that they he is I feel like


---------58:15----------
that's misleading yeah I completely


---------58:17----------
agree but then the question is like why


---------58:19----------
isn't he practice


---------58:22----------
[Music]


---------58:25----------
ah I feel like he wants and wanted me to


---------58:32----------
perform and certain things that I didn't


---------58:33----------
perform in like like schooling like some


---------58:37----------
of the sport that he'd want me to do


---------58:38----------
like when I quit skiing I'm just no


---------58:41----------
boarding and I stopped competing I mean


---------58:43----------
I come in other ways like that's kinda


---------58:48----------
like how he wanted me to have success


---------58:49----------
even though I even even if I found


---------58:51----------
success in other ways it's still not in


---------58:54----------
his like model without he shies it and I


---------58:59----------
feel like not achieving that it's kind


---------59:00----------
of like it doesn't make him very proud


---------59:03----------
okay


---------59:08----------
things were like it yeah I like


---------59:10----------
schooling you always want me to do well


---------59:12----------
in school I can I can I could never care


---------59:14----------
okay um yeah alright two questions so


---------59:19----------
the first thing that I want to toss out


---------59:21----------
to use that I I think I wonder why he


---------59:24----------
cares so much about you being successful


---------59:25----------
is he's successful


---------59:32----------
prideful can you tell me about that um


---------59:40----------
well you know like


---------59:46----------
I feel like I like a brother and


---------59:51----------
yeah I I took mushroom for my dad and he


---------59:54----------
did like my brother doesn't mean yeah


---------59:56----------
like like an ego like a crazy over


---------59:58----------
competitive spirits like isn't there


---------60:01----------
like that prideful right isn't like as


---------60:06----------
like self-centered like I took like all


---------60:09----------
that from my dad how do you feel about


---------60:13----------
that taking all those things from your


---------60:16----------
dad


---------60:17----------
good and bad these are like double-edged


---------60:20----------
swords almost all of them it's right


---------60:22----------
answer


---------60:22----------
these things [ __ ] you over but these


---------60:24----------
things make you could sometimes also


---------60:26----------
sometimes I'm okay with like the


---------60:29----------
downsides these I also get the upside so


---------60:30----------
I am NOT I'm not that much allowed to be


---------60:33----------
upset about it by the way where is your


---------60:35----------
mom in AAPIs my mom's always there for


---------60:41----------
me in whatever I want but it's not as


---------60:46----------
[Music]


---------60:48----------
intense you tell me about your mom


---------60:53----------
well it's cool she's just not


---------60:56----------
in tents and things if she wants me to


---------60:59----------
do something she wants me to be good at


---------61:01----------
something


---------61:01----------
um if I fail her if I do her good


---------61:07----------
like any good or bad isn't intense hmm


---------61:13----------
and I was really raised with intensity


---------61:15----------
so is your mom proud of you yeah


---------61:22----------
so it's interesting right because like


---------61:24----------
when I asked you is your mom proud you


---------61:26----------
can say yes and I know you've sort of


---------61:29----------
said already that your dad is a you're


---------61:31----------
concerned that he may not be proud cuz


---------61:32----------
you didn't you didn't become the thing


---------61:34----------
that he wanted you to be hmm


---------61:36----------
right that's this we'll talk about that


---------61:38----------
in a second but I just I think it's


---------61:40----------
interesting how how complex your answer


---------61:42----------
is when it comes to your dad and how


---------61:43----------
simple your answer is when it comes to


---------61:45----------
your mom and and I wonder if there's a


---------61:48----------
parallel to be drawn between when you're


---------61:51----------
playing when you're when you're playing


---------61:52----------
poorly and people in the audience are


---------61:54----------
sticking around and they're not leaving


---------61:56----------
if that's your mom yeah and then I mean


---------62:02----------
but like I said it's it's I think for me


---------62:04----------
I think I'm trying like this is kind of


---------62:08----------
hard because it's very introspective


---------62:09----------
right yeah I try think of the root


---------62:11----------
causes my thoughts is that like I said


---------62:14----------
it's like I think it's really all about


---------62:16----------
the intensity it's like how how like May


---------62:23----------
disappointed or mad emmaandemma devil


---------62:25----------
get if I didn't perform in him well you


---------62:27----------
want me to do well in and I'm happy he


---------62:30----------
was and how proud that he was when I


---------62:32----------
would do well as with my mom even if she


---------62:35----------
was really proud of me maybe the way she


---------62:38----------
expressed that what even though she was


---------62:41----------
extremely excited wasn't as as deep or


---------62:45----------
as intense but it's kind of hard to


---------62:47----------
compete because my dad is extremely


---------62:49----------
intense so my mom was like above average


---------62:52----------
in terms of intensity my dad was like


---------62:54----------
way way way above average so she can


---------62:56----------
compete so what I'm hearing actually is


---------62:58----------
like I'm gonna toss something out called


---------63:00----------
contingent love so like it feels to me


---------63:04----------
like your dad's love was like contingent


---------63:07----------
like it depended on certain things


---------63:11----------
whereas your mom sounds like it wasn't


---------63:14----------
quite as dependent like it so maybe


---------63:16----------
another way to put it is that your dad's


---------63:17----------
love was conditional and your mom's love


---------63:19----------
was unconditional okay that's a bit of a


---------63:23----------
dark thought but yep it could make sense


---------63:27----------
yeah yeah I mean what's dark about that


---------63:31----------
that's a strong word it's all yeah


---------63:34----------
conditional that's a strong it's a


---------63:36----------
strong word how did how does it make you


---------63:39----------
feel to hear it


---------63:47----------
pants and throw them in the under the


---------63:48----------
bus and hold them to such labels fare so


---------63:52----------
let's talk about that for a second


---------63:54----------
mm-hmm so a lot of times I will use


---------64:00----------
strong words to amplify what is low in


---------64:06----------
the person I'm talking to for the record


---------64:09----------
I think it sounds like your parents are


---------64:11----------
amazing and wonderful people and I think


---------64:13----------
they've done it sounds like a good job


---------64:14----------
raising you I'm not hearing any kind of


---------64:16----------
abuse or any kind of [ __ ] like that I


---------64:18----------
think this is just how human beings work


---------64:21----------
like so I think my parents were


---------64:23----------
wonderful as well but I still had


---------64:25----------
hang-ups so can I tell you a story no no


---------64:28----------
so when I was let me just think about


---------64:34----------
where to start this story


---------64:38----------
so when I was finishing up my my


---------64:42----------
training in in Boston I had done a


---------64:45----------
really good job so I was like I


---------64:47----------
distinguish myself in some ways and and


---------64:50----------
was it a pretty competitive kind of


---------64:52----------
institution where there are a lot of


---------64:54----------
bright people and so I had kind of


---------64:56----------
distinguished myself and then I had a


---------64:58----------
mentor who had been supporting me for


---------65:00----------
like six years and started to become


---------65:04----------
kind of paranoid that like I'd created


---------65:06----------
this thing and I was like afraid that he


---------65:08----------
was gonna like take it over and I had


---------65:10----------
some reason to believe that but like I


---------65:12----------
kind of thought that this was something


---------65:13----------
that [ __ ] I don't want to go into the


---------65:16----------
story more um would like a precision I


---------65:19----------
kind of felt like I missed a part of the


---------65:21----------
story sure you were doing well better


---------65:26----------
than some of the bright people whatever


---------65:27----------
and then you and then what and then I


---------65:30----------
got paranoid that one of my mentors was


---------65:32----------
gonna take credit for my work


---------65:33----------
oh so what I had done is I created a


---------65:37----------
program so I'd created something called


---------65:39----------
a consult service where people with


---------65:40----------
mental health problems could come and


---------65:43----------
learn like meditation and use herbs and


---------65:45----------
and other kinds of like Eastern stuff to


---------65:48----------
help with their anxiety and their


---------65:50----------
depression and it was going very very


---------65:51----------
well because a lot of people are


---------65:52----------
interested in that and it works really


---------65:54----------
well and I was afraid that one of my


---------65:56----------
mentors would basically take over that


---------65:58----------
program which I had essentially built


---------65:59----------
from the ground up and it was really


---------66:02----------
weird because the guy had been nothing


---------66:03----------
but supportive and so I was doing some


---------66:06----------
kind of introspective work and actually


---------66:08----------
learning a particular kind of therapy at


---------66:10----------
that time and as part of learning that


---------66:12----------
therapy I had to do my own I would like


---------66:15----------
was kind of playing the role of the


---------66:16----------
patient so I was examining my own issues


---------66:19----------
and so we came up with this issue for me


---------66:21----------
to work on and what I realized that is


---------66:24----------
that like this fear that someone who has


---------66:26----------
been nothing but supportive is gonna


---------66:29----------
take away what I built actually comes


---------66:32----------
from my childhood and when I was 13


---------66:34----------
years old this is back before the


---------66:36----------
internet was a thing or even younger


---------66:37----------
there used to be these things called


---------66:39----------
bulletin board systems BBS's and back


---------66:43----------
before there was a centralized internet


---------66:45----------
what happened is you had a phone line


---------66:46----------
and you would connect to one other


---------66:49----------
computer through


---------66:51----------
a phone line and so what I did is a mic


---------66:53----------
my computer was a server that I hosted


---------66:56----------
games on and then like there would be


---------66:58----------
all these kids at school who would dial


---------67:01----------
into my computer and use my server to


---------67:04----------
take their turns in the game and then


---------67:06----------
like 30 kids would play like this


---------67:08----------
awesome game called barren realms elite


---------67:10----------
which is still an awesome game so it's


---------67:11----------
kind of like it's kind of like Clash of


---------67:13----------
Kings and stuff now it's sort of like


---------67:14----------
you take your turn every day you spend


---------67:16----------
resources you build armies you attack


---------67:18----------
other people and it's like compare like


---------67:19----------
you're like Travie I know whatever you


---------67:21----------
know that was that no yes whatever


---------67:23----------
that's so so but back then like so so


---------67:26----------
not so we had two phone lines at my home


---------67:29----------
so I hosted the server and then what I


---------67:30----------
would do is charge 10 bucks a week for


---------67:34----------
people to get access to my server and it


---------67:37----------
became like a super popular thing and I


---------67:38----------
was making like 300 bucks a week and


---------67:40----------
like that was a lot of money back in


---------67:42----------
like 1990 officer and and so you know I


---------67:47----------
created this thing and then like the


---------67:49----------
funny thing is like my parents were I'm


---------67:50----------
lucky I'm the son of two physicians so


---------67:53----------
my parents like had a big house and like


---------67:55----------
they basically bought me whatever I


---------67:56----------
wanted I didn't need any money so I was


---------67:57----------
like making money and I was making money


---------67:58----------
but sake and making money and I didn't


---------68:00----------
have any way to spend it because like if


---------68:02----------
I wanted something that would just get


---------68:03----------
it for me or what I mean they would get


---------68:06----------
it for me if my grades and stuff we're


---------68:07----------
good and so like one day like like my


---------68:11----------
dad found this gigantic wad of cash and


---------68:14----------
he was like what is this and and then I


---------68:18----------
was like well I stole it and he was like


---------68:22----------
I'm ballin dude I was like no man I he's


---------68:25----------
like you didn't steal it


---------68:26----------
he's like what is this and he's like I


---------68:28----------
told him I like I was like I started a


---------68:30----------
business and I'm making a bunch of money


---------68:32----------
and so then what he did is he took the


---------68:35----------
money away and he shut down the business


---------68:36----------
and he said you've got to focus on your


---------68:39----------
studies like he was actually like proud


---------68:41----------
of me because he like knew that I was an


---------68:42----------
entrepreneur and all that kind of crap


---------68:43----------
so he was like kind of proud but he also


---------68:45----------
like shut it off right like he did what


---------68:47----------
what I mean I think is reasonable for a


---------68:49----------
parent to do which is to say like you


---------68:51----------
should really be focusing on studying


---------68:53----------
like you should do what I think you


---------68:54----------
should do instead of doing what you


---------68:55----------
think you should do sound familiar with


---------68:57----------
your dad by the way and I yep yeah and


---------69:02----------
and then like I realized that in some


---------69:04----------
ways like


---------69:04----------
that left a psychological imprint my dad


---------69:06----------
was like a great person and he loved me


---------69:08----------
a lot and he was a great guy but if you


---------69:10----------
just listened to me talk about that


---------69:12----------
story and how it affected me today


---------69:14----------
that's where my paranoia was born that


---------69:18----------
someone who cares about me and it's a


---------69:19----------
very specific pattern it's as someone


---------69:22----------
who cares about me like is gonna take


---------69:24----------
away what I've built okay right it


---------69:27----------
doesn't make him a bad person it's just


---------69:29----------
like that's what happens because our


---------69:30----------
psychology is imperfect and young minds


---------69:33----------
are impressionable and like they don't


---------69:36----------
understand the complexity of what our


---------69:38----------
parents send us yeah okay so we're good


---------69:43----------
well III have some of that then tell me


---------69:46----------
I think I can't think of something like


---------69:51----------
very much in the past much more


---------69:53----------
something they kind of kind of recent in


---------69:56----------
you know a time we're like I'm looking


---------69:59----------
for that validation or I'm looking for


---------70:01----------
that effect and and I didn't get it and


---------70:04----------
it kind of like didn't mark me but kind


---------70:08----------
of did I just swap because I used to


---------70:14----------
play another game on the stream and then


---------70:15----------
I had swapped this new game over watch


---------70:19----------
and I was trimming it and as we good at


---------70:24----------
the game


---------70:27----------
but I suppose shimmy it a lot right I'd


---------70:29----------
put like a lot of hours and I was


---------70:30----------
enjoying myself a lot sometime


---------70:32----------
no I care about being good me whatever I


---------70:34----------
still get out the stream a lot cuz you


---------70:36----------
know I wanted stream to feel like it's


---------70:40----------
going forward just like my rank and


---------70:41----------
might my plane like pedigree or career


---------70:45----------
order and isn't your heart first because


---------70:51----------
my guess what my guess was really bad


---------70:52----------
it's the it's still it's not the best


---------70:53----------
but I just felt like I want to do that


---------70:57----------
in English cuz I used to in French and


---------70:59----------
that's what I want to do and I want to


---------71:01----------
do good and then I just felt like


---------71:04----------
there's no way there's no I could I


---------71:06----------
could never do it who would listen to


---------71:08----------
some guy who doesn't speak English


---------71:09----------
properly and I just felt like can't like


---------71:14----------
the world's against me to have a thing


---------71:15----------
but I still did it and I would get like


---------71:20----------
small milestones like oh man look today


---------71:22----------
we you know we had like two shells or


---------71:24----------
something and after a while after like a


---------71:27----------
crazy not like grind if you want or


---------71:30----------
whatever I got this uh it was like


---------71:32----------
Christmas there's something and I had a


---------71:34----------
total like I think it was 212 subs I


---------71:39----------
remember he was like 220 h1 to 12 or


---------71:40----------
something and I was like I cannot


---------71:43----------
believe it I think I've just peaked or


---------71:45----------
something like I've plateaued like this


---------71:46----------
is this is it this is like holy [ __ ] I


---------71:50----------
can't believe that two hundred people


---------71:51----------
would subscribe my channel did it and


---------71:53----------
they don't know it's like I'm saying you


---------71:54----------
know and then I finished you off and I


---------71:59----------
had to go to this time


---------72:03----------
was anymore so I had to go to this


---------72:06----------
Christmas party right so I should I show


---------72:09----------
up like like 10 minutes later so think


---------72:10----------
that's you know I was trimming an adult


---------72:13----------
I rushed there and I'll talk to my dad a


---------72:17----------
little bit and family and then I took my


---------72:18----------
dad I'm like yeah you wouldn't believe


---------72:20----------
it like today like I against all these


---------72:23----------
other people that are like competing you


---------72:25----------
know like I had I had this many subs or


---------72:29----------
whatever and I had this much value to my


---------72:32----------
channel well that's crazy and then you


---------72:36----------
kind of just can just look me like the


---------72:39----------
deciding she kind of said it okay so


---------72:43----------
when does that make you go back to


---------72:45----------
school I'm like [ __ ] man


---------72:48----------
they just kind of crush me you know


---------72:54----------
nonsense makes a lot of sense yeah


---------72:57----------
that's crushing


---------73:01----------
felt like it wouldn't matter like what


---------73:04----------
the numbers would be at I felt like that


---------73:06----------
was like a crazy number even though it


---------73:12----------
didn't matter there's any any direction


---------73:13----------
in that path any any Heights it wouldn't


---------73:15----------
matter it'd be irrelevant that's why I


---------73:18----------
start making those systems like the


---------73:19----------
violations from other forms because I


---------73:22----------
play wasn't getting it there you know


---------73:26----------
yeah I think it goes a little bit I mean


---------73:29----------
that's rough man I'm I got emotional


---------73:32----------
hearing that because I think the only


---------73:33----------
where that was going


---------73:35----------
but yeah I think so


---------73:38----------
so here's the thing Felix don't don't


---------73:39----------
get distracted yeah


---------73:42----------
what are you you're looking on no no no


---------73:46----------
it's a guy's stuff I know okay yeah so I


---------73:52----------
think here's the problem you say that


---------73:56----------
you needed to create systems of


---------73:57----------
validation because you weren't getting


---------74:00----------
validation from your dad I think the


---------74:03----------
issue here is it's not validation that


---------74:06----------
you weren't getting from your dad it is


---------74:07----------
fundamental sense of value okay does


---------74:11----------
that make sense like there's a


---------74:12----------
difference doesn't right so like that


---------74:15----------
was the moment that instead of your


---------74:17----------
value as a human being here it came down


---------74:23----------
over here because here you were proud of


---------74:25----------
yourself and you said look I did


---------74:26----------
something I'm proud


---------74:29----------
I accomplished something and then you


---------74:31----------
were up here and then your dad moved you


---------74:32----------
down here in that moment that's when so


---------74:35----------
that's not validation it's it's devalued


---------74:39----------
and then you need validation to fill


---------74:41----------
that gap mm-hmm but before that moment I


---------74:45----------
don't know that you needed any


---------74:46----------
validation does that make sense yeah so


---------74:52----------
a validation like the problem with


---------74:54----------
validation is that like your intrinsic


---------74:55----------
sense of value and now we kind of go


---------74:57----------
back to the beginning of the


---------74:58----------
conversation is like you know impostor


---------75:01----------
syndrome is because you don't believe


---------75:03----------
that the person on stage deserves to be


---------75:06----------
there it's a statement of intrinsic


---------75:08----------
value and then you need validation


---------75:12----------
because that's the only way you can get


---------75:14----------
back up because


---------75:15----------
believe you you're starting down here


---------75:17----------
right it's the [ __ ] bike with the


---------75:20----------
broken chain your whole life it's a bike


---------75:25----------
with a broken [ __ ] chain yeah that


---------75:29----------
might is and that's like that's sad bro


---------75:33----------
is that this is the life yeah because


---------75:38----------
the thing is you don't have a broken


---------75:40----------
chain you you are a thousand dollar bike


---------75:44----------
pawn yeah


---------75:51----------
but you don't see yourself that yeah I


---------75:57----------
grew that in that sin


---------76:00----------
how's that feeling yeah


---------76:08----------
we're going that I don't know I have


---------76:14----------
like it isn't really if I don't want to


---------76:17----------
like oversell myself it doesn't really


---------76:18----------
take me a lot to go on right like it


---------76:22----------
does really like to like do well or do


---------76:29----------
better or improve like there aren't like


---------76:32----------
a lot of requirements that I need to to


---------76:36----------
to go in and do [ __ ] it's an expense


---------76:40----------
yeah I want it yeah I feel more


---------76:42----------
fulfilled if I get it


---------76:43----------
but is it sometimes I feel like I'm more


---------76:47----------
like solid on that without trying to


---------76:50----------
like you know sound like a high go Andy


---------76:53----------
or something no no I don't think it's


---------76:55----------
high ego but let me let me put it I


---------76:57----------
think it's a problem buddy


---------76:58----------
yeah I think so why do you think it's a


---------77:02----------
problem hmm I feel like maybe it makes


---------77:09----------
me like settle settle for Less or


---------77:11----------
something I'm like in a certain way in


---------77:15----------
me and makes me like be okay with like


---------77:20----------
trash yeah absolutely


---------77:23----------
so I well I'm gonna put it a different


---------77:25----------
way okay so you're not feeling a whole


---------77:28----------
lot right now right no why do you think


---------77:31----------
it is that other people have difficulty


---------77:35----------
giving their best because you're saying


---------77:38----------
that I don't have difficulty giving my


---------77:39----------
best right mm-hmm well I think other


---------77:43----------
people like what gets in the way about


---------77:44----------
people getting their best


---------77:49----------
uh-huh


---------77:52----------
I thought about it for a whole minute


---------77:53----------
I'm no clue okay so do you feel a whole


---------77:58----------
lot of emotions Felix oh I'd say less


---------78:05----------
than average yeah so I think part of


---------78:09----------
what makes other people makes it hard


---------78:11----------
for other people to give their best is


---------78:12----------
that they've got like internal [ __ ] that


---------78:15----------
like bogs them down okay and I don't


---------78:18----------
know exactly what you mean by settle for


---------78:19----------
Less but I think part of you giving it


---------78:22----------
your all lets you forget about a lot of


---------78:26----------
things that are probably I imagine


---------78:29----------
hurtful to you and then leave us and I


---------78:32----------
think what we're running up against


---------78:34----------
which is interesting because what you're


---------78:35----------
saying is like some pretty like you know


---------78:36----------
you'll say the word crushing and then


---------78:39----------
the only sign that you have emotional


---------78:41----------
activation is the amount of distraction


---------78:43----------
which you have in your face and where


---------78:46----------
your eyes go so the only sign of emotion


---------78:48----------
that I see in you so you can recognize


---------78:50----------
that something is crushing you can


---------78:52----------
recognize these things and you're


---------78:53----------
learning them but you're not feeling


---------78:55----------
anything you'll look at your hands


---------78:57----------
you'll get distracted by discord maybe


---------78:59----------
it was just escort maybe I'm reading too


---------79:00----------
much into it I have no idea it's really


---------79:02----------
basically one time over the last however


---------79:04----------
long we've been talking that you've like


---------79:06----------
broken eye contact with your screen in


---------79:09----------
like in a particular moment you kind of


---------79:11----------
like looked at your hands for a second


---------79:13----------
yeah and and I don't know so I think


---------79:17----------
you've got feelings down there that are


---------79:20----------
pushed so far down because you've


---------79:23----------
constructed a system of like being your


---------79:26----------
best self and competing and like I think


---------79:29----------
that you know you can say it was


---------79:30----------
crushing but do you remember how it felt


---------79:33----------
when you came to your dad and you were


---------79:36----------
like I got 200 subs I've peaked I've


---------79:38----------
made it on Twitch


---------79:44----------
yeah I think I'm Ambria I think I yeah


---------79:48----------
how did it feel


---------79:54----------
[Music]


---------79:58----------
you still like like


---------80:00----------
[Music]


---------80:01----------
like I felt like so ready to to get


---------80:05----------
something and they're the exact opposite


---------80:07----------
you know sometimes you can like protect


---------80:10----------
yourself with like some like


---------80:13----------
expectations or something yeah right


---------80:15----------
nothing's pretty much so I don't where


---------80:18----------
like you know like a fishing rod did


---------80:20----------
sometimes you know um you know you don't


---------80:25----------
expect much you know you put it like


---------80:27----------
close you know whatever but that was


---------80:29----------
like an i overextended like I'm all in


---------80:31----------
my pool


---------80:32----------
y'all know that I know I'm gonna get it


---------80:34----------
so Felix went why do we protect


---------80:36----------
ourselves like that why do we expect so


---------80:40----------
little from the fishing rod where does


---------80:42----------
that protection come from so like what


---------80:44----------
are we tanking what I mean so you're


---------80:49----------
saying you said something about you know


---------80:52----------
having low expectations and how low


---------80:54----------
expectations are protective yeah okay so


---------80:58----------
like you play over much right so like


---------81:00----------
you know those low expectations are like


---------81:02----------
Reinhart and his shield and like what's


---------81:05----------
behind Reinhart like what are we what


---------81:09----------
are we tanking there


---------81:10----------
if those a flow X if you didn't set


---------81:13----------
artificially low expectations for


---------81:15----------
yourself what would happen more intense


---------81:21----------
disappointment when you don't get it


---------81:23----------
absolutely and even then more intense


---------81:26----------
disappointment is a really cerebral way


---------81:28----------
of saying it hurts okay you're


---------81:31----------
protecting yourself from hurt yeah I


---------81:34----------
don't really use those words real often


---------81:35----------
you don't use those words for you


---------81:37----------
bad I know yeah so you're hyper


---------81:39----------
analytical and you're LexA thymic what


---------81:42----------
Alexa 5ik means is that you're unaware


---------81:44----------
of what your internal emotional state is


---------81:46----------
and I don't think you like you can use


---------81:47----------
words like crushing you can use physical


---------81:50----------
words right you can use words that are


---------81:52----------
like crushing is like a physical thing


---------81:55----------
mm-hmm


---------81:56----------
it has a representation in the real


---------81:57----------
world and men do this often it's like


---------81:59----------
you know you can talk like you don't


---------82:01----------
talk about pride or satisfaction you


---------82:04----------
talk about like rolling news Yeah right


---------82:07----------
that's an emotion rolling newbs is like


---------82:09----------
it's an emotion but you just don't have


---------82:11----------
the language and everyone understands


---------82:13----------
what we mean because our whole job


---------82:15----------
raishin is like emotionally sunk because


---------82:19----------
we play video games and stuff and like


---------82:20----------
we don't spend time like inside


---------82:22----------
ourselves it really is and and I think


---------82:26----------
that buddy like so you know I'm gonna


---------82:28----------
offer a couple of thoughts because I


---------82:30----------
don't really know exactly what where to


---------82:32----------
explore from here and I kind of want to


---------82:34----------
say so I've also noticed something that


---------82:36----------
when we explore too far we lose some of


---------82:38----------
the things that we learned at the


---------82:39----------
beginning yeah there's good data to that


---------82:42----------
so I'm gonna try to leave you with a


---------82:44----------
couple of thoughts the first thing is I


---------82:45----------
think you've really got to think long


---------82:47----------
and hard about you know how you feel


---------82:49----------
about your dad not being proud of you


---------82:54----------
mm-hmm and cuz I just don't think that


---------82:57----------
you deserve a life where like your value


---------83:01----------
is down here when it's really appear cuz


---------83:04----------
you are a thousand dollar bike you're


---------83:05----------
not and there's a certain amount of like


---------83:07----------
you know underdog pride with with being


---------83:11----------
down here and still achieving up here


---------83:14----------
like I can sympathize with that there's


---------83:17----------
a some pride in that but I just don't I


---------83:19----------
just don't think that like when it comes


---------83:21----------
to the self-sabotage and impostor


---------83:22----------
syndrome and all this kind of [ __ ] you


---------83:25----------
know because people people do genuinely


---------83:28----------
care about you I mean I'm making


---------83:30----------
assumptions here but I'm pretty sure


---------83:31----------
because that's what I've seen from


---------83:32----------
twitch at everyone talks about twitch I


---------83:34----------
like that they're toxic but I think that


---------83:36----------
there's like a lot of genuine caring and


---------83:39----------
respect does yeah and and I think I


---------83:43----------
think it's I mean it's it's gotta like


---------83:45----------
it's got to be about your dad and by


---------83:48----------
about what I mean is like I think you've


---------83:49----------
got a you know maybe at some point first


---------83:52----------
of all figure out how you feel and then


---------83:54----------
then engage your dad I don't know if you


---------83:57----------
guys have ever talked about like what


---------83:59----------
success means to him and why he cares so


---------84:02----------
much so the last thing that I want to


---------84:04----------
leave you with is that all this [ __ ]


---------84:06----------
about your dad's expectations on you are


---------84:09----------
probably coming from his own sense of


---------84:11----------
not doing good enough because that's


---------84:14----------
what parents do okay Beckham I could see


---------84:17----------
that right so if he's hyper competitive


---------84:19----------
and egotistical and he has a son who is


---------84:23----------
far more successful than he'll ever be


---------84:25----------
which I don't know if that's true or not


---------84:27----------
I don't know how


---------84:28----------
successfully is and I really know how


---------84:30----------
successful you are like I'm know right


---------84:32----------
but if that thought is in his head that


---------84:34----------
could be difficult for him to sit with


---------84:36----------
but that's not that's not something that


---------84:38----------
should lower your value that's something


---------84:41----------
that he needs to deal with okay why does


---------84:46----------
he need his son to be number one and in


---------84:51----------
yeah in in in a realm where that


---------84:55----------
couldn't change then what is it not okay


---------84:59----------
to have systems where you where you get


---------85:01----------
that from or other things if you let's


---------85:05----------
say if that all I said was the truth and


---------85:07----------
he couldn't change then what so you're


---------85:11----------
absolutely right so the systems are


---------85:12----------
there for a damn good reason right so


---------85:16----------
like like what I'm yeah so then what


---------85:20----------
then I think you guys accept you breve


---------85:22----------
and you move past it and what that means


---------85:25----------
is like you know if I'm juggling and I


---------85:28----------
drop a ball then what Felix I'm sure


---------85:32----------
absolutely right so it like like you you


---------85:38----------
don't let that failure stop so if your


---------85:42----------
dad like your dad needs to figure out


---------85:44----------
like why he wants his son to be so


---------85:46----------
successful like does he derived personal


---------85:49----------
pride and ego from your successes


---------85:51----------
cuz that happens a lot with parents and


---------85:53----------
then the second thing is why can't he


---------85:56----------
accept your success for what it is why


---------85:59----------
does it have to look like his success


---------86:01----------
okay that's that's it then you have it


---------86:05----------
then I have what I feel like that


---------86:10----------
question is is the right one yeah or the


---------86:12----------
most the most fun was that when I had


---------86:14----------
out of all exactly and that comes from a


---------86:18----------
conversation with him and the cool thing


---------86:19----------
is that once you can have that


---------86:21----------
conversation with him and you can get


---------86:22----------
the answer that question then you're no


---------86:24----------
longer down here because what put you


---------86:26----------
down here is like his impression of


---------86:29----------
what's valued mm-hmm then you're back up


---------86:32----------
here and then you're you know you're a


---------86:34----------
thousand dollar bike riding a thousand


---------86:35----------
dollar bike like that's what you are


---------86:38----------
you're not like a broken chain because


---------86:40----------
if we look at your actual performance


---------86:42----------
we see the performance of a thousand


---------86:44----------
dollar bike not the performance of a


---------86:45----------
broken chain and that you've


---------86:47----------
demonstrated time and time and time


---------86:49----------
again by schooling noobs and trampoline


---------86:52----------
schooling noobs and skiing schooling


---------86:53----------
noobs right and left and center right


---------86:55----------
you're competing with like your dad


---------86:57----------
sends you in to compete with kids with


---------86:59----------
multi-thousand dollar bikes and you've


---------87:01----------
got a broken chain you're [ __ ]


---------87:02----------
winning a race and you have to stop and


---------87:04----------
pull over and reattach me yeah yeah and


---------87:10----------
in those moments I felt like I was upset


---------87:17----------
that they wouldn't get when do the


---------87:17----------
results but I was very much like self


---------87:20----------
self rewarded and I had a good mint


---------87:23----------
mental loop cuz yeah it sucks I don't


---------87:27----------
get on the podium but at the same time I


---------87:30----------
was like dude if I had a bike as good as


---------87:33----------
theirs I know like it's not that doesn't


---------87:36----------
come from like over at all you my value


---------87:37----------
like I would have [ __ ] this guy over I


---------87:39----------
ought to roll them right and and that


---------87:42----------
that thought was enough yeah I'm with


---------87:45----------
you I think ok right so but but the


---------87:49----------
problem here is that you don't think


---------87:51----------
that way about yourself now right you


---------87:55----------
think the opposite mmm probably not yeah


---------87:57----------
exactly


---------87:58----------
reisen's so like I think and then we


---------88:01----------
kind of ask a little bit about won't I


---------88:02----------
become not successful no absolutely not


---------88:04----------
because that is actually when you're


---------88:07----------
your truest self it's when you don't


---------88:09----------
derive value from an external thing do


---------88:11----------
you see that in that moment you're not


---------88:13----------
deriving value from being on stage


---------88:15----------
you're deriving value from a true sense


---------88:17----------
of what you're putting in and what


---------88:18----------
you're capable of


---------88:19----------
hmm then you don't care about the


---------88:22----------
audience and can you be successful


---------88:25----------
absolutely


---------88:31----------
tarts questions known as does all this


---------88:34----------
Oh mittens


---------88:41----------
is it overall unhealthy in the


---------88:45----------
immigrants into things like lifestyle to


---------88:50----------
to let's say not care about about what


---------88:54----------
your parents think we're like build


---------88:56----------
yourself in an environment where you get


---------89:01----------
like a combined other things that make


---------89:03----------
up for that let me make up for the mega


---------89:05----------
for their value or their so I think how


---------89:10----------
healthiest thing is done it's not to not


---------89:12----------
care it's to recognize what part of my


---------89:16----------
parents value of me is fair and what


---------89:19----------
part is unfair okay let me as lessons


---------89:25----------
yeah because they're evaluation of you


---------89:29----------
is not perfect yeah I think that's a


---------89:33----------
problem where you're growing up you


---------89:39----------
can't really can't really tell tens of


---------89:42----------
your parents they're above you so


---------89:43----------
they're they know [ __ ] but sometimes


---------89:46----------
they do things just like we did like I


---------89:50----------
dunno like that we're human right that


---------89:53----------
are that are that are wrong but I still


---------89:55----------
see it as right because I don't know any


---------89:58----------
better so like they play their cards


---------90:00----------
perfectly and that's how they really


---------90:01----------
feel


---------90:01----------
and I mean but maybe that's how they


---------90:02----------
feel about themselves or some external


---------90:04----------
other source right and then actually


---------90:07----------
feel I feel like you kind of build like


---------90:10----------
just unhealthy conclusions absolutely


---------90:14----------
right so I think the general strategy


---------90:16----------
like so when I say you have to see


---------90:18----------
what's fair and unfair like you said do


---------90:22----------
you think that they're perfect when


---------90:23----------
you're a child and they're certainly not


---------90:25----------
perfect and we don't blame them for that


---------90:28----------
right because they also like they're not


---------90:30----------
perfect so how can you expect perfection


---------90:32----------
from them so I think the strategy Felix


---------90:34----------
is damage control not perfection it's


---------90:38----------
not being perfect it's in recognizing


---------90:40----------
like so the way for it is to have


---------90:41----------
conversations with them well then you


---------90:43----------
can through conversation with them like


---------90:45----------
recognize okay what is my dad saying


---------90:47----------
that's fair and what is he saying that's


---------90:49----------
unfair and then once you recognize that


---------90:51----------
it's unfair you let it go fine let's go


---------90:55----------
it's like that shit's on him like if


---------90:58----------
he's not happy with me having a broken


---------91:00----------
chain bike and not winning first place


---------91:03----------
like that's an unreasonable expectation


---------91:05----------
and if he doesn't want to be proud of me


---------91:07----------
for that then so be it I'm gonna make my


---------91:09----------
case about why he shouldn't be proud of


---------91:11----------
me right I need to explain to him and


---------91:15----------
and and then that gives him the


---------91:17----------
opportunity to also grow because you're


---------91:19----------
not the only one that needs to do


---------91:20----------
growing in this relationship


---------91:21----------
and it's kind of like a continual


---------91:24----------
process in the same way that you like


---------91:26----------
wake up the next day and you try to be


---------91:27----------
better that's what both of you guys need


---------91:30----------
to do for your relationship and then


---------91:32----------
you'll end up hopefully both being like


---------91:34----------
happy and accepting and loving each


---------91:35----------
other and you know he'll be proud of you


---------91:38----------
and you'll know that he's genuinely


---------91:39----------
proud of you and he can accept that you


---------91:42----------
aren't him right you're not his perfect


---------91:46----------
dream of himself you're you and you have


---------91:50----------
your own [ __ ] that you care about your


---------91:52----------
own values and there are parts of you


---------91:54----------
that there are parts of him that live


---------91:57----------
within you but there are also parts of


---------91:58----------
your mom there are parts of you that are


---------92:01----------
a little bit more chill there are parts


---------92:02----------
of you that say that I'm gonna stop


---------92:04----------
skiing and like snowboard because it's


---------92:06----------
fun and I'm still gonna do a really good


---------92:08----------
job but it's gonna be less intense


---------92:10----------
mm-hmm okay in that he needs to judge


---------92:13----------
you for who you are not who he wants you


---------92:17----------
to be and even in that you may fall


---------92:20----------
short in some ways he may say okay Felix


---------92:22----------
I agree with you that you know you've


---------92:24----------
been successful and I'm proud of you but


---------92:26----------
I still think X Y Z yeah and then for


---------92:30----------
you to say okay dad that's fair that


---------92:31----------
isn't fair and then you guys come to an


---------92:33----------
accord and that's a healthy relationship


---------92:41----------
yeah


---------92:45----------
yeah I I think I'm uh I think I'm


---------92:47----------
getting them here I mean I understand


---------92:50----------
like the like the full scope of the full


---------92:54----------
scope of things it's almost like at the


---------92:57----------
same time it's kind of like most people


---------93:00----------
that do good on Twitter kind of like


---------93:02----------
like degenerate or I mean I mean not


---------93:06----------
most of us and I will put throws on the


---------93:08----------
same boat it's kinda like almost kind of


---------93:10----------
like being like a failure or something


---------93:12----------
yeah being like a bomber right being


---------93:15----------
such a bomb that is like one of the like


---------93:17----------
things that make you makes you good on


---------93:18----------
Twitter something that's also was


---------93:20----------
something that that doesn't sit well


---------93:23----------
your your parents so I think it's gonna


---------93:25----------
weird to be kinda like rewarded for such


---------93:30----------
like that am I getting that is an i


---------93:33----------
sense it makes perfect sense and I think


---------93:34----------
there's a there's a difference in value


---------93:36----------
between the boomer generation in our


---------93:38----------
generation mm-hmm there's like a


---------93:40----------
conversation that needs to be had like


---------93:43----------
basically I mean I have this


---------93:44----------
conversation with my parents too about


---------93:45----------
like where value comes from right so she


---------93:49----------
has certain ideas about like what I


---------93:53----------
should be and and we just have to have a


---------93:57----------
conversation about like you know some of


---------93:59----------
the ways that I raise my kids and and


---------94:01----------
things like that and and so she's like


---------94:03----------
oh that's not the right way to do it


---------94:05----------
right your dad's issue is that you're


---------94:07----------
not successful in the right place yeah


---------94:10----------
that's it and and like this is just like


---------94:13----------
they don't get to determine what's right


---------94:15----------
right we have our own perspective and we


---------94:18----------
don't get to determine what's right


---------94:19----------
either


---------94:20----------
like what's right comes like from a


---------94:22----------
conversation and the cord between the


---------94:24----------
two of us and I mean I think you know I


---------94:29----------
know I wish I'm gonna have to think a


---------94:32----------
little bit Felix because I think just a


---------94:34----------
couple of closing thoughts so I think


---------94:36----------
there are a couple things you can work


---------94:37----------
on one is you know to think about how to


---------94:39----------
have a conversation with your dad


---------94:40----------
because I think that actually needs to


---------94:41----------
happen at some point and and the second


---------94:45----------
though is to really figure out like I do


---------94:48----------
think you're Alexa thymic which means


---------94:49----------
you don't really you're not really in


---------94:50----------
touch with your emotions and and I don't


---------94:53----------
know if you I mean sometimes like people


---------94:55----------
who are not really in touch with their


---------94:57----------
emotions they come out and


---------94:58----------
he's like oftentimes frustration or


---------95:00----------
anger or toxicity and so I think a big


---------95:03----------
part of toxicity on the internet and on


---------95:05----------
twitch comes from like people having


---------95:08----------
these kinds of issues or like your dad


---------95:09----------
is fundamentally not proud of you and


---------95:11----------
like that's hard to live with like every


---------95:14----------
single day right and that hurts and then


---------95:17----------
like what happens when we get hurt like


---------95:19----------
if I slap you across the face what are


---------95:21----------
you gonna do yeah I'll G and then what


---------95:27----------
and then afterward till it heals sure


---------95:30----------
but you're not gonna hit back um yeah


---------95:37----------
maybe maybe not okay I'm sorry I I think


---------95:42----------
I'm not giving you the the correct the


---------95:44----------
credit


---------95:44----------
I should no no but but that's that's


---------95:47----------
perfectly fine right so it's not like


---------95:49----------
once again it's not me it's not for me


---------95:51----------
to know what the correct answer is when


---------95:53----------
you give me an answer that I'm not


---------95:54----------
expecting what your spot on that's not


---------95:58----------
that wasn't what I expected I don't try


---------96:00----------
to convince you that I'm right I stop


---------96:02----------
and put myself in your shoes and then


---------96:04----------
the truth is gonna be somewhere in the


---------96:05----------
middle okay so let me put it a better


---------96:08----------
analogy that will give me the answer


---------96:09----------
that I want right when someone like when


---------96:11----------
you're playing a game of overwatch and


---------96:13----------
like you know they take the point or


---------96:14----------
whatever and then you're like yeah I'm


---------96:16----------
gonna [ __ ] him right yeah you hit back


---------96:18----------
yeah and and so when we're hurt what we


---------96:22----------
respond with his anger okay and I was


---------96:25----------
reading I mean so I sort of realized


---------96:27----------
this one day when I was reading one of


---------96:28----------
the manifestos or one of these school


---------96:30----------
shooters and at the bottom of all of


---------96:33----------
that man yeah go ahead okay [ __ ] effect


---------96:36----------
a bruni story no more I feel like over


---------96:40----------
time I have this new sort of system or


---------96:43----------
loop that I do where when things like


---------96:46----------
that happen or something or somebody


---------96:48----------
punches right I I punch but not by using


---------96:54----------
like my face or something is that make


---------96:56----------
sense sure I punch another way that's


---------96:58----------
more like subtle or like calculate or


---------97:03----------
something right


---------97:04----------
where something like


---------97:07----------
[ __ ] me over I'm not gonna I'm not


---------97:08----------
gonna [ __ ] them over I'm gonna visit if


---------97:11----------
you're gonna dismantle them yeah but you


---------97:15----------
lose yeah you're gay


---------97:18----------
yeah I'm with you we could get into that


---------97:20----------
too that's that's a cold anger it's not


---------97:23----------
a haunting okay right there's a but the


---------97:26----------
anger is still there my friend mm-hmm


---------97:29----------
right it's just it's just not you're not


---------97:31----------
gonna hit back you're gonna say ow and


---------97:33----------
then you're gonna figure out how to


---------97:34----------
dismantle me oh okay that that's


---------97:36----------
interesting then yeah yeah I like that


---------97:38----------
thought yeah that's still anger I like


---------97:41----------
that


---------97:41----------
yep because sometimes I'll like I guess


---------97:47----------
falsely tell myself I'll be like man


---------97:52----------
like that you know that's you're not


---------97:55----------
doing it out of anger you know like I'm


---------97:56----------
just doing that because it's it's the


---------97:58----------
right thing or like I'm myself like a


---------98:00----------
self-righteous that I have angle but


---------98:02----------
it's still it's still trash you know no


---------98:04----------
it may not be trash okay that's a whole


---------98:07----------
different issue right so so what your


---------98:09----------
actions may be just but your actions


---------98:12----------
being just and and whether they're


---------98:14----------
whether there's anger there or separate


---------98:16----------
or separate questions mm-hmm all right


---------98:19----------
cuz if I smack you across the face like


---------98:21----------
you hurting me in some way could be just


---------98:25----------
but I think it doesn't surprise me that


---------98:28----------
you don't feel anger but it's a cold


---------98:31----------
fury because I think the bigger thing is


---------98:34----------
like so in anyway so I think they're


---------98:36----------
like two general directions Felix that


---------98:38----------
you need to go the three actually so one


---------98:41----------
you're already doing and really good at


---------98:43----------
and that's to learn and analyze your


---------98:44----------
systems which I think you've done a


---------98:46----------
phenomenal job I don't think we could


---------98:47----------
have gotten this far in the conversation


---------98:49----------
unless you had a pretty good attention


---------98:52----------
to the systems that you develop over


---------98:55----------
time even if they don't make perfect


---------98:56----------
sense to you you know what they are at


---------98:58----------
least which is awesome so continue


---------99:00----------
learning because there may be sudden T's


---------99:01----------
which are not so I can think is I think


---------99:03----------
at some point you've got to settle to


---------99:04----------
[ __ ] with your dad and that could be


---------99:06----------
through a conversation with him it could


---------99:08----------
be through therapy it could be through


---------99:09----------
any number of things but this is this


---------99:11----------
thing is not at peace right like there's


---------99:15----------
something about like you still accept


---------99:17----------
his view on some level and that needs to


---------99:20----------
be dealt like


---------99:21----------
awareness huh the third thing is that I


---------99:24----------
think you need to better understand what


---------99:25----------
your emotions are and what you're


---------99:26----------
feeling because I think you've got all


---------99:28----------
kinds of stuff when you talk about these


---------99:29----------
thoughts I think the fuel for those


---------99:32----------
kinds of thought loops and negative


---------99:33----------
thought patterns comes from because you


---------99:36----------
call them thought right all you


---------99:39----------
experiences the thoughts but like where


---------99:41----------
is the fuel for that coming from it's


---------99:43----------
probably coming from sopressa music yeah


---------99:47----------
and so the third kind of dimension for


---------99:49----------
your growth is to like you know to put


---------99:51----------
it bluntly get in touch with your


---------99:52----------
feelings and I don't know if you're like


---------99:54----------
in a romantic relationship or what the


---------99:57----------
deal is there but like when it comes to


---------99:59----------
those like you know getting this [ __ ]


---------100:00----------
and order is like really important to


---------100:02----------
having like a healthy romantic


---------100:03----------
relationship because unless you know


---------100:05----------
like when she he or she does something


---------100:07----------
that upsets you like if you don't feel


---------100:09----------
that upset and can't vocalize that to


---------100:11----------
her you're just gonna dismantle her or


---------100:14----------
him depending on what your sexual


---------100:16----------
preferences okay you know and and so we


---------100:19----------
can talk about relationships or whatever


---------100:21----------
at a different point but does that make


---------100:22----------
sense


---------100:23----------
like you got to know like what's going


---------100:24----------
on yeah Andres husband's I understand


---------100:28----------
her thoughts or questions before we wrap


---------100:30----------
up no I think I understand um yeah these


---------100:34----------
things many lessons you take aways from


---------100:35----------
today you mind if I ask why what time is


---------100:39----------
it


---------100:39----------
I know I know do you wanna keep talking


---------100:41----------
cause like we been out


---------100:42----------
oh oh I I didn't have time I lost look


---------100:46----------
at time


---------100:46----------
I enjoyed that the nerves really good um


---------100:50----------
not really


---------100:51----------
I mean I have like it's almost like


---------100:54----------
every topic has like a bunch of branches


---------100:56----------
I was like I could go with that okay


---------100:59----------
what we're gonna instead and and you


---------101:02----------
know I I feel complete but there's no


---------101:06----------
sense like there's still a lot left to


---------101:08----------
talk about


---------101:08----------
yeah it's okay though yeah I I was


---------101:12----------
wondering if you could try to summarize


---------101:14----------
cuz like you know people are watching


---------101:15----------
like what do you think what do you think


---------101:18----------
are some highlights like what do you


---------101:20----------
think are some of the key points what


---------101:22----------
are the not the branches but like you


---------101:24----------
know the big stems that then could be


---------101:26----------
explored the big


---------101:30----------
that can be explored yeah what are the


---------101:32----------
things that you took away from the


---------101:33----------
conversation if anything oh okay


---------101:36----------
I think sometimes you say something


---------101:39----------
right like a statement and it kind of


---------101:44----------
simplifies my viewpoint on it like all


---------101:50----------
like overcomplicate something or I'll


---------101:52----------
see like in a weird way


---------101:54----------
and then you'll say like oh like if I


---------101:57----------
really resent it that's still anger


---------101:59----------
right it's such a simple answer but it's


---------102:02----------
okay it's just like a simple thoughts


---------102:04----------
but it resonates a lot and there's a


---------102:07----------
couple things that you did it leeches


---------102:08----------
like that you said like that like Oh


---------102:11----------
like really when he said oh that's pain


---------102:13----------
but you say thought you said you say in


---------102:15----------
another way or something mm-hmm like and


---------102:20----------
these things are easy to easy to take


---------102:23----------
home easy to okay because yeah I like a


---------102:27----------
lot it's it simplifies it it makes it


---------102:31----------
way more approachable mentally like it's


---------102:34----------
not oh it's not all broken no or it's


---------102:36----------
not like a so it's that complicates like


---------102:38----------
a crazy process it's as simple as you


---------102:41----------
know that's just a feeling or just that


---------102:43----------
yeah okay thanks for from yeah John no


---------102:50----------
go ahead look I was doing nothing I'm


---------102:54----------
just gonna say so sometimes I teach


---------102:55----------
people meditation are you interested in


---------102:57----------
that um I'm not really good at it where


---------103:04----------
I


---------103:05----------
maybe you heard about this before since


---------103:06----------
you're in that sort of feel but um


---------103:10----------
biofeedback and huh no no feedback


---------103:13----------
uh-huh


---------103:14----------
ever heard about that yep okay and uh I


---------103:18----------
had to learn it like breathe and and and


---------103:22----------
sort of method is the can't they kind of


---------103:24----------
were like hand in hand right yeah like


---------103:26----------
breathing properly like uh was it called


---------103:28----------
again dude


---------103:30----------
when you breathe through like the bottom


---------103:31----------
of the lungs or something abdominal


---------103:33----------
breathing yeah that okay so uh you're


---------103:37----------
you're not good at it yeah I'm not good


---------103:44----------
at getting a hold of my thoughts like if


---------103:48----------
I'm okay okay nobody's ready this is a


---------103:53----------
little different I don't know what is


---------103:55----------
your time is this gonna take too long no


---------103:57----------
go for a media are you like on a set


---------104:00----------
schedule is like very tight


---------104:01----------
let me check real quick sure and don't


---------104:04----------
know if it is like it I'm not gonna get


---------104:06----------
mad it's like no no I appreciate your


---------104:08----------
consideration man sure it's very kind of


---------104:11----------
you nope we're good okay so


---------104:21----------
I remember it's a Tetris syndrome or


---------104:23----------
whatever Tetris syndrome


---------104:25----------
ya know where you do an action for so


---------104:30----------
long and so much time in one day or a


---------104:34----------
couple days that even when you're not


---------104:36----------
doing it it's still happening in your


---------104:38----------
head okay like like I've been playing a


---------104:42----------
lot of chess on an off stream and the


---------104:44----------
entire time we talk today like it's like


---------104:46----------
the entire time I had I had pieces I


---------104:49----------
could visibly see like almost in my


---------104:51----------
vision and if they kept just kept moving


---------104:52----------
the whole time and I kept like


---------104:54----------
practicing like certain moves or


---------104:56----------
something does that make sense yeah it's


---------104:59----------
it's like it's so vivid that it's like


---------105:02----------
um it's always there right and I do that


---------105:05----------
with like streaming and playing games so


---------105:07----------
we're even when I'm not doing them it's


---------105:10----------
like always happening like I'm I keep


---------105:13----------
playing my head but it's it's always


---------105:17----------
there so whenever I try to like meditate


---------105:19----------
or calm down it it's really hard to not


---------105:23----------
think about anything or think about


---------105:24----------
something and just feel like let things


---------105:27----------
flow you know I mean and without being


---------105:31----------
completely disrupted by my head just


---------105:34----------
playing that game again or or doing that


---------105:38----------
action that I did all day it's just so


---------105:39----------
overwhelming right so it's all yeah okay


---------105:45----------
thanks for sharing that very that's


---------105:48----------
gonna hug yeah it's kinda hard to get a


---------105:50----------
hold of my thoughts whenever I try to


---------105:52----------
like calm and chill like it gets under


---------105:55----------
control really bats I think the problem


---------105:56----------
is not that you need to get ahold of


---------105:57----------
your thoughts I think you need to let


---------105:58----------
him go


---------105:59----------
okay that's why you're not good at


---------106:02----------
meditating because meditating is not


---------106:05----------
about holding on to your thoughts it's


---------106:06----------
about letting him go it's like you're


---------106:08----------
moving in the opposite direction


---------106:10----------
uh-huh alright it's sort of like you


---------106:14----------
know so Felix how do you go to sleep I


---------106:18----------
usually just


---------106:19----------
ask myself I can't and I haven't really


---------106:23----------
actually gonna sleep and I don't know


---------106:25----------
the longest time yeah just uh yeah right


---------106:30----------
so so so sleep is not something that you


---------106:32----------
can do it's something that you have to


---------106:34----------
like it like it that's that happen to


---------106:36----------
you


---------106:36----------
all right so sleep is not about you


---------106:38----------
don't go to sleep you let sleep take you


---------106:41----------
and what you have to do to let sleep


---------106:43----------
take you is to be very very exhausted


---------106:46----------
otherwise sleep won't come and take you


---------106:49----------
does that make sense you don't do it it


---------106:52----------
it does you like it's the other way


---------106:54----------
around yeah and so I think you


---------106:56----------
absolutely need to meditate but you need


---------106:58----------
to meditate in the opposite direction


---------107:00----------
from what you're trying to do and I just


---------107:01----------
need a second to think about how to do


---------107:03----------
that I have a particular technique that


---------107:05----------
I think would work very well for you


---------107:06----------
it's just we can't do it on streem is


---------107:08----------
the problem okay what is it I'm just a


---------107:11----------
so so what I tell people to do is like


---------107:13----------
so I you know I used to teach this stuff


---------107:14----------
in a hospital like in my office and so


---------107:17----------
what I would do is take people down to


---------107:18----------
the cafeteria of the hospital and I tell


---------107:21----------
them to close their eyes and listen to


---------107:23----------
as many sounds that they hear as quickly


---------107:26----------
as they can for a short amount of time


---------107:28----------
as possible so just listen to like a


---------107:32----------
glass clinking over here someone's on


---------107:33----------
their phone someone's walking by someone


---------107:35----------
spilled something there's a baby crying


---------107:37----------
someone you know banged silverware


---------107:40----------
together there's a cash register that


---------107:42----------
ding but there's another cellphone


---------107:43----------
someone's coming down the stairs there's


---------107:45----------
an elevator that beeped you know there's


---------107:48----------
someone's something's moving over here


---------107:50----------
there's a dog barking and just to listen


---------107:53----------
to as many sounds as you can as quickly


---------107:55----------
as you can ok if you want to meditate


---------107:59----------
what you need to do is not slow your


---------108:01----------
mind down you need to speed it up ok so


---------108:05----------
there's a there's a good kind of saying


---------108:07----------
in meditation which is how do you get a


---------108:08----------
monkey to sit still which is like hard


---------108:11----------
to translate into the West because we


---------108:12----------
don't have monkeys and and you know if


---------108:15----------
you want a monkey to sit still what you


---------108:16----------
have to do is exhaust it right you can't


---------108:19----------
like force a monkey you can't hold it in


---------108:21----------
place it's just gonna go crazier and


---------108:22----------
crazier and crazier and so what we need


---------108:25----------
to do for you to meditate is for


---------108:27----------
meditation to take you you need to


---------108:30----------
exhaust your mind and


---------108:33----------
I almost say like let me just think


---------108:52----------
I mean do you want to try something or


---------108:54----------
you're okay just and I'm not trying to


---------108:57----------
pressure you I just want to know where


---------108:58----------
you are


---------108:59----------
so anything element okay well good


---------109:02----------
whatever so what does that do when you


---------109:07----------
think about a lot of sounds what does


---------109:09----------
that do I'm gonna show you hope just


---------109:15----------
give me a second I think showing you is


---------109:17----------
gonna be way easier than telling you I


---------109:21----------
just have to think about how much to


---------109:23----------
engage your mind


---------109:31----------
okay so I want you to sit up straight


---------109:36----------
[Music]


---------109:40----------
think let me think let me think we don't


---------109:43----------
want to overdo it that's okay maybe he


---------109:46----------
will be easier so I wonder if doing


---------109:49----------
things with your body is gonna be easier


---------109:54----------
are you stay yeah how tall you're tall


---------109:59----------
yeah


---------110:08----------
okay yeah sure we can do something


---------110:11----------
standing so okay let's just stop


---------110:17----------
extending all right jack


---------110:19----------
all right so it's gonna be really simple


---------110:22----------
well let's just see what happens okay


---------110:24----------
okay sounds good


---------110:26----------
we're gonna so that I was asking you to


---------110:28----------
sit up straight but you're standing now


---------110:30----------
so let's run with it it means just sit


---------110:35----------
sit with your back straight that's okay


---------110:37----------
don't worry about it


---------110:37----------
no no no we're gonna run with it I think


---------110:42----------
this is great okay I'm gonna stand up


---------110:44----------
so I can it's not a big deal okay so


---------110:55----------
this is what I want you to do so stand


---------110:58----------
up straight yeah feet together arms by


---------111:01----------
your side and then I want you to as you


---------111:05----------
inhale I want you to raise your arms and


---------111:12----------
then the


---------111:14----------
I don't know like with my nose your eyes


---------111:16----------
it's fine right right and then exhale


---------111:26----------
and as you exhale I want you to bring


---------111:29----------
your arms down to where when you fully


---------111:31----------
exhale your arms should be at the bottom


---------111:33----------
so you want to match the involution with


---------111:36----------
the match the movement of your arms with


---------111:39----------
your breast


---------111:39----------
okay okay so yeah breathe in


---------111:48----------
and then out okay way too fast


---------111:56----------
so death yeah so I want you to look at


---------112:00----------
the pacing of my arms and follow your


---------112:02----------
breath long


---------112:16----------
now is your breath matching your arms or


---------112:19----------
no no so you've got a focus on yeah yeah


---------112:24----------
so your arms should not be moving your


---------112:29----------
arms should only be moving while you are


---------112:31----------
breathing in or out okay and I'm gonna


---------112:33----------
spoil when I was about this one I was


---------112:35----------
already done yeah then you need to slow


---------112:37----------
down your breath


---------112:54----------
slowing down your breath that's perfect


---------112:57----------
huh


---------112:58----------
that was perfect that was perfect okay


---------113:00----------
so close your eyes and and do five up on


---------113:02----------
your okay Hebrew slow


---------113:20----------
good again


---------113:35----------
good keep going now keep your arm


---------113:38----------
movements even so you can't speed up or


---------113:41----------
slow down it has to be even with your


---------113:44----------
breath the entire time


---------113:50----------
again


---------114:02----------
duh keep going and now I want you to


---------114:06----------
tell me as you're keeping track of your


---------114:08----------
breath and your arms I want you to tell


---------114:10----------
me about which chest moves you see in


---------114:12----------
your mind


---------114:21----------
do you see chess moves in your mind no


---------114:26----------
Vincent for a while think about them and


---------114:29----------
continue doing the practice from I'll


---------114:32----------
call the chess game keep your breath


---------114:35----------
even keep your arms even think about


---------114:37----------
chess


---------114:40----------
do you hear one of those in breath slow


---------114:43----------
keep it even and think about chess at


---------114:45----------
the same time very fast slow down slow


---------114:51----------
breath slow slow slow breath keeping


---------114:54----------
arms even in slow yeah good what's


---------114:59----------
happening I'm feeling good


---------115:03----------
why I'm doing what are the other


---------115:06----------
robotically


---------115:10----------
so let your full attention return to the


---------115:13----------
breath arms up slow even and then down


---------115:21----------
smooth


---------115:27----------
notice that your arms may be getting


---------115:29----------
tired and Soviet we're gonna do three


---------115:31----------
more it's slowly smoothly infinitely as


---------115:35----------
you can now


---------115:44----------
again


---------115:50----------
and out last one slow smooth and even


---------116:04----------
and out


---------116:09----------
later eyes remain closed


---------116:13----------
spread your feet apart a little bit and


---------116:16----------
just sit in your mind


---------116:26----------
notice this natural breath that your


---------116:31----------
breath is naturally waste lower


---------116:42----------
focus on the sensation in your arms and


---------116:47----------
let your attention balance between your


---------116:50----------
breath and your arms whichever one feels


---------116:53----------
bad


---------116:56----------
and let it sit with one for a while and


---------117:00----------
when it's ready to move let it move


---------117:08----------
move to something else if thoughts come


---------117:13----------
you can notice those thoughts that the


---------117:15----------
chess pieces come back let them come


---------117:17----------
back and then focus on the sensation in


---------117:19----------
your arms focus on the slowing your


---------117:25----------
breath will continue for about 30 cents


---------118:02----------
when you're ready go ahead and sit back


---------118:04----------
down open your eyes and tell me how you


---------118:08----------
feel that's good what what does that


---------118:12----------
mean um something weird happened it was


---------118:19----------
kind of like that's what we're here for


---------118:26----------
that means you did it right okay I just


---------118:33----------
since I was looking for thoughts when I


---------118:36----------
moved away from trying to look for a


---------118:39----------
feeling in my arms or or my chest


---------118:42----------
whatever I feel like a random random


---------118:45----------
like scenes would like pop my head and I


---------118:49----------
was just kind of like go along because I


---------118:52----------
knew that it was part of the process and


---------118:53----------
I would move back to my arms again and


---------118:56----------
then I would think Oh what I think about


---------118:58----------
last time and then something would pop


---------119:00----------
up who cares what I thought nothing


---------119:01----------
about this now


---------119:02----------
so some another scenery in my head or


---------119:04----------
another object or things going on and


---------119:06----------
then back my arms and then I kind of let


---------119:10----------
go I don't know I find I kind of felt


---------119:13----------
that yeah okay I just give I can i I


---------119:18----------
kind of give importance to those things


---------119:20----------
I'm thinking about or I'm looking for


---------119:22----------
whanau and not like some other [ __ ] good


---------119:26----------
so that's focusing of attention now let


---------119:29----------
me ask you what was your mind doing


---------119:31----------
while we were doing the breathing and


---------119:33----------
moving of the arms that was odd


---------119:42----------
why I'm like this but I always like


---------119:45----------
process images all the time I have like


---------119:48----------
visuals in my head like I thought about


---------119:51----------
that a lot today I think didn't I tell


---------119:53----------
about something I told you what I see


---------119:55----------
like I always thought like a drawing


---------119:58----------
almost or like something that displays


---------120:03----------
whatever whoever is going on and


---------120:05----------
whenever I do doing my arms up I


---------120:07----------
couldn't something about a robot should


---------120:10----------
not try to synchronize both right and I


---------120:13----------
can see like I could see like notches


---------120:15----------
right like 1 2 3 or almost like a clock


---------120:19----------
right and that's what I'm thinking about


---------120:21----------
the whole time I was like and I was but


---------120:23----------
what about the breathing though okay but


---------120:25----------
what are the notches actually I like


---------120:27----------
sink a boat and because I was having


---------120:29----------
those thoughts


---------120:30----------
I couldn't sink them beautiful okay so


---------120:33----------
let me explain something to you so


---------120:34----------
everyone thinks that meditation is about


---------120:36----------
stillness of the mind right so if we


---------120:40----------
think about it like you're you're saying


---------120:41----------
that anytime I try to steal my mind it


---------120:43----------
doesn't still I have all kinds of


---------120:44----------
thoughts and all kind of [ __ ] is


---------120:45----------
happening right okay good is this pen


---------120:49----------
still there's no yeah right so this is


---------120:54----------
hard for you to do with me okay you're


---------120:57----------
not gonna understand this inside


---------120:58----------
hopefully this will make sense for you


---------121:00----------
to meditate you can never do this you


---------121:02----------
can't just have something be still for


---------121:04----------
you to meditate you need to do this


---------121:13----------
we'll be able to do either okay what's


---------121:17----------
the difference between this and the


---------121:18----------
other thing or both of these pens still


---------121:23----------
they're both still but this one requires


---------121:25----------
like a effort to keep it still if you


---------121:27----------
like absolutely this is what you need


---------121:31----------
well not this this your mind is gonna


---------121:35----------
get [ __ ] bored and it's gonna think


---------121:37----------
about a thousand different things


---------121:38----------
okay people who try to teach you how to


---------121:40----------
meditate they taught you this you're


---------121:43----------
never going to be successful meditating


---------121:44----------
like that this is what you need okay and


---------121:48----------
then what you need to do is do it while


---------121:51----------
standing on one leg so your meditation


---------121:58----------
your stillness of the mind because the


---------122:00----------
pen is still in both ways people think


---------122:03----------
that meditation is stillness that comes


---------122:05----------
through no effort for you Felix it must


---------122:08----------
come through maximal effort yeah and if


---------122:11----------
you can fully engage your mind it's not


---------122:13----------
about stopping your mind it's about


---------122:15----------
pushing it to it's very limits and so I


---------122:19----------
think like that's that was the goal and


---------122:21----------
I think you were even doing it because


---------122:23----------
you were bouncing between focusing on


---------122:26----------
the breath and focusing on the robot you


---------122:29----------
see that huh and then even at the end I


---------122:31----------
told you bounce between the breath in


---------122:34----------
the sensation in your arms you must


---------122:37----------
bounce and you're like what does that


---------122:39----------
mean it's exactly what you were doing


---------122:41----------
before that's what I was telling you to


---------122:42----------
do bounce between the two your


---------122:44----------
meditation or your stillness is gonna


---------122:47----------
come through rhythm and balance not


---------122:49----------
through like sitting still it's still


---------122:53----------
still low right there's no movement it's


---------122:55----------
just a completely different thing it's


---------122:56----------
gonna come through balance and so you


---------122:58----------
need to bounce back and forth as much as


---------123:00----------
you can and and the the the cafeteria


---------123:03----------
exercise which we can't do now because


---------123:04----------
of Kovan that too is about bouncing


---------123:07----------
between as many things as you can as


---------123:09----------
quickly as you can and in between all


---------123:11----------
that you'll find stillness okay so okay


---------123:17----------
things like too fast cuz I have liked it


---------123:20----------
there isn't nope if it's too if there's


---------123:23----------
no such thing as too fast the only thing


---------123:25----------
that there is is not fast enough okay so


---------123:28----------
you need to push your mind until you are


---------123:32----------
exhausted okay because I remember


---------123:35----------
reeling back one time where I was like


---------123:37----------
um I was thinking about stuff right when


---------123:41----------
we're doing it and I was like wait if


---------123:45----------
that that's like unreasonable I'm going


---------123:46----------
too fast now I for some reason my mind


---------123:49----------
was just going faster and I was like


---------123:51----------
okay chill then you whatever you were


---------123:53----------
thinking about anybody have a little


---------123:54----------
more and then we'll go through the


---------123:55----------
breath so I have to know that then well


---------123:57----------
so what what we do want you to do is


---------123:59----------
return two things it's not about speed


---------124:02----------
it's about not returning okay right so


---------124:05----------
return to breath return to the sensation


---------124:07----------
let your mind go somewhere and bring it


---------124:09----------
back meditation for you should be about


---------124:12----------
anchor and balance not about stillness


---------124:16----------
okay okay yeah and in terms of a


---------124:20----------
technique you can try to do this


---------124:21----------
technique you can also try let me just


---------124:25----------
think I would literally say what you


---------124:27----------
should do is like you should do like


---------124:29----------
more martial arts oriented meditation I


---------124:31----------
think that'll work better for you so I'd


---------124:32----------
say like learn how to balance a pen or


---------124:36----------
learn and then once you get good at this


---------124:38----------
then do it on one foot so you should you


---------124:42----------
should be stable I'm gonna teach you


---------124:43----------
something


---------124:43----------
I forget what what pose this is and once


---------124:47----------
again IV I got a okay that's right no oh


---------124:50----------

---------124:52----------

---------124:53----------

---------124:55----------

---------124:57----------
sit continue sitting no problem okay


---------125:00----------
hold on okay so I want you to do I don't


---------125:04----------

---------125:06----------

---------126:05----------
what we want what about this open your


---------126:10----------

---------126:12----------

---------126:16----------
