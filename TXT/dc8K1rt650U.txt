---------00:00----------
and so what's your name friend William


---------00:03----------
William welcome we're thank you I


---------00:07----------
understand where you you had asked a


---------00:09----------
question on our AMA stream is that right


---------00:12----------
yeah and what was your question well I


---------00:17----------
have a lot of different questions though


---------00:19----------
but one of the ones are the one you have


---------00:22----------
in the title so can someone actually be


---------00:24----------
fully healed okay and I what did I say


---------00:29----------
back then I don't remember I was drunk


---------00:31----------
oh I did I didn't ask that question I


---------00:34----------
asked yeah I asked about more it's kind


---------00:40----------
of the same its it like I thought I had


---------00:44----------
gotten better it's a little bit what you


---------00:46----------
talked in a reckful stream where you


---------00:48----------
know where you think you get better but


---------00:52----------
after a while it hits you again


---------00:54----------
basically and and that's where I am at


---------00:58----------
basically yeah I thought I'd dealt with


---------01:01----------
by things but it turned back again and


---------01:05----------
stuff like that


---------01:06----------
okay so so when you when you say it


---------01:10----------
turns back or like so it sounds like you


---------01:12----------
made progress and then you start to slip


---------01:13----------
back yeah I thought it I thought I was


---------01:18----------
done with it like completely okay what's


---------01:21----------
my check psychologist also thought um


---------01:24----------
but but then like after two months it


---------01:27----------
came back again


---------01:28----------
and it wasn't so clear because um so


---------01:33----------
what I could do before was I could


---------01:36----------
actually listen to my emotion like why


---------01:37----------
am I feeling oh okay I'm getting these


---------01:39----------
kind of flashbacks was things like that


---------01:42----------
but this time it was more like a


---------01:44----------
constant noise or noise constant feeling


---------01:46----------
how I felt that dragged me down and I


---------01:50----------
couldn't really listen to a specific


---------01:51----------
thing if it makes any sense like it was


---------01:54----------
lasting for long periods let's just take


---------01:58----------
a step back volume so first I want to


---------02:00----------
ask you for a definition so when you say


---------02:02----------
can someone be fully healed right what


---------02:05----------
so let's start with your perception when


---------02:08----------
you're asking that question what do you


---------02:11----------
think fully healed looks like


---------02:14----------
um it to me it is more like you can take


---------02:23----------
it really without it affecting you okay


---------02:27----------
and and we'll get to what it is in a


---------02:30----------
second okay without it affecting you


---------02:33----------
okay


---------02:38----------
yeah maybe that's it okay I don't know


---------02:42----------
what else


---------02:42----------
okay yeah so then tell me can you tell


---------02:44----------
me a little bit about what you've


---------02:46----------
struggled with and then you know tell us


---------02:48----------
what you struggled with what got better


---------02:50----------
and then okay how you slipped back okay


---------02:55----------
um so I have yeah a very narcissistic


---------02:59----------
parent so can you tell us what well


---------03:04----------
means um I mean there's a lot to tell


---------03:09----------
but she it was just the world was


---------03:13----------
evolving just around her basically she


---------03:17----------
treated all only for her own benefits um


---------03:20----------
I mean


---------03:24----------
so I mean the reason why she even got us


---------03:29----------
kids born was to for her to be able to


---------03:31----------
stay in the country as well she didn't


---------03:34----------
won't really want to raise kids um help


---------03:37----------
me help me understand how you know that


---------03:39----------
oh she well she directly said it to me


---------03:42----------
when I confronted because I've always


---------03:47----------
yeah there's been a lot of questions


---------03:50----------
I've always tried to fit the puzzle


---------03:52----------
pieces together with all the information


---------03:54----------
I got him from you know my grin line


---------03:57----------
from how the pieces look like um well


---------04:02----------
there's so much to say but I wondered


---------04:06----------
how a person can behave like they can


---------04:09----------
like how can a person be or how did that


---------04:12----------
person become who that person is like


---------04:14----------
how is it possible so for instance my


---------04:17----------
grandma took care of me when I was


---------04:18----------
younger um the case yeah because my mom


---------04:22----------
wasn't there and my grandma was really


---------04:25----------
really nice person


---------04:26----------
so I didn't understand really why my mom


---------04:30----------
turned out the way she turned out to be


---------04:32----------
so like we don't really make sense for


---------04:34----------
me if it's okay with you here's what I'm


---------04:36----------
envisioning I'm envisioning that there


---------04:38----------
are people in our audience right now who


---------04:40----------
may have a narcissistic parent and don't


---------04:42----------
realize that that parent is narcissistic


---------04:44----------
okay so what I'd love for you to do if


---------04:46----------
you feel comfortable with it is yeah is


---------04:49----------
to tell us like give us an example of


---------04:51----------
something that your mom did or a couple


---------04:53----------
of the puzzle pieces when you were


---------04:54----------
asking how did she end up this way like


---------04:57----------
what did you see that made you start to


---------05:00----------
ask her did you ever want kids right


---------05:02----------
because that like well yeah so I mean


---------05:07----------
ever since I was born or as far as I


---------05:10----------
remember she told me that she hated me


---------05:12----------
and that I just take space in the world


---------05:14----------
and that I'm a total useless piece of


---------05:17----------
[ __ ] and she always put me into really


---------05:22----------
high demands like told me really high


---------05:25----------
things or okay yeah like she minified me


---------05:30----------
extremely much like I wouldn't past like


---------05:32----------
middle school and when I passed middle


---------05:34----------
school she told me I wouldn't pass high


---------05:36----------
school and one


---------05:37----------
I passed high school she would tell me


---------05:39----------
you know nothing really pleased her and


---------05:42----------
she would just yeah minify me always


---------05:46----------
like by these tasks like and I don't


---------05:51----------
know there's so much like I could never


---------05:54----------
walk beside her


---------05:55----------
I was actually always walking behind her


---------05:59----------
when we were out walking in town of


---------06:02----------
things like that


---------06:03----------
she had posters of herself and she in


---------06:07----------
the house which I actually yeah I didn't


---------06:10----------
think that much until my friends pointed


---------06:12----------
it out but also she always claimed like


---------06:17----------
the biggest groom I'm being very


---------06:21----------
analytical here because I'm a very


---------06:22----------
analytical person I said she oh yeah she


---------06:25----------
always claimed the biggest room when


---------06:27----------
when I compared to my friends and when I


---------06:29----------
was over at their places and stuff like


---------06:30----------
that they would sacrifice it for their


---------06:35----------
kids so they would take the smallest


---------06:37----------
room and give the biggest room to their


---------06:39----------
parents to their kids but my mom which


---------06:43----------
was like basically never at home took


---------06:46----------
the biggest her room she when we wanted


---------06:52----------
things or things like that if it did not


---------06:54----------
give her for any benefit if it was just


---------06:58----------
yeah what's a computer or a computer


---------07:01----------
game she would not really spend money


---------07:04----------
for that but if it if it was more for


---------07:06----------
her own benefit and status she would


---------07:08----------
help out like you know maybe getting


---------07:10----------
into better school or stuff like that


---------07:12----------
she would step up and do it so she could


---------07:15----------
brag more with her friends about how


---------07:17----------
amazing her kids were so for instance


---------07:19----------
when when I met her friends and they


---------07:24----------
asked asked me like oh who is this


---------07:27----------
little guy


---------07:28----------
it's very seldom that I even could


---------07:31----------
present myself it would usually be my


---------07:34----------
mom speaking for me and it would be so


---------07:36----------
little so it could be oh yeah that's my


---------07:39----------
youngest son he's eight years old or so


---------07:42----------
and then then she just goes immediately


---------07:44----------
to my brother which you know he's an A


---------07:48----------
student


---------07:49----------
he's actually a doctor as well my


---------07:53----------
condolences but yeah so it was always


---------07:59----------
drifting towards that immediately like


---------08:02----------
even when people asked me she would just


---------08:06----------
convert it directly to my brother and me


---------08:09----------
like oh but my his brother is a doctor


---------08:11----------
blah blah blah and his dude and you know


---------08:14----------
he's awesome ba ba ba and stuff like


---------08:16----------
that so what is there as a narcissistic


---------08:21----------
parent I don't know yeah that's that's


---------08:23----------
great guys come on thank you so much


---------08:24----------
yeah it's not great it's terrible what


---------08:26----------
you had to do yeah that's exact


---------08:29----------
you know when you say those kinds of


---------08:31----------
things I think it helps people


---------08:32----------
understand like that terminology and I


---------08:35----------
think it's good that it sounds like


---------08:36----------
you've been working with psychologists


---------08:38----------
so it's clear to me that your analytical


---------08:39----------
you know what you're talking about


---------08:41----------
you're pretty familiar with this stuff


---------08:43----------
there's something else I could add on it


---------08:46----------
as well that might be clarifies it is


---------08:47----------
they I don't know if it was like I guess


---------08:50----------
it's a little bit connected with like


---------08:52----------
sociopaths as well like they're very


---------08:54----------
good at playing with people's emotion


---------08:56----------
just for their own benefit and what do


---------08:58----------
you mean by mant mmm so my mother played


---------09:02----------
a lot of the victim card she was like oh


---------09:08----------
I'm yeah I don't know how much


---------09:12----------
go into details but basically she was


---------09:14----------
like oh yeah it's poor me I'm single mom


---------09:18----------
raising YouTube kids but literally it


---------09:21----------
was her choice doing it and she's done a


---------09:23----------
lot of really really crazy things behind


---------09:26----------
the scenes I'm probably not gonna go


---------09:28----------
okay shouldn't sit here I think yeah


---------09:30----------
yeah okay but yeah yeah I'm glad you


---------09:37----------
feel comfortable sort of saying yeah I'm


---------09:39----------
not gonna I don't feel comfortable


---------09:40----------
talking about that that's very important


---------09:42----------
I I am quite comfortable talking with it


---------09:44----------
I just yeah I think it doesn't fit so


---------09:50----------
much I don't know like hmm it's a little


---------09:55----------
bit more yeah I'll just stop myself


---------10:00----------
there I think it's true yeah so we'll


---------10:03----------
just one one point about that I want you


---------10:05----------
to feel very comfortable not talking


---------10:11----------
about something that you don't want to


---------10:13----------
talk about yeah


---------10:14----------
but generally speaking if your thought


---------10:17----------
is that it's not relevant then I would


---------10:21----------
question that because I think oh the


---------10:23----------
whole point of these conversations is


---------10:25----------
that when people give me raw data


---------10:27----------
instead of their analysis I tend to be


---------10:30----------
able to help them more because if I get


---------10:32----------
your analysis I'm dealing with your


---------10:35----------
biases and I can't form my own lecture


---------10:37----------
so I'm not trying to pressure you into


---------10:39----------
saying it I want to be very clear about


---------10:40----------
that but and we don't have to talk about


---------10:42----------
now I point to cell I can talk about why


---------10:45----------
I'm restricting myself a little bit let


---------10:47----------
me just sure change battery on my


---------10:49----------
headset just one second here okay can I


---------10:56----------
hear yeah I


---------10:58----------
I think okay it's because of the well


---------11:05----------
work-related I have probation and I'm


---------11:07----------
that's why I'm thinking okay a little


---------11:10----------
bit let's just steer clear let's not


---------11:11----------
even take a chance can you tell me about


---------11:13----------
your older brother you have one sibling


---------11:16----------
yeah just one sibling yeah can you tell


---------11:18----------
me about him uh well he's a doctor okay


---------11:22----------
five years older than me okay probably


---------11:25----------
the kindest brother I could ever wish


---------11:27----------
for


---------11:27----------
really but yes but he I think he never


---------11:31----------
ever really understood how I felt I


---------11:33----------
thought he did at one point when he


---------11:36----------
called me one time and said dude oh so


---------11:42----------
what was happening was I moved out and


---------11:44----------
what happened was my mom started


---------11:47----------
projecting it towards my brother which


---------11:49----------
has never ever happened before I was


---------11:51----------
always the one taking it yeah all the


---------11:56----------
shits that she had to project or so


---------11:59----------
which I guess cuz I'm smaller and it's


---------12:02----------
easier and she portrayed in me as the


---------12:04----------
bad person cuz I never lived up to her


---------12:07----------
demands and stuff like that but yeah so


---------12:14----------
when I moved out he was calling me and


---------12:17----------
he was like [ __ ] dude I'm sorry I didn't


---------12:20----------
know he was this much like I've been


---------12:22----------
just experiencing this for two three


---------12:25----------
days and I can't imagine you've been


---------12:27----------
living this through your entire life


---------12:32----------
yeah how does it feel to say that well


---------12:36----------
what are you feeling right now um I felt


---------12:40----------
that he understood at that point what


---------12:42----------
even now I don't know like as you say


---------12:44----------
those words yeah I can't steal it I can


---------12:47----------
still I can still feel how I felt back


---------12:52----------
then and well are not feeling tell us


---------12:54----------
about that


---------12:54----------
Oh


---------13:00----------
[Music]


---------13:02----------
why am I here


---------13:05----------
what are you it's it's like what am I


---------13:13----------
doing here why am I here why am i


---------13:17----------
existing even like it yeah


---------13:23----------
so let me know so when your brother


---------13:25----------
called you and told you that I can't


---------13:29----------
believe you've been doing this with this


---------13:30----------
your entire life I've just been doing it


---------13:32----------
with two or three days the way then you


---------13:34----------
felt was why am I here


---------13:36----------
no no oh oh you mean at that point sorry


---------13:39----------
sorry I thought you meant what the


---------13:41----------
feelings of of those feelings were sorry


---------13:44----------
yeah what that feeling was I felt like


---------13:47----------
oh [ __ ] finally my brother and


---------13:49----------
understands me


---------13:50----------
um because I don't know yeah you can


---------13:56----------
stop me also at whenever you want um cuz


---------13:58----------
I don't have her own stuff but first


---------14:02----------
time I mean I had suicidal thoughts


---------14:05----------
already when I was like around 8:00 and


---------14:08----------
I was really really considering like hey


---------14:12----------
yeah I don't know I shouldn't yeah I


---------14:15----------
should have been dead I guess when I was


---------14:17----------
like 12


---------14:18----------
well I mean the day after in debt when


---------14:20----------
you were well like yeah I tried to jump


---------14:25----------
off a cliff but in the end I got


---------14:26----------
flashbacks from my grandmother which is


---------14:28----------
the one and the main reason why I'm


---------14:30----------
still alive I guess but I somehow


---------14:32----------
managed to lunch myself back to safety


---------14:35----------
again I was literally outside another


---------14:38----------
cliff and I I talked to my brother the


---------14:41----------
day after I was like yeah I was supposed


---------14:44----------
to be dead yesterday and stuff like that


---------14:46----------
um What did he say


---------14:49----------
so I don't remember


---------14:53----------
too much cuz it's like because I talked


---------14:56----------
a lot with my brother about the past and


---------14:58----------
stuff like that as well and and we both


---------15:00----------
have like kind of no memories of her


---------15:02----------
childhood like till were 15 or something


---------15:04----------
like that but from what I think and from


---------15:07----------
all right I do believe and I remember is


---------15:09----------
that um yeah he was like oh oh [ __ ] cuz


---------15:13----------
he hasn't been really that good with


---------15:14----------
talking with emotions sure um and I


---------15:19----------
don't know how much he actually


---------15:20----------
remembers cuz I told him like a year ago


---------15:23----------
I was like did I'm feeling so bad I'm


---------15:27----------
really at a bad point and he was like oh


---------15:29----------
it's just D vitamin so it's uh I don't


---------15:34----------
know if it's some doctor thing or if


---------15:36----------
it's uh yeah I don't know but yeah so


---------15:41----------
can I ask you do you so can you tell us


---------15:44----------
a little bit about like pulling yourself


---------15:46----------
back from the cliff why did you do that


---------15:47----------
I got flashbacks from my grandmother


---------15:52----------
that she would be crying so much and it


---------15:54----------
would be very egoistic to do it um


---------15:58----------
actually anybody was just a flashback of


---------16:00----------
my grandmother crying see and I managed


---------16:06----------
to somehow launch myself back to safety


---------16:09----------
do you regret not jumping


---------16:16----------
I don't know good answer


---------16:20----------
I'm glad you didn't jump yeah but I


---------16:25----------
think it's okay to not know mm-hm right


---------16:29----------
whether you made the right choice there


---------16:31----------
or not is your grandmother's still alive


---------16:33----------
she is


---------16:35----------
what's your yeah how's she doing


---------16:38----------
uh-huh pretty bad right now


---------16:41----------
um which has also been a very major


---------16:44----------
point on on how it's affected me how


---------16:49----------
long has she been pretty bad


---------16:52----------
well I


---------16:53----------
the reason why she couldn't take of care


---------16:55----------
of me anymore when I was 8 years old


---------16:57----------
onwards she was in an accident and after


---------17:02----------
that she just got bad all the way was


---------17:05----------
better than me


---------17:06----------
mmm he'd never she she had problem


---------17:10----------
walking and stuff like that and it just


---------17:14----------
got worse and worse and yeah and I I got


---------17:20----------
after a while when I kept like I kept


---------17:24----------
visiting her right and she got yeah bad


---------17:30----------
also in the memory and thought wise so


---------17:33----------
she confused me with my brother even


---------17:35----------
with my uncle and stuff like that so I


---------17:37----------
felt like I wasn't really meeting my


---------17:39----------
grandma anymore like she was funny -


---------17:41----------
yeah fade away how long has that been


---------17:44----------
going on


---------17:51----------
two years two years out when her oh the


---------17:57----------
accident or her memory part of her


---------17:59----------
memory uh two years ish okay two to


---------18:03----------
three years and I I got so much guilt it


---------18:07----------
takes me it takes me a while to get


---------18:09----------
there even to visit her cuz it's another


---------18:11----------
city and even when I visit her the


---------18:17----------
feeling is also not right cuz yeah she's


---------18:20----------
just so confused and stuff like that


---------18:22----------
sure so I decided to and which was so


---------18:25----------
hard for me to do but I decided to try


---------18:29----------
to work with myself and cuz I I could


---------18:34----------
barely even visit her as well because I


---------18:35----------
was at a pretty bad condition but that


---------18:37----------
led me to feeling even more guilt


---------18:39----------
because I didn't visit her on top of


---------18:41----------
that so it was like just a bad Luke on


---------18:44----------
top of that with everything else I had


---------18:47----------
you felt like you were abandoning her


---------18:51----------
yeah I felt like the only one that I


---------18:59----------
could trust in this world yeah


---------19:05----------
you felt like the only one you could


---------19:07----------
trust in this world was heard so what


---------19:10----------
would you feel by when you sort of


---------19:13----------
decided to work on yourself no I knew


---------19:17----------
high I had I knew I had to twist yeah


---------19:20----------
what are you feeling right now well it's


---------19:26----------
uh yeah I don't know it's it's just


---------19:34----------
that's yeah I don't know maybe I feeling


---------19:40----------
I will never


---------19:41----------
get again basically well yeah yeah I'm


---------19:52----------
imagining that you're kind of just


---------19:54----------
remembering you know how much she meant


---------19:56----------
to you and that yeah I think she was the


---------20:00----------
only one that made me human to be honest


---------20:03----------
um yeah or somewhat human but yeah


---------20:14----------
William do you feel alone for sure for


---------20:21----------
sure is that the main is that that I'm


---------20:27----------
not part of it I don't think so I've


---------20:32----------
there's so many other parts on it I've


---------20:34----------
been thinking about it too if it is but


---------20:41----------
I think like even if so I can even be


---------20:44----------
with friends and stuff like that and and


---------20:47----------
still feel lonely um it's just that I


---------20:51----------
don't think I think there's so much more


---------20:54----------
into it tell us well I think I mean when


---------21:01----------
I've been in a relationship I know what


---------21:03----------
happiness can be I don't have to fake it


---------21:05----------
um I know how the world should be when


---------21:10----------
you're a functional human so I'm touched


---------21:15----------
upon that part and mmm you know it's


---------21:18----------
possible yeah but I think it was through


---------21:22----------
distraction that I reached it as a


---------21:24----------
relationship I I think yeah the dealt


---------21:27----------
with all my problems when I met the peak


---------21:29----------
like it when I'm feeling good yeah how


---------21:33----------
do you feel we know it like that when


---------21:37----------
I'm feeling bad I don't have motivation


---------21:41----------
I I have so many different kind of bad


---------21:44----------
periods sure so it depends on which one


---------21:48----------
you mean so let's start by tell us the


---------21:51----------
different kinds of bad okay excellent


---------21:53----------
point on your part um yeah I mean I


---------21:58----------
guess that's already one of them when


---------22:02----------
I've been already telling me since my


---------22:03----------
childhood basically and yeah that was i


---------22:08----------
I didn't understand why what function I


---------22:11----------
even had to why I was existing because


---------22:14----------
what I just heard from my mom was that


---------22:16----------
she hates me and that I just take place


---------22:18----------
in the world and and uh that she doesn't


---------22:21----------
even want me and so I took


---------22:27----------
the routes I yeah I what struck me a lot


---------22:35----------
was like when my friend told me likes


---------22:36----------
dude who's live are you actually living


---------22:38----------
for


---------22:39----------
it's not even your life and I'm like


---------22:40----------
what do you mean and then that's kind of


---------22:43----------
first time I opened up I was like living


---------22:47----------
the life to try to pleasure my mom


---------22:50----------
basically were to meet up her demands


---------22:52----------
which was never met anyways


---------22:54----------
been crazy how like how crazy is that


---------22:59----------
she really could never say thank you or


---------23:02----------
you know have never even heard her say I


---------23:04----------
love your stuff like that that was


---------23:06----------
totally out of the dictionary it's more


---------23:08----------
like when she told me to do things


---------23:10----------
it was always never good enough no


---------23:12----------
matter what I did like if I vacuumed the


---------23:15----------
house and I she came home and saw it she


---------23:20----------
would scream at me and also say the way


---------23:23----------
like you have not vacuum clean right as


---------23:26----------
in intending that I haven't done it very


---------23:29----------
much even still s even though I might


---------23:31----------
have still done it in the house


---------23:35----------
oh 10 yeah I don't know firely I I did a


---------23:41----------
lot I did shopping I helped her helped


---------23:46----------
her doing washing clothes I yeah there's


---------23:50----------
a lot of things but she have yeah two


---------23:54----------
older no she's the oldest hmm did she


---------24:01----------
have to help a lot around the house I


---------24:06----------
know how much from the story from what I


---------24:09----------
understand I'm not really sure I haven't


---------24:11----------
asked too much about it and I don't


---------24:14----------
remember who told me it but he might be


---------24:16----------
from her so it might be very false or I


---------24:19----------
take everything she says there with a


---------24:22----------
very grain of salt I can't really trust


---------24:24----------
my mother so I don't really if it's for


---------24:26----------
my mother then which I think it is she


---------24:29----------
said that she took care of her siblings


---------24:31----------
because parents were yeah out and stuff


---------24:34----------
like my my grandpa was a prison and my


---------24:37----------
grandma had to take care of her or


---------24:39----------
something like that


---------24:44----------
oddly enough I I don't know if she's


---------24:46----------
mistaken there wait she may she may be


---------24:52----------
right that she took care of her siblings


---------24:54----------
and we'll get to that and said okay yeah


---------24:56----------
okay yeah yeah oh yeah different kind of


---------25:01----------
beds sorry uh I trailed off a little bit


---------25:03----------
yeah so that would be like yeah I took


---------25:05----------
detours oh yeah and she she made me do a


---------25:10----------
lot of things that I okay so this kind


---------25:15----------
of paths I'm trailing off a little bit


---------25:17----------
too much here I see I'm just gonna try


---------25:19----------
to talk about the bad the bachelor boy


---------25:22----------
yeah


---------25:23----------
you're doing fine bro okay yeah so the


---------25:26----------
bats were like you're doing actually


---------25:29----------
really well thank you it's I tried to


---------25:37----------
always when I was younger I tried to


---------25:39----------
always make my mom happier so the


---------25:46----------
punishment would be less yeah verbally


---------25:48----------
and stuff like that so I always when I


---------25:54----------
came home


---------25:55----------
look if they were her shoes inside so I


---------25:57----------
could prepare what kind of state I could


---------26:00----------
be and I came here by our footsteps


---------26:04----------
before like if I were to play computer


---------26:06----------
games


---------26:07----------
I had study materials next to me so I


---------26:11----------
would like shut off the screen and put


---------26:12----------
it in front of me just to make her not


---------26:16----------
rage as much as she would towards me


---------26:18----------
just to prevent as much as I could and


---------26:21----------
you know try to even flatter her by some


---------26:25----------
complements and stuff like that but so


---------26:30----------
yeah


---------26:36----------
that kind of bad is like I tried to do


---------26:39----------
something I kind of diss not really I


---------26:42----------
didn't really discussed it at that time


---------26:45----------
but like I had to live through it and


---------26:47----------
and still still feel bad about it in


---------26:51----------
that punishment and then there is a


---------27:00----------
later on before I even talked a lot


---------27:03----------
about this and managed this


---------27:04----------
I had the different kind of bad as in


---------27:10----------
everything was extremely heavy um no


---------27:15----------
matter what I did you mean like physical


---------27:19----------
heaviness mmm and mentally especially


---------27:24----------
like you felt like your body was heavy


---------27:26----------
yeah


---------27:28----------
everything I did you described it really


---------27:30----------
good when you say debuff it really is a


---------27:33----------
big debuff yeah cuz and it effects on


---------27:35----------
everything so how about at that that


---------27:43----------
time of debuff last like the heaviness


---------27:47----------
that one yeah


---------27:56----------
um because it's been in periods and


---------27:59----------
stuff like that


---------28:00----------
I felt it mostly when I broke up with my


---------28:02----------
girlfriend so that one lasted for I


---------28:05----------
would say two two years but before that


---------28:08----------
I had gone through it for a very long


---------28:11----------
time but I think like I was living with


---------28:13----------
it so like my my thoughts were when I


---------28:16----------
broke up when my girlfriend again was


---------28:18----------
like holy [ __ ] has it been this bad


---------28:22----------
maybe I cuz I wasn't quite a long time


---------28:25----------
relationship so I think I faded it out


---------28:28----------
for like five and a half years and I'm


---------28:35----------
29


---------28:37----------
okay yep so yeah I I think I didn't


---------28:44----------
really remember but there's actually a


---------28:45----------
lot of things there that I could also


---------28:47----------
mention actually in that period too but


---------28:52----------
yeah I I didn't understand how heavily


---------28:57----------
I've been through it every day because I


---------28:59----------
think I got used to it so much at that


---------29:01----------
time even though I still know it's been


---------29:04----------
really shitty like I even wrote a diary


---------29:05----------
how often my mom would scream at my ear


---------29:08----------
and telling me how useless I am and


---------29:10----------
stuff like that even when I was begging


---------29:12----------
or banging my head against the wall and


---------29:14----------
screaming for her to stop she would


---------29:16----------
still continue to do that so I brought


---------29:18----------
that diary how many times she does it at


---------29:22----------
my probably worst period and I stopped


---------29:25----------
after like a week when I realized she


---------29:27----------
did it on an average one to one and a


---------29:30----------
half hour per day just screaming at


---------29:33----------
these things and stuff like that but


---------29:37----------
yeah sorry I lost all


---------29:44----------
what I was that that's a that you don't


---------29:46----------
I think you're doing a really remarkable


---------29:48----------
job of trying to keep track of the


---------29:50----------
conversation you don't actually need to


---------29:52----------
keep track of it so much I'm keeping


---------29:54----------
track yeah


---------29:55----------
can I ask you a couple of other so first


---------29:58----------
of all dude it sounds like you've been


---------29:59----------
through like just you just have a really


---------30:02----------
shitty life yeah for sure yeah I cannot


---------30:07----------
imagine having your mom you know like be


---------30:09----------
banging your head against a wall


---------30:11----------
signaling to her in every way that you


---------30:14----------
know how that you were distressed and


---------30:16----------
that you were hurting and that she


---------30:18----------
doesn't give a [ __ ] and just keeps


---------30:20----------
hurting to be honest I think she was


---------30:23----------
actually enjoying it even more there's a


---------30:26----------
lot of things I've tried I mean I


---------30:28----------
started even ignoring her I tried to


---------30:31----------
ignore technique because yeah I remember


---------30:35----------
I talked to my grandma I said dude I


---------30:37----------
think I can't I can't last anymore like


---------30:40----------
I'm so broken and I'm quite young when


---------30:42----------
I'm saying this I was like yeah cuz I


---------30:46----------
was thinking about moving out already


---------30:47----------
when I was like yeah 11 12 ish and well


---------30:54----------
that's when I started ignoring her for


---------30:57----------
one and a half year as well I tried so


---------30:58----------
many different techniques just to try to


---------31:00----------
see what works and what you know so even


---------31:03----------
when we were living in the same roof I


---------31:05----------
ignored what happens to someone who


---------31:07----------
tries a lot of techniques and none of


---------31:09----------
them work well that that's my other dark


---------31:15----------
side so the first yeah these first


---------31:18----------
thought that I'm talking about like even


---------31:20----------
though it still felt so had been stuff


---------31:22----------
like that I still felt like I knew or I


---------31:24----------
knew I had possibilities to actually


---------31:27----------
work with methods that would help me


---------31:29----------
like I tried to discover a lot by myself


---------31:32----------
how to improve and stuff like that I


---------31:34----------
were visiting the psychologist and


---------31:36----------
things like that so I still kind of felt


---------31:39----------
hope but especially when I beat me again


---------31:43----------
down to these bad loops and especially


---------31:49----------
when it went longer and longer I felt


---------31:52----------
more and more hopeless like oh [ __ ]


---------31:55----------
maybe there is no way to go like I've


---------31:59----------
done everything by the textbook above


---------32:01----------
yeah I had so many things so that's my


---------32:04----------
second bed where I start to feel because


---------32:07----------
now I don't feel as heavy as before


---------32:09----------
definitely not but there has been


---------32:13----------
periods yeah but they're not as heavy as


---------32:18----------
before definitely not before I could


---------32:19----------
think how yeah suicidal thoughts like


---------32:22----------
four five times per day but now it's


---------32:26----------
it's more yeah the the way of it's


---------32:31----------
hopeless and I'm I'm not yeah getting


---------32:36----------
anywhere I've tried a lot yeah so I'm


---------32:38----------
actually a little bit surprised that you


---------32:40----------
you're still alive


---------32:42----------
does that yeah no no no no I I actually


---------32:46----------
say that to everyone I meet that I share


---------32:48----------
this story like I don't know why I'm


---------32:50----------
still alive that's that's how I'm saying


---------32:51----------
I'm I literally don't know why I'm still


---------32:53----------
alive and that's why I don't want to


---------32:55----------
promise anyone as well when it comes to


---------32:57----------
them saying like yeah but yeah that's


---------32:59----------
enough yeah yeah I get you


---------33:02----------
so we're gonna think about I'm gonna


---------33:05----------
just can I collect my thoughts for a


---------33:07----------
moment yep


---------33:34----------
so let me start with this William I feel


---------33:37----------
like I've asked you two percent of the


---------33:39----------
questions that I want to ask and I


---------33:41----------
understand two percent of what I want to


---------33:44----------
understand about you okay and at the


---------33:48----------
same time I feel like I you know people


---------33:50----------
come on here for answers and so we have


---------33:54----------
to take a step back and acknowledge that


---------33:56----------
the answers are I'm you know I don't


---------33:58----------
really have answers but the thoughts


---------33:59----------
that I have for you aren't gonna be


---------34:02----------
accurate because I really don't know you


---------34:04----------
know we've just scratched the surface of


---------34:06----------
we yeah yeah at the same time you know I


---------34:09----------
want to share with you something that a


---------34:10----------
patient of mine who had tried to commit


---------34:12----------
suicide several times you know and one


---------34:16----------
day I asked him because he feels a lot


---------34:18----------
the same way you do and so I was like


---------34:20----------
you know so it sounds like you don't


---------34:21----------
really have any like reason to live like


---------34:23----------
what you know you don't have hope which


---------34:26----------
is fair because if you don't have any


---------34:29----------
reason to hope all right cuz like we


---------34:31----------
just tell people like oh just like keep


---------34:33----------
hope and keep hoping I think people who


---------34:35----------
say that don't really understand what


---------34:36----------
yes the lives of the people that they're


---------34:39----------
talking to have been like I cannot you


---------34:43----------
know to be an eight-year-old child and


---------34:45----------
yelling at your mom to stop and banging


---------34:47----------
your head against a wall because what


---------34:48----------
she's saying is hurting you and for her


---------34:50----------
to continue yelling at you for like 60


---------34:53----------
minutes or 90 minutes is just like why


---------34:57----------
the [ __ ]


---------34:57----------
and then like how many days can an


---------35:01----------
eight-year-old hold on to hope with that


---------35:04----------
happening how many years can you hold on


---------35:08----------
like you know at some point the hope


---------35:11----------
runs out and I get that I don't think


---------35:16----------
it's reasonable for you to hope and also


---------35:20----------
I want you to hope and I hope that I can


---------35:23----------
help you hope a little bit and if I


---------35:26----------
can't that's okay too because I don't


---------35:28----------
think it's my place to believe that I


---------35:31----------
can get you to hope does that make sense


---------35:33----------
like I'm gonna give it a shot but if you


---------35:36----------
choose not to hope at the end of this


---------35:37----------
conversation like that's totally cool


---------35:39----------
man and like I have no problem with that


---------35:41----------
mmm I'll be saying head but at the same


---------35:44----------
time like I won't blame you for it right


---------35:46----------
cuz like why the [ __ ] would you hope


---------35:47----------
like you


---------35:48----------
doing this for 29 years and you know it


---------35:50----------
sounds like whenever you start to claw


---------35:52----------
your way forward something just pulls


---------35:54----------
you back and what's pulling you back I


---------35:56----------
mean you know I almost get the sense


---------35:58----------
that you're swimming in the ocean and


---------36:01----------
you have a cannonball attached to your


---------36:03----------
legs and you can work really really


---------36:05----------
really hard to swim to the surface and


---------36:08----------
get a breath of fresh air and then


---------36:10----------
you're kind of like put like you're not


---------36:11----------
pulling the cannonball up but like any


---------36:13----------
time you start to slack a little bit


---------36:15----------
that cannonball is there just drags you


---------36:17----------
down and I don't see a point and you


---------36:20----------
continuing to try to swim to the surface


---------36:22----------
if you can't ever get rid of a


---------36:24----------
cannonball like that's just no way to


---------36:25----------
win life like live life yeah so the


---------36:30----------
question is why do you live and I don't


---------36:33----------
mean that I'll give you the good answer


---------36:35----------
yeah right and I don't mean like like I


---------36:38----------
don't mean that in the philosophical


---------36:40----------
sense no I get you though because I've


---------36:43----------
been thinking about that extremely much


---------36:45----------
as well one of them is I try to not be


---------36:47----------
to be egoistic or maybe that's the main


---------36:52----------
reason but that also runs out after a


---------36:55----------
while but yeah basically like even


---------36:59----------
though what I feel as I feel I know


---------37:03----------
logically like for instance my brother


---------37:05----------
would be devastated and before that like


---------37:11----------
when my grandma went and then I don't


---------37:14----------
think you get it


---------37:15----------
hold on okay that stuff is fine I mean


---------37:18----------
like literally like wire like so I'm not


---------37:20----------
saying okay so let me tell you what this


---------37:23----------
patient told me okay okay so he's like


---------37:25----------
you know he tried to kill himself a


---------37:26----------
bunch of times and and so like I was


---------37:30----------
like why don't you kill yourself like


---------37:31----------
you know why are you no longer suicide


---------37:34----------
ladies like he had suicidal thoughts but


---------37:36----------
he wasn't intending on killing himself


---------37:37----------
and then I asked him you know why is


---------37:40----------
that he's like well you know after the


---------37:41----------
third or fourth time I realized that as


---------37:45----------
much as I wanted to kill myself and I


---------37:48----------
would try to kill myself my body


---------37:50----------
wouldn't let me hmm so literally the


---------37:53----------
reason he's alive is not because he has


---------37:55----------
a reason to live but because there's


---------37:57----------
literally a force literally on his body


---------38:01----------
keeps him from killing himself mm-hmm


---------38:04----------
and that there was something inside you


---------38:06----------
that wants to live more than you want to


---------38:09----------
die right that is the reason I think


---------38:12----------
you're alive and yeah I didn't recognize


---------38:15----------
with that as well


---------38:16----------
yeah and it's [ __ ] weird because you


---------38:18----------
want to die but there's something inside


---------38:21----------
you that's like no man we're not gonna


---------38:23----------
do that


---------38:24----------
hmm right and in his case like he was


---------38:28----------
like he literally realized that he was


---------38:31----------
trying to kill his body so there was


---------38:34----------
some part of his being that was like


---------38:36----------
putting pills into his mouth and trying


---------38:39----------
to kill himself and there was another


---------38:41----------
part of his body that was like this is


---------38:43----------
bad for me I don't want this and he


---------38:44----------
would vomit and so one thing and I don't


---------38:49----------
mean this in sort of a philosophical or


---------38:50----------
psychological sense I mean like


---------38:52----------
literally if we look at it


---------38:53----------
scientifically there is something within


---------38:55----------
you that is striving for life and that's


---------38:59----------
the only if we really look at it


---------39:01----------
scientifically with everything all the


---------39:02----------
[ __ ] that you've been through if you


---------39:05----------
haven't killed yourself the reasons to


---------39:07----------
kill yourself are like let's give it a


---------39:09----------
score of a thousand and if you haven't


---------39:14----------
died that means that there's something


---------39:15----------
inside you that is worth 1,001 fighting


---------39:18----------
against that what can we just


---------39:21----------
acknowledge that for a moment like does


---------39:24----------
that make sense yeah and and so I think


---------39:27----------
your way forward isn't understanding


---------39:29----------
like what the [ __ ] is that right because


---------39:34----------
if we can try it like and I think you


---------39:36----------
can talk about all of the things that


---------39:38----------
are bad in your life and the different


---------39:39----------
kinds of bad you experience fantastic I


---------39:42----------
think each of those are particular D


---------39:43----------
buffs that you need to cleanse before


---------39:46----------
you get healed and I do think that you


---------39:48----------
can get healed and the reason that I


---------39:49----------
think you can get healed is very its


---------39:50----------
scientific it's not hope it's not


---------39:53----------
philosophical it's not even


---------39:54----------
psychological it's just that I see a guy


---------39:57----------
who has something within his whole being


---------40:00----------
of a person that wants to live more than


---------40:03----------
you want to die and I just don't think


---------40:05----------
you understand what that is and I think


---------40:08----------
you've lived your whole life being


---------40:10----------
confused about that thing but as you


---------40:13----------
begin to understand it you'll


---------40:15----------
actually find hope but it's not gonna


---------40:21----------
come from like me telling you that life


---------40:23----------
is you know worth living which I do


---------40:25----------
think it is and I do think you should


---------40:26----------
continue to live I'm glad you're alive


---------40:28----------
and I do have hope for you I think you


---------40:31----------
can be fully healed let me just say all


---------40:33----------
those things good I really do we have


---------40:34----------
that and yeah I mean yeah I I think then


---------40:39----------
too I think it comes from it starts with


---------40:42----------
the exploration of like live and I think


---------40:44----------
you're in the right spot like you're


---------40:46----------
like you know why am I here


---------40:48----------
and it's not a rhetorical question that


---------40:51----------
doesn't mean I don't have any reason to


---------40:53----------
live although that could be true but the


---------40:56----------
question is if you have no reason to


---------40:58----------
live and yet you continue to exist and


---------41:00----------
you have no reason to be there there has


---------41:03----------
to be a reason why you're here and


---------41:05----------
finding that thing is gonna be the start


---------41:07----------
of your journey right so like we have to


---------41:10----------
accept as a fact that you are here yeah


---------41:14----------
and that like this is the other thing


---------41:16----------
now we get philosophical because I think


---------41:17----------
like there's order in the universe like


---------41:19----------
I think things happen for a reason and I


---------41:21----------
don't mean that in terms of like a


---------41:23----------
divine reason I mean like literally if I


---------41:26----------
hold this pen and I let go it's gonna


---------41:28----------
fall


---------41:28----------
it fell for a reason like like if there


---------41:32----------
if there's rain that means that they're


---------41:34----------
gonna be clouds right that there's like


---------41:36----------
order and rhythm to the universe and


---------41:39----------
that if you're alive like I don't think


---------41:40----------
that order in the universe breaks down


---------41:44----------
at some arbitrary point which is what a


---------41:46----------
lot of people who claimed to be


---------41:47----------
scientific believed right so they sort


---------41:50----------
of say that lay out there's like an


---------41:51----------
order to clouds and rain and stuff but


---------41:53----------
there's not an order to life they just


---------41:56----------
sort of draw this arbitrary dividing


---------41:57----------
line which in my mind let me know if I'm


---------41:59----------
losing you or if this is getting


---------42:00----------
abstract you fall um I think so yeah


---------42:05----------
okay anyway so I think that there's a


---------42:08----------
there's a reason that you're alive yeah


---------42:12----------
and I think we have to explore kind of


---------42:14----------
what that is the second thing is in


---------42:17----------
terms of your question of can you be


---------42:19----------
healed


---------42:20----------
I've only they're fully healed yeah I


---------42:23----------
think so although maybe not let me


---------42:29----------
about that for a second I think you can


---------42:40----------
be healed enough to where you can no


---------42:43----------
longer want to die and you will cling on


---------42:46----------
to life I do believe you can be fully


---------42:51----------
healed as well but as a clinician and


---------42:54----------
the scientist I can't put my money on


---------42:57----------
fully healed but I do feel comfortable


---------42:59----------
putting my money on healed enough yeah


---------43:03----------
so if you would put a percentage on it


---------43:04----------
how much would it be so to say 80% okay


---------43:10----------
yeah that's cool yeah I was guessing


---------43:12----------
around eighty ninety two myself


---------43:13----------
yeah I'm nine he's a little bit


---------43:16----------
optimistic like I believe it's possible


---------43:18----------
sure but I'd put my money on eighty yeah


---------43:21----------
okay and here's and I want to hear a


---------43:23----------
little bit more about like you know your


---------43:25----------
backslide and when you started feeling


---------43:26----------
better and stuff but even before we go


---------43:28----------
there I'll share a couple of thoughts if


---------43:29----------
that's okay with you


---------43:30----------
do you want to jump in and say anything


---------43:31----------
or ask questions by the way no I'm fine


---------43:34----------
okay so I'm gonna share with you a


---------43:36----------
couple of thoughts and then I want to


---------43:37----------
ask you a little bit about how you


---------43:39----------
started to feel better and now how you


---------43:40----------
feel worse okay so I think the problem


---------43:43----------
with getting fully healed is that like


---------43:45----------
you think about getting fully healed is


---------43:47----------
like 80% but it's not really 80% it's


---------43:50----------
like like sorry did you ever play


---------43:52----------
fallout no okay


---------43:55----------
so in fallout you have like different


---------43:57----------
body parts and you can like target and


---------44:00----------
damage different body parts right and


---------44:03----------
then like depending on what you damage


---------44:04----------
you like lose some ability like if


---------44:07----------
someone like wounds your leg then your


---------44:09----------
movement speed is reduced if they wound


---------44:11----------
your arm you can't shoot things you know


---------44:13----------
and so I think when we talk about a


---------44:15----------
hundred percent I don't know if you can


---------44:17----------
get a hundred percent but I think you


---------44:18----------
can like heal your leg and like have the


---------44:21----------
movement debuff gone hmm and so so I


---------44:23----------
think it's actually in a weird way


---------44:25----------
optimistic that you have a lot of


---------44:26----------
different kinds of bad because if it was


---------44:29----------
just one blob of bad like I don't know


---------44:32----------
what to do about that but the feeling of


---------44:35----------
loneliness is like a particular thing


---------44:39----------
that I think you can improve the feeling


---------44:41----------
of motivation


---------44:42----------
I think it's a particularly of


---------44:46----------
hopelessness I think is a particularly


---------44:50----------
being extremely heavy which hits you for


---------44:53----------
two years at a time is a particular


---------44:55----------
thing which you can improve and I think


---------44:57----------
all of these things are maybe related in


---------44:59----------
some way but I think they're discrete


---------45:01----------
things so for example your feeling of


---------45:05----------
extreme heaviness sounds to me like


---------45:06----------
clinical depression it sounds like you


---------45:09----------
suffer for something called neuro


---------45:11----------
vegetative depression and the cool thing


---------45:13----------
is that we have good scientific evidence


---------45:15----------
that there may be mental health


---------45:17----------
treatments that you can engage in which


---------45:19----------
will drastically reduce the hurt from


---------45:23----------
that thing the feeling of loneliness I


---------45:26----------
think also is something that we can


---------45:28----------
address the feeling of oh and this is


---------45:32----------
the big one is worth like you don't you


---------45:34----------
literally have not been taught that it's


---------45:36----------
okay for you to exist like I don't know


---------45:39----------
how else to put that but like literally


---------45:41----------
you were taught that you it's not okay


---------45:43----------
for you to exist


---------45:44----------
so most eight-year-olds sort of have


---------45:47----------
this fundamental sense of self that it's


---------45:49----------
like okay for me to be here right now


---------45:52----------
right like they walk up to you they're


---------45:54----------
like Daddy can I have food because they


---------45:56----------
have a presumption that like it's okay


---------45:58----------
for me to be here it's okay for me to


---------46:00----------
walk up to my dad and it's okay for me


---------46:02----------
to ask him for food if they feel hungry


---------46:04----------
like you were actually the most


---------46:06----------
devastating thing is you are not given


---------46:09----------
like a baseline permission to exist as a


---------46:16----------
human being and so I I don't know how


---------46:19----------
you're gonna find why you exist if


---------46:21----------
you're not even allowed to exist in the


---------46:23----------
first place does that make sense


---------46:25----------
yeah but it's like you don't even


---------46:28----------
deserve to have air to breathe is like


---------46:30----------
what you were told so it sort of starts


---------46:33----------
and this is where I think like you know


---------46:34----------
fully healed maybe we can actually like


---------46:36----------
you know go from we can print heal you


---------46:38----------
to like a hundred percent I think that's


---------46:40----------
possible unlikely but possible and in


---------46:44----------
the what the committee looks like is for


---------46:46----------
you to have a basic sense that you are


---------46:49----------
allowed to belong in the world and I


---------46:53----------
think you've got to be careful because


---------46:54----------
you're saying I don't feel like I belong


---------46:56----------
I think that's even the reason that you


---------46:58----------
haven't made progress is because I think


---------47:00----------
you're you're not really meeting


---------47:03----------
yourself where you're at it's not even


---------47:04----------
that like why do you belong that's not


---------47:07----------
even like that's one step ahead


---------47:09----------
it's are you even allowed to belong in


---------47:11----------
any way shape or form that's the first


---------47:13----------
question you got answer because I think


---------47:16----------
right now in your head there's a part of


---------47:19----------
you that the answer is no like you don't


---------47:23----------
deserve to be here at all like what do


---------47:26----------
you think about that yeah so I I have


---------47:31----------
thought about that as well a lot so I


---------47:33----------
tried to really live in the now so I


---------47:37----------
tried to be very neutral on that point


---------47:40----------
but before that yes 100% but now I still


---------47:45----------
try to be very neutral and I would say


---------47:49----------
yeah I don't know where I'm at at that


---------47:51----------
point okay oh you wouldn't say no or yes


---------47:54----------
so William I'm tempted to go down this


---------47:57----------
road with you but I think it could be


---------47:59----------
hard for you to understand because I


---------48:01----------
don't know how to explain it adequately


---------48:03----------
and I think we're gonna lose our viewers


---------48:05----------
even more but I'm gonna give it a shot


---------48:07----------
is that okay okay so let's start with


---------48:10----------
the idea that you don't even deserve to


---------48:12----------
be here in any way shape or form forget


---------48:15----------
about why am I here it's like you're not


---------48:18----------
allowed to be here to begin with with me


---------48:20----------
there okay okay so why am I here is a


---------48:25----------
question that's like for level two level


---------48:27----------
one question is do I get to be here with


---------48:30----------
me mm-hmm


---------48:31----------
then you said okay so that was a


---------48:33----------
question where you used to ask yourself


---------48:35----------
do I even get to be here do I get to


---------48:38----------
spawn in at all or do I like sit in the


---------48:41----------
lobby and like never get to spawn in and


---------48:42----------
don't get to play the game like why I'm


---------48:45----------
playing the game is a separate question


---------48:46----------
do I even get to spawn in with me yeah


---------48:49----------
yeah then you said you started being in


---------48:51----------
the present and the more that you're in


---------48:53----------
the present it sounds like it's easier


---------48:55----------
to get away from the question of do I


---------48:58----------
get to spawn in at all yes yeah yes now


---------49:03----------
let me ask you a question is being in


---------49:05----------
the present does that give you do you


---------49:08----------
feel like you have permission to exist


---------49:10----------
or do you distract yourself from the


---------49:13----------
question of whether you have permission


---------49:14----------
to exist


---------49:16----------
probably distracting myself from the


---------49:18----------
question I would say yeah okay I hope


---------49:21----------
people are able to follow that because


---------49:23----------
that's really important right because


---------49:25----------
what I think your perception of sliding


---------49:28----------
back is which in turn is gonna make you


---------49:30----------
hopeless right so the more that you feel


---------49:32----------
like you're moving forward and you slide


---------49:34----------
back the more your hopelessness is gonna


---------49:36----------
increase that's logical with me yeah


---------49:39----------
right so but I think that the reason


---------49:41----------
that you you're right to be hopeless


---------49:43----------
because that's not actually getting


---------49:45----------
healed that's like getting shielded


---------49:47----------
right and so a shield sort of gives you


---------49:50----------
the same effect as healing but it's not


---------49:52----------
really healing because when the shield


---------49:54----------
goes away like you're back to square one


---------49:56----------
and then you start to ask yourself can I


---------49:58----------
get healed when actually what you're


---------50:00----------
doing is you're distracting which is


---------50:01----------
like a shield its bonus hit points it's


---------50:04----------
not actual healing yeah so now I have to


---------50:10----------
think even if that's the case so I feel


---------50:12----------
like I understand you now I have the


---------50:13----------
problem of where do we go through so I'm


---------50:16----------
gonna need a second do you have


---------50:18----------
questions mmm no okay that would help me


---------50:23----------
a lot if you did but yeah you can ask me


---------50:26----------
questions if there's something unclear


---------50:28----------
no I mean there I mean there's a lot


---------50:31----------
that I want to know about you but I feel


---------50:33----------
like we're on the same page that you


---------50:36----------
know your attempts to get better aren't


---------50:40----------
really getting you better which I agree


---------50:42----------
with yeah I just don't know how to heal


---------50:44----------
you huh which I have to just give me a


---------50:48----------
second okay so I'm gonna think out all


---------50:54----------
right so you don't


---------50:56----------
even deserve to exist so how do we help


---------51:00----------
you understand that you deserve to exist


---------51:05----------
and do we want to ask you more questions


---------51:09----------
about so the safer route is probably we


---------51:13----------
just ask you more questions about how


---------51:15----------
you got how you came to know that you


---------51:20----------
don't deserve to exist or we can just


---------51:23----------
try to give you an experience of you


---------51:28----------
taking your existence for granted and


---------51:31----------
for you to understand and sit and feel


---------51:34----------
within yourself that you deserve to be


---------51:36----------
here something


---------51:42----------
as well yeah that might give you it so I


---------51:45----------
think this with it with the existence


---------51:48----------
part I think that also is very much


---------51:51----------
connected to the loneliness that I feel


---------51:52----------
like even when friends say that oh yeah


---------51:57----------
you mean a lot to me and stuff like that


---------52:02----------
it's it's kind of like I don't really


---------52:06----------
believe them yeah yes but I do have


---------52:12----------
worked with a lot of self-compassion and


---------52:14----------
taking like you complimented ghost in


---------52:19----------
the real world I have done like that


---------52:22----------
extremely many times yes like where I


---------52:25----------
dissociate disassociate myself


---------52:27----------
well extremely much like even when I'm


---------52:30----------
at a party with friends that are close


---------52:32----------
to me and everybody's happy I just


---------52:34----------
wonder like what am I doing here oh


---------52:36----------
right I have to take my happiness around


---------52:38----------
them and stuff like that this all what


---------52:40----------
yeah the the ghost thing is yeah


---------52:43----------
it's it's very it has been many of that


---------52:46----------
times yes


---------52:54----------
yeah sorry sorry for derailing you so so


---------52:56----------
you were saying you know your friends


---------52:58----------
have yeah I'm just getting the sense


---------53:00----------
that like you you know it's like you're


---------53:01----------
playing a game where you're like you


---------53:04----------
know you can interact with NPCs and


---------53:06----------
stuff but you're like you're like


---------53:07----------
ethereal you're not like a real


---------53:10----------
character


---------53:10----------
and it's like the NPC's are sort of


---------53:13----------
there and you're interacting with them


---------53:14----------
but you don't I mean it makes sense to


---------53:17----------
me that you you can't understand so it


---------53:20----------
sounds like you're confused not confused


---------53:22----------
but you really can't digest maybe that's


---------53:25----------
the word I'm looking for


---------53:26----------
that you bring value to other human


---------53:28----------
beings it's that fair like you don't


---------53:33----------
like you sort of get what they're saying


---------53:35----------
but like it doesn't yeah you're that


---------53:37----------
mean yeah you can't digest it like it's


---------53:39----------
not yeah right it's like it's like they


---------53:45----------
can't touch you you like their hand just


---------53:47----------
goes right through you it's like not


---------53:49----------
landing with you mm-hm and and I think


---------53:54----------
that comes back because you haven't like


---------53:55----------
zoned into the world yeah like you have


---------53:58----------
to be like in the world and like


---------54:00----------
existing there and understand that


---------54:02----------
you're there for other people to be able


---------54:04----------
to affect you


---------54:05----------
yeah and and I think a lot of the stuff


---------54:08----------
that people have tried isn't working


---------54:10----------
like the reason you can't get healed is


---------54:12----------
because you don't have a physical body


---------54:14----------
right you got a zone in first and like


---------54:17----------
not be a ghost and then you can like get


---------54:20----------
HP back but it comes with this basic it


---------54:23----------
comes to the basic idea that you do not


---------54:25----------
belong in this world and to me hmm what


---------54:30----------
do you think about that yeah I mean


---------54:35----------
sense but when am i when I was in a


---------54:37----------
relationship I could like I did touch


---------54:41----------
upon the world and stuff and none of


---------54:44----------
these thoughts has occurred where


---------54:46----------
anything like that I like the the colors


---------54:48----------
of the world just I appreciated it so


---------54:52----------
much more like autumn colors and stuff


---------54:54----------
like that like all small things like


---------54:56----------
because I before that I really faked a


---------55:00----------
lot like fake it till you make it I


---------55:02----------
faked my posture and things like that to


---------55:04----------
be happy but when I was in the world I


---------55:09----------
didn't even have to fake it I could see


---------55:10----------
it all and it began super clear for me


---------55:13----------
yeah so you're like a ghost that hidden


---------55:15----------
car nated and like you know ghosts see


---------55:16----------
the world in shades of grey and they


---------55:19----------
pretend but you had become a person so


---------55:23----------
it's it's actually great that you went


---------55:24----------
there because my next question was gonna


---------55:26----------
be can you tell me about your


---------55:27----------
relationship can you tell me about your


---------55:30----------
relationship how he was or char like how


---------55:33----------
did you meet your girl you said


---------55:37----------
girlfriend right yeah yeah well


---------55:43----------
technically yeah to friends yeah to


---------55:47----------
returns I'm thinking there's there was


---------55:49----------
one time we met earlier faced but


---------55:52----------
through threats yeah show me your honor


---------55:55----------
but there were some things that she


---------55:57----------
noticed with which I filtrated totally


---------56:02----------
right not really sure why even because


---------56:06----------
every time I've had a girlfriend and


---------56:08----------
talk and try to introduce them to my


---------56:12----------
parents were I I don't remember why I


---------56:15----------
did it


---------56:15----------
or if it was my mom forcing me to do it


---------56:18----------
I don't really remember why but they


---------56:20----------
were all super terrified with it which I


---------56:23----------
am but they all are super terrified


---------56:26----------
who's they


---------56:27----------
the girlfriends I've had ok the


---------56:29----------
different ones yeah and but


---------56:37----------
was when in a very long time she noticed


---------56:40----------
also how how toxic my mom was towards me


---------56:48----------
and I thought I didn't even think


---------56:50----------
anything of it because that was such a


---------56:52----------
kind of low tier toxic nough so to say


---------56:57----------
where I didn't even does your mom being


---------56:59----------
nice


---------56:59----------
yeah yeah exactly and and I did it like


---------57:03----------
that was so out of my filtration but she


---------57:05----------
mentioned that night she was like dude I


---------57:07----------
got so infuriated I wanted to like kind


---------57:11----------
of scream back at her or punch her but I


---------57:14----------
didn't even notice that and she had to


---------57:16----------
highlight that because usually it's so


---------57:18----------
much worse who said I want to scream at


---------57:20----------
someone and my girlfriend at that time


---------57:23----------
so she felt like screaming at your mom


---------57:25----------
yeah in punch sugar yeah at my mom


---------57:27----------
because my mom was trash-talking me so


---------57:29----------
much like so I was doing the cooking and


---------57:36----------
stuff like that and yeah working and


---------57:41----------
stuff like that so she said I I think


---------57:45----------
she said something along the line like


---------57:47----------
oh I I hope you take care of him he's so


---------57:50----------
useless he doesn't even know how to cook


---------57:52----------
and take care of himself and things like


---------57:55----------
that but yeah it got totally out of my


---------58:00----------
radar I didn't even think of it that


---------58:02----------
much how does it feel to have someone


---------58:05----------
who wants to defend you like that it


---------58:09----------
felt nice it's like it felt really nice


---------58:11----------
because in that time as I said I was


---------58:14----------
really living the world and I think


---------58:16----------
that's maybe why I'll also filtrated her


---------58:19----------
talk even better than ever


---------58:21----------
cuz I guess I guess no matter if I


---------58:24----------
ignore her and stuff like that it still


---------58:26----------
sips in through my ears no matter what


---------58:29----------
um no matter what I do and they even if


---------58:33----------
I pretend not to hear her or put like


---------58:34----------
earphones and earplugs in my ya ears


---------58:39----------
they still go through I still get


---------58:41----------
affected by it but there I didn't even


---------58:46----------
care about it so it's sure and


---------58:50----------
and so tell me about you guys were


---------58:52----------
together for five and a half years


---------58:53----------
that's a long time yeah yeah and they


---------58:55----------
actually moved in immediately even


---------58:57----------
together but yeah we talked about a lot


---------59:01----------
before and met before that as well in in


---------59:05----------
when did your breakup


---------59:07----------
um three years ago and when you happy


---------59:11----------
for the time that you all work together


---------59:14----------
yeah yeah what what ended up happened


---------59:19----------
did you feel like you had substance or


---------59:20----------
Restall ghost hi


---------59:22----------
I realized also I picked up a lot of


---------59:24----------
things like I realized but I don't know


---------59:27----------
exactly at what order it becomes um but


---------59:31----------
I realized I picked up some toxic nest


---------59:33----------
for my mom that I said to her and she


---------59:38----------
said it back to me ah like I think I


---------59:42----------
realized my toxic naissance stopped


---------59:44----------
myself but but then I realized that she


---------59:47----------
was quite toxic in in in the same way as


---------59:50----------
my mom beep in in a different way I mean


---------59:55----------
it was a little bit more toxic


---------59:56----------
relationship in the end that kill it I


---------59:59----------
would say what was toxic about your


---------60:01----------
relationship or it was actually much


---------60:03----------
more on to that than that there was some


---------60:07----------
things we didn't really agree on and


---------60:10----------
like what so will William here's here's


---------60:15----------
what I'm trying to do so I'm seeing the


---------60:17----------
beginning of your relationship where


---------60:18----------
you're happy


---------60:20----------
there's someone who cares about you is


---------60:22----------
defending yeah and I'm wondering like


---------60:24----------
what happened to that relationship yeah


---------60:29----------
I think it started fading out it


---------60:34----------
reference point like it's faded out more


---------60:36----------
and it started becoming heavy being in


---------60:43----------
the relationship ship two in the end


---------60:45----------
like it really didn't like yeah


---------60:49----------
something I kind of Google because I


---------60:53----------
tried a lot because I fear I think I


---------60:55----------
have like fear of embedment and stuff


---------60:56----------
like that so I tried to a lot to get


---------60:58----------
this relationship to work we even broke


---------61:00----------
up like yeah three times the third time


---------61:03----------
I really got the courage to really end


---------61:05----------
it but it took more maybe it was things


---------61:12----------
from the past that got back to me again


---------61:14----------
but he took more to actually be in the


---------61:16----------
relationship like he consumed so much up


---------61:19----------
more energy what was hard about the


---------61:21----------
relationship


---------61:32----------
everything I mean I don't know if it


---------61:35----------
makes sense but it's yeah and we didn't


---------61:42----------
really see like we did before as well


---------61:46----------
like the yeah like the sparks of being a


---------61:54----------
not really getting a lot of vagueness


---------61:55----------
from you I'm getting a lot of


---------61:57----------
conclusions and a lot of vagueness yes


---------62:00----------
and I really do understand you gave me a


---------62:04----------
lot of color and substance to the


---------62:06----------
beginning of your relationship yeah but


---------62:09----------
I'm sure you know a lot of color and


---------62:10----------
substance at the end you call it talk


---------62:12----------
yeah we tried to Stan yes sell stocks we


---------62:15----------
try to so I tried to get it to work for


---------62:22----------
a long time cuz well no that's way here


---------62:24----------
trying to get to work our relationship


---------62:29----------
to work that we had what was not work so


---------62:33----------
what I'm hearing very clearly is your


---------62:35----------
efforts in the hopelessness but I'm not


---------62:39----------
hearing like what the problem was that


---------62:41----------
there was like for instance we didn't


---------62:45----------
agree on like the dividing parts of like


---------62:50----------
fixing the house cleaning and cooking


---------62:52----------
like those trivial things and and tell


---------63:00----------
me how did you guys disagree about that


---------63:03----------
well


---------63:07----------
I'll break up with her there was a lot


---------63:10----------
of reasons a lot of reasons


---------63:14----------
they're from trivial to more complexed


---------63:19----------
but yeah sum it up it was like consuming


---------63:25----------
more energy than giving it up


---------63:28----------
tell me tell you why mmm there I don't


---------63:35----------
know how personal it is like I I don't


---------63:37----------
wanna say it without her permission and


---------63:39----------
stuff like that okay that's that's


---------63:41----------
totally that's good so yeah it's it's


---------63:43----------
it's too hard for me to actually say


---------63:45----------
it's here okay but you know what they


---------63:48----------
are yes I would say so yeah for sure cuz


---------63:52----------
I was the one proposing to even break up


---------63:55----------
to you and stuff like that yeah so I I


---------64:02----------
kind of raised those things to get it to


---------64:04----------
work but it didn't so that's why I was


---------64:08----------
like yeah so can you tell me what you


---------64:11----------
know we you said after a couple of years


---------64:12----------
it started to become harder like what


---------64:14----------
became harvard uh to be in the


---------64:18----------
relationship yeah what about the


---------64:21----------
relationship came hard yeah I mean to


---------64:24----------
even um I don't know it felt like it


---------64:29----------
hindered me a lot to like she was so shy


---------64:34----------
so whenever we had to meet friends I had


---------64:38----------
to be the one contacting and stuff like


---------64:39----------
that and I started irritating about


---------64:42----------
these stuffs as well like there was a


---------64:43----------
lot of things I started to get irritated


---------64:45----------
about and stuff like that is good you


---------64:46----------
feel like she wasn't pulling her weight


---------64:48----------
in the relationship like she was yeah


---------64:52----------
her fair share


---------64:53----------
yes yes definitely that's one of the big


---------64:59----------
ones well that's one of the bigger


---------65:00----------
reasons


---------65:00----------
can you just map out the other bigger


---------65:02----------
reasons like I once again you don't have


---------65:04----------
to say anything that you're concerned


---------65:05----------
about yeah I I mean is that okay to


---------65:08----------
share with us or is that not okay [ __ ]


---------65:11----------
well first let's cuz I don't want you to


---------65:12----------
say things that you don't want to say


---------65:13----------
but like if I ya know I'm gonna skip


---------65:16----------
that because I okay want her to me first


---------65:19----------
- yeah let me okay then let me say this


---------65:25----------
but we went on a psychologist to get a


---------65:29----------
try to try to fix it as a co well that's


---------65:31----------
good so yeah we really tried a lot of


---------65:34----------
things but yes have you been dating now


---------65:41----------
yeah you gonna pick up three years ago


---------65:43----------
right yeah yeah yeah I've been on some


---------65:48----------
dates and yeah I have yes somewhat


---------66:01----------
disappointing but yeah but one of them


---------66:03----------
was quite nice I would say um but I I


---------66:08----------
don't think it's gonna lead to anywhere


---------66:10----------
yeah why not cuz she doesn't really want


---------66:16----------
to have anything serious and you were


---------66:20----------
looking for something serious yeah I


---------66:22----------
would say so but I've been thinking a


---------66:25----------
lot about just being happy and stuff


---------66:26----------
like that - in in the relationship so


---------66:29----------
that's kind of what we agreed and now as


---------66:31----------
we are where we are


---------66:33----------
yes okay but yeah I would definitely


---------66:40----------
want a more serious um I wouldn't


---------66:50----------
here I actually got a lot of things


---------66:54----------
from your community it's an awesome


---------66:56----------
community so I'm actually digging into


---------66:59----------
which yeah sparked some more new hopes


---------67:02----------
for me as well and I've actually done


---------67:04----------
something else that has made me feel so


---------67:07----------
much better now as well so I'm actually


---------67:09----------
more at the yeah it's been good but yeah


---------67:13----------
I just made future itself what have you


---------67:16----------
been so it sounds like you started


---------67:19----------
feeling better after hmm because at the


---------67:21----------
very beginning you said you started


---------67:23----------
feeling better after being like active


---------67:24----------
in our community then you started to


---------67:26----------
slip back so yeah well yeah but slipping


---------67:29----------
back was even before or even in the


---------67:31----------
community but I tried an SSRI


---------67:35----------
alternative which helps a lot so yeah


---------67:43----------
now that just lifted me up a lot and I


---------67:51----------
found


---------67:52----------
think that correlates to me a lot


---------67:54----------
someone linked some sea PTSD if you know


---------67:58----------
what it is yeah yeah and it resonates


---------68:01----------
extremely much with me so I'm actually


---------68:03----------
reading a book about it now so good in


---------68:06----------
hopes and so far 40 50 pages in and I


---------68:11----------
feel like it's describing me literally


---------68:12----------
yeah so what's the book that it it's


---------68:17----------
called from well see PTSD from surviving


---------68:22----------
to thriving cool yeah okay so when did


---------68:31----------
you start to get better because it


---------68:32----------
sounds like you started getting better


---------68:33----------
recently so it sounds like there was it


---------68:35----------
was when I took this alternative I I


---------68:38----------
don't know if it's better it just it


---------68:42----------
just removes the debuff so to say by I


---------68:45----------
don't know what happens if I stop it or


---------68:47----------
like the wound is still there tried to


---------68:51----------
heal and heal right so it's gonna be


---------68:55----------
interesting to see when I stopped doing


---------68:57----------
that for a while what what's gonna


---------68:58----------
happen as well so I'm at you sir are you


---------69:00----------
feeling better nowadays I am feeling


---------69:04----------
better when I've started taking it yes


---------69:06----------
how long have you been taking it one and


---------69:12----------
a half month okay hmm and and so it


---------69:17----------
sounds like you now in your psychologist


---------69:19----------
is aware that you have C PTSD or no I


---------69:23----------
actually called her up and mention it


---------69:26----------
when I got to know about it and we


---------69:28----------
actually took a session again and stuff


---------69:29----------
like that cuz she was not really


---------69:33----------
surprised if I fall him back but I told


---------69:35----------
her that I've fallen back to the battle


---------69:37----------
tracks and stuff like that but I'm


---------69:41----------
really confused are you or have you


---------69:42----------
fallen back are you doing better I'm


---------69:46----------
sorry I feel after up taking the


---------69:52----------
alternatives I feel better


---------69:55----------
like I have energy to do things now yeah


---------69:58----------
it's not a big weight I can't even do my


---------70:01----------
hobbies I can't even game I couldn't


---------70:03----------
even game before like II I got disgusted


---------70:05----------
by me


---------70:06----------
playing ADA because I okay anything I


---------70:08----------
did was just horrible water yeah


---------70:11----------
sigh even though when I forced myself to


---------70:14----------
do things I couldn't but now I actually


---------70:18----------
can do things good for you man yeah


---------70:23----------
definitely


---------70:26----------
so yes I am better but I wonder if I'm


---------70:30----------
better only because I'm taking them and


---------70:32----------
then when I stop I come come back


---------70:33----------
exactly where I was before like yes that


---------70:38----------
what I can help you with so what can I


---------70:40----------
help you with mmm I was wondering if you


---------70:48----------
if you knew where to go next


---------70:51----------
fantastic from my point of view yeah


---------70:54----------
okay and that I can certainly help you


---------70:58----------
William it sounds like you're doing


---------71:01----------
better yeah and what I'm hearing from


---------71:05----------
you is fear that the only reason you're


---------71:07----------
doing better is because you have this


---------71:09----------
artificial medication that's tampering


---------71:11----------
with your neuro chemistry and that


---------71:13----------
you're not actually doing better hmm so


---------71:16----------
now let me tell you what healing looks


---------71:18----------
like okay so like I guess what I'm


---------71:21----------
hearing from you is can I still get


---------71:24----------
healed or is this another shield yeah


---------71:27----------
like because the medication feels like a


---------71:29----------
shield and that's I think exactly what


---------71:30----------
it is and can you be fully healed and


---------71:36----------
maybe what you're looking for me is


---------71:37----------
direction and how to get fully healed or


---------71:40----------
how to get healed and what's the role of


---------71:42----------
medication how do you move forward and


---------71:46----------
the short answer is that I think okay so


---------71:48----------
here we go okay and then I'll give you a


---------71:50----------
chance to ask questions then maybe we'll


---------71:52----------
meditate and we'll wrap up does that


---------71:53----------
sound okay yep okay so I'm gonna start


---------71:58----------
by sharing with you something called


---------71:59----------
bunch of Goya theory which is gorgeou


---------72:02----------
means sheath like what you put a sword


---------72:04----------
in you know like a sheet and then bunch


---------72:07----------
means five so the idea here is that you


---------72:10----------
have five layers of being so when we


---------72:13----------
think about William William is like has


---------72:17----------
a physical body and then William also


---------72:19----------
has


---------72:19----------
thoughts like those are separate things


---------72:22----------
right like if I if you lose an arm or


---------72:25----------
you still William yep if you have a body


---------72:29----------
and then unfortunately like your


---------72:31----------
grandmother it sounds like she's got


---------72:32----------
dementia and I you know it's a terrible


---------72:34----------
thing to deal with you know she has a


---------72:37----------
physical body but like who she is as a


---------72:39----------
person has sort of slipped away right so


---------72:43----------
do you see that like who a person is is


---------72:46----------
not like mind or body


---------72:49----------
it's like mine bus body plus actually


---------72:51----------
other stuff so a couple thousand years


---------72:55----------
ago Yogi's or Ayurvedic physicians


---------72:57----------
called vidiians unclear exactly you know


---------73:00----------
what they were said that basically there


---------73:02----------
are five layers of being so the first


---------73:06----------
layer of being is physical the second is


---------73:08----------
energetic the third is emotional the


---------73:11----------
fourth is intellectual and the fifth is


---------73:13----------
spiritual and I think in order for you


---------73:16----------
to be healed you've got to get like


---------73:18----------
healing done on all of those levels okay


---------73:23----------
so let's talk about each of your


---------73:25----------
problems wonder if I should draw this


---------73:28----------
out can you hold on a second I'm gonna


---------73:32----------
go grab do you want iPad do you want


---------73:34----------
diagrams planets okay give me a second


---------73:38----------
okay let's just take a quick break it


---------73:40----------
run to the restroom if you need to I'm


---------73:42----------
gonna grab water and then I'm gonna grab


---------73:45----------
my iPad okay can you see we good to go


---------73:48----------
let's check in with twitch chat can you


---------73:50----------
all see that okay all right


---------73:53----------
so William your joshimuz how do you get


---------73:56----------
fully healed right yeah and we're yeah


---------74:01----------
yeah so yeah I'm gonna tell you how you


---------74:04----------
can get fully healed okay so it starts


---------74:08----------
with this bunch goorsha


---------74:09----------
okay so you have physical energetic and


---------74:14----------
what I'm gonna do is break down your


---------74:16----------
quote-unquote


---------74:17----------
diagnosis amongst these and so you're


---------74:20----------
gonna see how all of the things that are


---------74:22----------
wrong with you not I mean all but that's


---------74:24----------
grandiose so I'm gonna show you the


---------74:28----------
different essentially you've got like


---------74:30----------
five layers and what's going on is that


---------74:33----------
of your layers has been attacked and


---------74:35----------
damaged in different ways so the process


---------74:38----------
of filth all healing actually requires


---------74:40----------
you to to heal each of these layers and


---------74:44----------
we'll sort of it requires you to heal


---------74:47----------
each of the layers and then the other


---------74:49----------
problem that I'll try to show you is why


---------74:51----------
you feel hopeless because the things


---------74:53----------
that you're healing are actually not on


---------74:55----------
the layer that the damage was done and


---------74:58----------
I'll explain what that means okay so the


---------75:00----------
first thing is is you have this sense of


---------75:04----------
sluggishness right so let's do like dye


---------75:07----------
diagnosis here okay and then let's do


---------75:10----------
like treatment over here so if we think


---------75:13----------
about sluggishness do you think that


---------75:15----------
that's physical energetic emotional


---------75:18----------
intellectual or spiritual your body


---------75:20----------
being heavy physical okay so sluggish I


---------75:25----------
don't know actually in no way I yeah


---------75:27----------
wait it's an energetic


---------75:29----------
very good so it's actually on more than


---------75:31----------
one and okay so let's think about like


---------75:36----------
so just talking to your psychologist


---------75:39----------
help you with your feelings of


---------75:41----------
sluggishness if it helped yes does it I


---------75:49----------
mean it came


---------75:51----------
yeah okay but so so not as a hell not as


---------75:55----------
heavy as before as well okay so so this


---------75:58----------
is a good example of like if we have you


---------76:00----------
know emotional treatment here so if we


---------76:03----------
do medication that gives us a lot of


---------76:07----------
healing right if we do talk therapy


---------76:12----------
so that's actually the emotional mind


---------76:15----------
right so if we do emotional treatments


---------76:19----------
for physical problems we get a little


---------76:20----------
bit of benefit but do you see how


---------76:24----------
medication helps way more than talking


---------76:26----------
about your feelings mm-hmm so the other


---------76:29----------
interesting thing okay so we'll get to


---------76:32----------
that so the other thing that you can do


---------76:33----------
is have you ever done chi gong or prana


---------76:36----------
I am do you meditate with us on stream


---------76:39----------
I've meditated for a while yes okay so


---------76:43----------
there are some kinds of meditation that


---------76:46----------
are called Brown ayam or in the Chinese


---------76:48----------
system what's your ethnicity by the way


---------76:50----------
yeah it's Chinese and what part of the


---------76:53----------
world are you in Sweden okay so like if


---------76:57----------
you do pranayama or Qi Gong these are


---------76:59----------
specifically meditative practices that


---------77:01----------
are aimed at boosting your energetic


---------77:04----------
self or your chi or your prana


---------77:07----------
does that make sense mm-hmm so it's like


---------77:11----------
not like meditating on you know the


---------77:13----------
nature of things or stuff like that it's


---------77:15----------
not an intellectual meditation it's like


---------77:18----------
an energetic meditation so if you guys


---------77:20----------
have ever heard of the wim HOF method


---------77:21----------
have you ever heard of wim HOF no so wim


---------77:25----------
HOF is this guy who learned this like


---------77:28----------
form of I think Tibetan meditation where


---------77:31----------
like he can now do things that are


---------77:33----------
physically impossible in terms of like


---------77:35----------
resisting cold so he'll go and like sit


---------77:38----------
and die yeah and so the thing is like


---------77:41----------
what he does is like physically not


---------77:43----------
possible you can't be in hypothermic


---------77:45----------
water for an hour and like not lose


---------77:48----------
fingers but that's literally what wim


---------77:50----------
HOF is capable of doing what wim HOF


---------77:52----------
does is pran I am so like vish it


---------77:56----------
absolutely works there's also data that


---------77:59----------
suggests that doing Brown I am actually


---------78:01----------
makes you resistant to heart attacks


---------78:02----------
which I can go into the physiology of


---------78:04----------
like


---------78:04----------
how that works but because it's actually


---------78:08----------
really fascinating the point is that you


---------78:10----------
can actually do things through Braun I


---------78:12----------
am and chi-gong that will boost your


---------78:15----------
energy I don't know how else to put it


---------78:17----------
but like when you feel sluggishness if I


---------78:20----------
were to do blood tests I may find


---------78:23----------
vitamin D being low right so that's an


---------78:27----------
example of something that leads to


---------78:28----------
depression low level vitamin D levels


---------78:31----------
lead to depression it's possible that


---------78:32----------
your vitamin D deficient but you just


---------78:34----------
feel sluggish if I take you to a doctor


---------78:36----------
and they listen to your lungs and I take


---------78:38----------
you to like an orthopedic surgeon and I


---------78:41----------
get him to like test your strength


---------78:42----------
nothing is physically gonna be wrong


---------78:44----------
with your body you get that when you're


---------78:46----------
sluggish but yeah something it feels


---------78:49----------
like literally like your sluggishness is


---------78:51----------
an energy problem and there are some


---------78:53----------
techniques what the yogis realize like


---------78:55----------
there are some techniques that you can


---------78:57----------
do to boost your energy because you're


---------78:58----------
not doing something physical it's like


---------79:01----------
they're working specifically on the


---------79:02----------
energetic body another good example of


---------79:05----------
this is yoga or Tai Chi and there are


---------79:08----------
studies that show that yoga and Tai Chi


---------79:10----------
is superior to exercise its meaning


---------79:12----------
things like arthritis and if you go to


---------79:15----------
people who are experts in yoga and you


---------79:17----------
ask them why do you think that yoga is


---------79:19----------
superior to exercise because then both


---------79:21----------
of them you're moving right so like why


---------79:24----------
is yoga superior to Tai Chi in some


---------79:26----------
clinical trials there's a great paper by


---------79:29----------
for example Chen Chen Wang in the New


---------79:32----------
England Journal of Medicine from like


---------79:37----------
2010 12 where she does a trial on


---------79:42----------
osteoarthritis and compares Tai Chi to


---------79:44----------
exercise and finds that Tai Chi is


---------79:46----------
superior and so the question is that


---------79:48----------
both of these are physical practices


---------79:49----------
scientifically how is it that Tai Chi


---------79:53----------
outperforms exercise because you're


---------79:54----------
moving your body in both cases does that


---------79:57----------
make sense but how that you should get


---------79:59----------
the same effect but clearly


---------80:00----------
scientifically we are finding that Tai


---------80:02----------
Chi is not the same as exercise and if


---------80:05----------
you ask Tai Chi masters what they say is


---------80:07----------
yeah it's because we work on an


---------80:08----------
energetic level not just the physical


---------80:09----------
one what does that mean


---------80:11----------
no one has any [ __ ] idea like


---------80:13----------
scientists have been trying to find


---------80:14----------
evidence of chi or prana and they've


---------80:16----------
never been


---------80:16----------
to find it all we know is that when you


---------80:19----------
incorporate when you design a practice


---------80:22----------
that's based on this hoity-toity


---------80:24----------
unscientific principle of energy it


---------80:26----------
actually outperforms purely physical


---------80:29----------
practices that is a scientific fact so


---------80:32----------
my point is that in terms of healing


---------80:34----------
yourself you can do these things okay


---------80:37----------
and what that's gonna do over time is


---------80:40----------
when you take out the medication you're


---------80:42----------
gonna lose the benefit of the medication


---------80:44----------
you with me yeah but if you do these


---------80:48----------
things in the meantime this is gonna


---------80:50----------
make a very slow plus very very slow and


---------80:54----------
if you do this for six months and then


---------80:56----------
you stop medication you're gonna have


---------80:59----------
like a plus that's left over and you'll


---------81:02----------
do better without medication does that


---------81:03----------
make sense


---------81:04----------
mm-hmm okay so basically the thing about


---------81:08----------
energetic practices in Bronte um is that


---------81:10----------
they're gonna heal you that it's like


---------81:12----------
it's like a regeneration buff you're


---------81:14----------
gonna heal like one hit point every week


---------81:17----------
and so if that's all you do when you're


---------81:20----------
feeling super depressed and sluggish


---------81:22----------
it's not gonna be finished enough for


---------81:24----------
you to notice any difference with me


---------81:26----------
yeah I can't see your face now that's


---------81:29----------
why I'm asking


---------81:29----------
oh okay and at the same time it's


---------81:32----------
because I have the iPad pulled up gotcha


---------81:34----------
so oh actually but maybe yeah I have to


---------81:37----------
have it below but at the same time it is


---------81:40----------
gonna heal you over time the other


---------81:43----------
problem is that if you are sluggish


---------81:45----------
you're not gonna have the time or energy


---------81:48----------
to be able to do yoga or pranayama


---------81:50----------
does that make sense yeah so what we


---------81:55----------
have to do is start with medication so


---------81:57----------
that you feel more energy and then you


---------81:59----------
use that shield or the artificial energy


---------82:03----------
boost of medication to start to do other


---------82:06----------
things that are gonna lead to more


---------82:07----------
long-term healing you good with that


---------82:11----------
yeah yeah okay now we're gonna talk


---------82:13----------
about other things so then okay so this


---------82:15----------
is fine but is your problem restricted


---------82:17----------
to physical and energetic stuff no where


---------82:21----------
does see PTSD go and will explain what


---------82:25----------
that is in a second where do you think


---------82:26----------
see PTSD fix fits on


---------82:30----------
and like emotional absolutely okay


---------82:36----------
so let's explain what see PTSD is can


---------82:38----------
you tell us what it means complex PTSD


---------82:41----------
and what makes something complex PTSD


---------82:44----------
versus regular PTSD um I'm event that


---------82:49----------
continuously happens over a period of


---------82:52----------
time rather than just one event


---------82:53----------
excellent so let's say that you know I'm


---------82:56----------
walking down the street and I walk past


---------82:58----------
some of the riots that are going on and


---------83:00----------
a police officer shoots a rubber bullet


---------83:03----------
and I'm carrying my groceries which


---------83:05----------
actually happened to a lady and the the


---------83:07----------
bullet hits me in the face and you know


---------83:09----------
even people have lost eyes and stuff so


---------83:12----------
that's a one-time event that leads to


---------83:14----------
post-traumatic stress disorder all you


---------83:17----------
need is a single event to end up with


---------83:19----------
post-traumatic stress disorder


---------83:21----------
post-traumatic stress disorder affects


---------83:23----------
people in particular ways it's


---------83:25----------
characterized by flashbacks nightmares


---------83:27----------
things like that but their intrinsic


---------83:29----------
sense of self is not necessarily


---------83:32----------
destroyed by a singular event right


---------83:35----------
because if I walk down the street and


---------83:36----------
like I'm dr. K and I'm like I feel


---------83:38----------
confident in Who I am as a human being


---------83:40----------
and something traumatic happens to me


---------83:42----------
that's terrible and it could be


---------83:44----------
destroying me as a human being but it


---------83:45----------
doesn't have to destroy me as a human


---------83:47----------
being


---------83:47----------
what complex PTSD is is when trauma


---------83:51----------
happens to you over and over and over


---------83:54----------
and over again so when William tells us


---------83:58----------
that he is an eight-year-old boy who is


---------84:00----------
screaming at his mom to stop and banging


---------84:03----------
his head against a wall and she


---------84:04----------
continues to yell at him for an hour and


---------84:06----------
a half and that [ __ ] happens day after


---------84:09----------
day after day after day that is a whole


---------84:12----------
different ball game


---------84:13----------
from being like shot once or being


---------84:15----------
robbed or being raped or whatever that's


---------84:18----------
complex PTSD okay so now let's think


---------84:21----------
about what are the treatments of complex


---------84:24----------
PTSD what do you think medication is


---------84:28----------
going to do for that


---------84:33----------
it just gives you this temporary booth


---------84:36----------
buff that we talked about like right so


---------84:39----------
that's kind of like talking for emotions


---------84:43----------
though talking at like acting on an


---------84:45----------
emotional level for a physical problem


---------84:47----------
only gives you like one point of healing


---------84:50----------
does that make sense


---------84:51----------
hmm and so medication for an emotional


---------84:54----------
problem only gives you one point of


---------84:56----------
healing does that make sense yeah yeah


---------85:00----------
right so I want could I add something as


---------85:03----------
well sure so I think what we tried to


---------85:06----------
cure was like regular PTSD so to say


---------85:09----------
with my psychologist but and that's why


---------85:12----------
I guess it caused so much confusion why


---------85:14----------
I'm still feeling as I did and stuff


---------85:16----------
like that excellent so you're you took


---------85:19----------
you took the next part right out of my


---------85:21----------
mouth the real truth is that complex


---------85:25----------
PTSD doesn't go here it goes here and


---------85:29----------
this is where PTSD goes because with


---------85:33----------
what complex PTSD what happens is that


---------85:35----------
your sense of a human being gets [ __ ]


---------85:45----------
that's a spiritual problem this goes


---------85:48----------
back to ghosts why am I here right


---------85:55----------
that's not emotions do I deserve to live


---------86:05----------
does that make sense like


---------86:07----------
that's not an emotional issue that's


---------86:09----------
like a spiritual issue what do you think


---------86:13----------
about that huh yeah yeah it makes total


---------86:16----------
sense cuz it's it I mean it didn't


---------86:19----------
really help me so it's example so this


---------86:22----------
is why talk therapy is gonna be 1 plus 2


---------86:26----------
plus or three pluses hmm what do you


---------86:31----------
think okay makes sense 1 plus right so


---------86:37----------
your psychologist can help you here if


---------86:39----------
you had regular PTSD but the


---------86:43----------
psychologist is only going to be a 1 +


---------86:46----------
over here and this is the biggest


---------86:48----------
problem that I think actually your


---------86:50----------
psychologist can't help you with three


---------86:51----------
pluses but they have to do that kind of


---------86:54----------
work so this is the biggest problem that


---------86:56----------
I see with like a lot of quote unquote


---------86:57----------
mental health diagnosis is that like so


---------87:00----------
the reason that I'm an effective


---------87:02----------
psychiatrist is because I actually don't


---------87:04----------
do a whole lot of psychiatry what I do


---------87:07----------
is a lot of spiritual work because I


---------87:09----------
think people like you when I said that


---------87:11----------
if the core of your problem will is or


---------87:14----------
William is that like you don't even know


---------87:16----------
if you deserve to live so we can deal


---------87:19----------
with the suicidality and the negative


---------87:20----------
emotions and shame and all that [ __ ] all


---------87:22----------
of that stuff is over here right so this


---------87:24----------
is shame you know feels bad man right


---------87:31----------
that's all emotional stuff and now we


---------87:34----------
get to another problem which is that


---------87:35----------
you're an analytical guy so what you try


---------87:39----------
to do is essentially like ant like you


---------87:41----------
use analytical treatments for emotional


---------87:45----------
problems and this is the worst is that


---------87:47----------
when you ask yourself like what you have


---------87:51----------
this feeling of being a ghost right and


---------87:52----------
then what happens is you start asking


---------87:54----------
yourself questions about do I deserve to


---------87:57----------
be here you start to use your analytical


---------88:00----------
mind to solve a spiritual problem and


---------88:02----------
that doesn't actually get you [ __ ] or


---------88:04----------
maybe oneplus does that I guess this is


---------88:08----------
the reason why I can't where they listen


---------88:09----------
to it as well like any emotions as that


---------88:13----------
feel would Lincoln is say more about


---------88:15----------
that so like I try to listen to my


---------88:19----------
emotions why


---------88:20----------
am i failing sad and [ __ ] right now but


---------88:24----------
it's more like a constant noise and and


---------88:25----------
it's it's more because it's on the


---------88:27----------
spiritual level rather than the


---------88:29----------
emotional or either one so eat your


---------88:32----------
analytical an analytical approach to


---------88:34----------
your emotions is gonna get you even if


---------88:36----------
it's emotional the analytical approach


---------88:38----------
is not going to help very much and if


---------88:40----------
it's spiritual it's not going to help


---------88:42----------
very much the whole reason that people


---------88:45----------
like you have trouble getting fully


---------88:47----------
healed is because your treatments do not


---------88:49----------
line up with the sources of your


---------88:51----------
problems


---------88:52----------
right for a physical problem you need a


---------88:54----------
physical treatment for an energetic


---------88:57----------
problem you need an energetic treatment


---------88:58----------
for an emotional problem you need talk


---------89:00----------
therapy for complex PTSD you need to


---------89:04----------
figure out why am I here and how do I


---------89:06----------
deserve to live now that's not going to


---------89:07----------
happen to them through talk therapy


---------89:09----------
that's gonna happen through something


---------89:10----------
like meditation right and how does


---------89:14----------
meditation help you have to sit and you


---------89:16----------
have to feel that you and like it's kind


---------89:19----------
of hard to describe or happiness in a


---------89:23----------
relationship right so during the good


---------89:29----------
years with your golf girlfriend because


---------89:31----------
where does happiness in a relationship


---------89:33----------
go here it's not just emotional maybe


---------89:35----------
it's emotional right so maybe maybe goes


---------89:39----------
over here too I'm not really sure okay


---------89:47----------
but the key thing is that I think when


---------89:49----------
you were happy in the relationship the


---------89:51----------
reason that you felt more human and less


---------89:54----------
of a ghost's the reason you saw the


---------89:55----------
world in color is because she gave you a


---------89:58----------
sense of belonging what do you think


---------90:01----------
about that know for sure for sure and so


---------90:05----------
what happened is she answered this


---------90:07----------
question for you do I deserve to live


---------90:09----------
and in the way that she interacted with


---------90:11----------
you as a human being made you think that


---------90:13----------
the answer is yes and as their


---------90:16----------
relationship declined your sense of


---------90:18----------
deserving to live was was still young


---------90:21----------
and fragile so two years of a


---------90:24----------
relationship with a shy girl who doesn't


---------90:26----------
understand quite as much about life as


---------90:28----------
let's say someone else does could not


---------90:31----------
strengthen you enough she couldn't do


---------90:34----------
in two years of loving you and making


---------90:38----------
you feel like you belong she could not


---------90:40----------
undo 22 years of emotional damage and


---------90:43----------
complex PTSD which makes perfect [ __ ]


---------90:45----------
sense right and then when when the


---------90:50----------
relationship goes sour it's not enough


---------90:52----------
and so can you be fully healed


---------90:56----------
absolutely now I feel confident because


---------90:59----------
I've talked myself into it and I've


---------91:00----------
convinced myself in the way that you get


---------91:03----------
fully healed is that you do this and


---------91:07----------
this kind of goes back to earlier when I


---------91:09----------
was saying okay like it actually like


---------91:11----------
you have lots of different problems


---------91:13----------
absolutely and so fully heal doesn't


---------91:16----------
come from medication it comes from all


---------91:19----------
of this [ __ ] because you have [ __ ] going


---------91:20----------
on on every part of your being right the


---------91:24----------
only thing that I'm not sure is it


---------91:25----------
doesn't sound like you have an


---------91:26----------
intellectual problem what what is that


---------91:29----------
exactly


---------91:30----------
so I don't hear like strong cognitive


---------91:32----------
biases about the way that you view


---------91:35----------
yourself hmm right so like some of the


---------91:40----------
people that I talk to like a good


---------91:42----------
example of this like a couple weeks ago


---------91:43----------
we had interviewed sweet Anita and


---------91:45----------
Sweden EDA felt like she doesn't deserve


---------91:48----------
to like take care of herself so


---------91:50----------
cognitive bias goes over here oh I guess


---------91:56----------
I've worked


---------91:57----------
on that part absolutely and that's why I


---------91:59----------
don't think we see it because you did


---------92:01----------
yeah CBT or psychologist yeah right


---------92:07----------
self-compassion helped a lot extremely a


---------92:10----------
lot and meditation helped a lot in that


---------92:12----------
part too yep I would say right so the


---------92:15----------
cognate so let's just think about this


---------92:17----------
so in in emotion creates a cognitive


---------92:22----------
bias does this make sense like the


---------92:24----------
emotion is on the emotional level and


---------92:26----------
then you feel like you're a piece of


---------92:27----------
[ __ ] and then your analytical mind


---------92:30----------
creates justifications for why you're a


---------92:32----------
piece of [ __ ] but that's a separate part


---------92:34----------
of your mind and you can use self


---------92:37----------
compassion sorry guys this is getting


---------92:41----------
messy so self compassion is going to


---------92:44----------
target this and CBT which is cognitive


---------92:47----------
behavioral therapy is gonna target the


---------92:49----------
analytical construction based on the


---------92:52----------
root of your negative emotion does that


---------92:56----------
make sense yeah okay questions you wrote


---------93:04----------
meditation at the spiritual it's an a


---------93:07----------
kind of general meditation or what knows


---------93:09----------
I have been meditating for quite a while


---------93:11----------
yep so you need to do meditations that


---------93:15----------
are geared towards discovering your


---------93:17----------
sense of self so this is it's like this


---------93:23----------
people call this meditation to self


---------93:26----------
compassion like Metta meditation is over


---------93:29----------
here so that's like self compassion like


---------93:32----------
loving-kindness meditation yeah right so


---------93:36----------
there are lots of different kinds of


---------93:37----------
meditation and they work on different


---------93:38----------
levels there are also some meditations


---------93:41----------
like I'll ask people to do investigative


---------93:43----------
meditations like what is the sound of


---------93:45----------
the breath that's like


---------93:50----------
kind of an intellectual meditation so


---------93:53----------
you need to do like Who am I and in


---------93:58----------
particular there are a few powerful


---------94:00----------
mantras that will help you answer this


---------94:03----------
question okay but that's the kind of


---------94:09----------
method I'll teach you something today I


---------94:10----------
just gotta think about this the first


---------94:12----------
thing that I need to do is check in with


---------94:13----------
you though does this make sense it makes


---------94:17----------
a lot of sense yeah I'm actually really


---------94:22----------
happy to actually even see it in picture


---------94:25----------
and then and noticing and seeing the


---------94:28----------
parts like because I believe I've come a


---------94:31----------
really far away even in these like


---------94:33----------
twenty-one years even though I have like


---------94:36----------
aimlessly gone somewhere I think it


---------94:39----------
still learned me something along the way


---------94:41----------
and it makes sense when adding


---------94:43----------
everything because yeah it's maybe it's


---------94:46----------
more like all these sections I have to


---------94:48----------
work on and there's like one last piece


---------94:50----------
I haven't which I guess is like the


---------94:52----------
spiritual which I haven't really dealt


---------94:56----------
with so yeah it actually makes much


---------95:03----------
sense and yeah and so here's here's why


---------95:06----------
I think your hopelessness is completely


---------95:08----------
understandable because when you have


---------95:10----------
complex PTSD and you go to a


---------95:13----------
professional and they give you a


---------95:16----------
medication that's not gonna work and so


---------95:19----------
basically the the basic problem that


---------95:21----------
that I think the reason that you're


---------95:22----------
hopeless and it's not your fault I think


---------95:24----------
you've actually done remarkably well


---------95:25----------
given the hand that you were dealt it's


---------95:27----------
actually [ __ ] amazing is that you're


---------95:29----------
like all of your treatments are like all


---------95:32----------
over the place you're trying to solve


---------95:33----------
stuff with some courses from like other


---------95:36----------
courses and so your effect size it's


---------95:39----------
gonna be kind of like you're you know


---------95:40----------
I'm continuously like trying to heal


---------95:42----------
your right arm even though the damage is


---------95:44----------
in your left leg and the issue is that


---------95:46----------
you get a little bit of bandwidth you


---------95:48----------
get a little bit from here you get a


---------95:50----------
little bit from here and then over time


---------95:53----------
though it feels like it's not really


---------95:55----------
working because you're not targeting


---------95:56----------
your treatments towards what you've done


---------95:58----------
you are actually the if that's not even


---------96:00----------
entirely true because I think you've


---------96:03----------
actually like


---------96:04----------
cuz you had problems here and here too


---------96:06----------
it's just you've done you've actually


---------96:09----------
found good treatments right so you had


---------96:11----------
emotional feelings of and this is


---------96:13----------
exactly why it's beautiful so you had


---------96:15----------
emotional feelings of shame and then you


---------96:17----------
say self compassion helped with that and


---------96:19----------
this is the mistake this is the


---------96:20----------
diagnostic mistake that people make when


---------96:22----------
someone has complex PTSD and they've


---------96:25----------
they're filled with shame and they get


---------96:27----------
treated with self compassion they think


---------96:29----------
they are fixed but they're not fixed


---------96:32----------
because they never got to this hmm right


---------96:37----------
and so then you get hopeless because you


---------96:39----------
said okay I have complex PTSD I have all


---------96:41----------
these negative emotions I learn self


---------96:43----------
compassion and I'm not fixed and then


---------96:44----------
hopelessness is completely reasonable


---------96:46----------
because complex pts you thought you did


---------96:49----------
the treatment for complex PTSD and


---------96:51----------
you're not better and so then you're


---------96:54----------
hopeless absolutely man you should be


---------96:57----------
hopeless because you thought you did


---------96:58----------
what you needed to do and you did a lot


---------97:00----------
which you can tell us and you're like


---------97:02----------
hey I actually grew a lot there hey the


---------97:04----------
medication is actually really helping


---------97:05----------
and you're not fully healed and so then


---------97:08----------
your your question is beautiful now we


---------97:10----------
come back to your original question can


---------97:12----------
I become fully healed in the answer and


---------97:14----------
it's completely reasonable for you to


---------97:16----------
ask that question because you did this


---------97:18----------
and you did this and you talked to a


---------97:20----------
psychologist and you found yourself not


---------97:23----------
being fully healed yeah and then you


---------97:26----------
start to question your like if I talk to


---------97:28----------
the psychologist more if I add on more


---------97:30----------
medications or if I learn more self


---------97:32----------
compassion


---------97:32----------
will I be fully healed and the thing is


---------97:34----------
you actually know the answer to that


---------97:35----------
will and the answer is no you're not


---------97:38----------
going to be fully healed not from that


---------97:40----------
yeah and so I feel like this picture and


---------97:47----------
the overview if it feels like it's in


---------97:49----------
capture kind of any problem I guess


---------97:51----------
and absolutely like it's an overview of


---------97:54----------
everything basically yes and this is


---------97:57----------
what the Yogi's learned they said that a


---------98:00----------
human being can be divided into these


---------98:02----------
five layers and that an attack on one


---------98:06----------
layer deserves a treatment on that same


---------98:09----------
layer and that a strong goorsha or one


---------98:14----------
strong layer can buffer or protect you


---------98:18----------
other layers so when I deal with people


---------98:20----------
with cancer right that's a gigantic


---------98:23----------
attack on the physical and the energetic


---------98:25----------
and if they are deeply spiritual people


---------98:28----------
and have a lot of emotional support they


---------98:30----------
do way better hmm


---------98:34----------
when when your grandmother so brief is


---------98:40----------
an emotional attack right it's a


---------98:43----------
different color yes it's good so grief


---------98:46----------
attacks you here and so when that


---------98:49----------
happens your physical it almost


---------98:52----------
reverberates so you get energetic damage


---------98:55----------
and you get physical damage and there's


---------98:57----------
studies that show that if someone loses


---------98:59----------
a loved one and I give them a vaccine


---------99:03----------
their immune response to the vaccine is


---------99:06----------
lower essentially vaccines become


---------99:09----------
ineffective in people who are in grief


---------99:13----------
and that's a physical effect based on an


---------99:16----------
emotional insult it's an energetic


---------99:19----------
effect based on an emotional insult when


---------99:22----------
you go to see your grandmother and she's


---------99:24----------
not there on the inside that's an


---------99:26----------
emotional blow which contributes to your


---------99:28----------
sluggishness you see that and so it's


---------99:35----------
all connected and so the cool thing is


---------99:37----------
that you can like strength in one area


---------99:39----------
and it'll kind of protect you from the


---------99:41----------
others and that's how like people this


---------99:43----------
is where resilience comes from so


---------99:46----------
somewhere in here will William I think


---------99:48----------
you're actually very strong


---------99:50----------
intellectually and that has basically


---------99:53----------
been like how you save a lot because


---------99:56----------
you've been emotionally [ __ ] you've


---------99:58----------
been I don't know if like you're


---------100:00----------
physically active or whatever maybe


---------100:01----------
you're strong physically as well but


---------100:04----------
like spiritually like you know you


---------100:06----------
something's been met missing and you've


---------100:08----------
just basically your intellect has been


---------100:10----------
like carrying the rest of your sheets


---------100:12----------
and that's why you're alive because


---------100:15----------
somewhere in there there's something


---------100:16----------
here that is like you know keeping you


---------100:19----------
going hmm


---------100:21----------
okay final questions thoughts no I'm


---------100:28----------
actually really really happy and glad


---------100:32----------
hoo-uh yeah I didn't expect too much cuz


---------100:38----------
I felt very hopeless and stuff and I


---------100:40----------
didn't expect you to even have an answer


---------100:42----------
and stuff like that but yeah well


---------100:45----------
sometimes I surprise myself it's yeah


---------100:49----------
that's that's awesome yeah III mean I


---------100:53----------
don't think I can fix you but I can give


---------100:55----------
you this so now you just think about


---------100:58----------
meditation I'm glad that I've given you


---------101:01----------
some hope which was not my intention and


---------101:04----------
for which I apologize yeah other than


---------101:11----------
that I don't know no okay so now the


---------101:21----------
question is I feel like okay so I feel


---------101:23----------
like that's sort of enough but I also


---------101:25----------
feel like I should give you the first


---------101:27----------
step in the meditation practice for how


---------101:32----------
you discover whether you deserve to be


---------101:34----------
here okay


---------101:58----------
so I have a good answer I have the


---------102:03----------
technique that I think you eventually


---------102:04----------
need I just don't know if you're ready


---------102:06----------
for it and I think the technique what


---------102:07----------
you need so I very rarely feel this way


---------102:10----------
but sometimes I'm inspired to give


---------102:12----------
someone a mantra but a mantra or mantra


---------102:15----------
is something that's usually given in a


---------102:18----------
very specific way and I feel like I know


---------102:21----------
that so sometimes when I work with


---------102:23----------
people I feel this inner sort of


---------102:25----------
inspiration that this mantra is going to


---------102:27----------
help this person I just don't know if


---------102:29----------
you're ready for it yet so let me just


---------102:31----------
think about this and let me think about


---------102:33----------
the prospect of giving a month over the


---------102:34----------
Internet and giving it to people who are


---------102:36----------
not ready for you I just have to think


---------102:39----------
through this because I thought that


---------102:41----------
holds it huh


---------102:42----------
is it cuz if not enough meditation


---------102:44----------
experience or what is it that is holding


---------102:46----------
that back I don't know if you're capable


---------102:51----------
of understanding the month right yet


---------102:53----------
because I just don't know where you are


---------102:54----------
spiritually but there's a part of me


---------102:56----------
that says that you're ready for it and


---------102:57----------
just go for it


---------102:59----------
but how if you just think about whether


---------103:01----------
I can come up with something else that


---------103:03----------
is will do the trick


---------103:16----------
hold on I'm going to get a minute okay


---------103:18----------
yeah no where's


---------103:21----------
[Music]


---------103:28----------
you


---------103:34----------
[Music]


---------103:38----------
okay we'll try this I'm not gonna I'm


---------103:42----------
gonna ask you a couple questions then


---------103:43----------
we'll just see where this I don't know


---------103:44----------
where this so I'm giving you okay so if


---------103:51----------
if we ever you know if we ever had that


---------103:54----------
have the opportunity to meet in person


---------103:55----------
William I'm gonna teach you a month or


---------103:58----------
up on that day but we never meet that


---------104:01----------
then someone else will show up and


---------104:02----------
they'll teach you what you need to know


---------104:04----------
so I want you to sit up straight you're


---------104:08----------
tall right


---------104:09----------
dad no no no you're not they would talk


---------104:12----------
no whatever


---------104:17----------
okay so just sit okay so sit up straight


---------104:21----------
round out your shoulders pull them back


---------104:22----------
a little bit go okay close your eyes and


---------104:27----------
I want you to feel your hands just feel


---------104:31----------
the presence of your hands


---------104:36----------
I'm gonna ask you a couple of questions


---------104:39----------
okay so now hold one of your hands up in


---------104:41----------
front of your face and look at it just


---------104:47----------
look at it for a second okay


---------104:52----------
see that I'm gonna ask you a question is


---------104:54----------
that you hmm what do you think yeah I


---------105:01----------
mean it's a container for me yeah it's a


---------105:06----------
container of you yes but it's not you


---------105:10----------
hmm all right so put your hand down


---------105:12----------
close your eyes so now let me ask you


---------105:15----------
something if I have a container that has


---------105:18----------
let's say I have a box and in the box is


---------105:22----------
bread is the box the same thing as the


---------105:25----------
bread no okay so now I'll ask you again


---------105:35----------
or let's just reflect for a moment so


---------105:39----------
feel your hands


---------105:46----------
and and don't touch your hands just keep


---------105:49----------
them palm face up in your lap so like


---------105:53----------
kind of like like this people watching


---------105:56----------
right so just keep them palm face off


---------105:58----------
okay or what you can do is lay your


---------106:01----------
right palm on top of your left thumb


---------106:03----------
actually do this lay your right palm on


---------106:04----------
top of your left palm and sort of make


---------106:06----------
like sort of like a circle and let it


---------106:08----------
sit in your lap let your hands rest in


---------106:10----------
your lap and I want you to ask yourself


---------106:17----------
the question are these are my hands me


---------106:27----------
actually separate your hands place them


---------106:30----------
on your lap and then ask yourself is


---------106:35----------
this me like are you your hands what do


---------106:38----------
you think


---------106:42----------
I mean I would say no okay so then guys


---------106:48----------
close good yeah now put your hands


---------106:51----------
together your right hand on top of your


---------106:53----------
left hand


---------106:54----------
let your thumbs touch so you're doing


---------106:56----------
this yeah


---------106:59----------
okay so you're you're you're basically


---------107:01----------
doing this yeah okay so now I'm gonna


---------107:07----------
have some kind of a weird question


---------107:08----------
absolutely a leading question so don't


---------107:10----------
get led just really pay attention to


---------107:12----------
yourself when your hands are together


---------107:14----------
and you form that circuit do you feel


---------107:17----------
like they're more of you yes nice


---------107:24----------
[ __ ] weird right yeah I mean I like


---------107:28----------
it's I think it's the posture with the


---------107:33----------
arms that does it a lot and like I'm


---------107:34----------
lying myself yeah yeah absolutely so now


---------107:38----------
like now here's your question okay so


---------107:40----------
what the [ __ ] is that


---------107:44----------
like that's just [ __ ] weird


---------107:46----------
now is your sense of your body being


---------107:49----------
closer to you have anything to do with


---------107:53----------
the position of your hands I mean it


---------107:58----------
felt like I just took more space and


---------108:02----------
yeah you're you're right it's just weird


---------108:06----------
right like it's weird so now here's the


---------108:10----------
question


---------108:10----------
so now close your eyes hands part feel


---------108:21----------
the disconnection of you feel that you


---------108:24----------
are not your hands okay and now I want


---------108:28----------
to so now bring your hand up in front of


---------108:30----------
you look at it and look at it now is the


---------108:37----------
hand that you see or you or less you or


---------108:40----------
the same amount of you is when you are


---------108:42----------
closing your eyes and your two hands are


---------108:44----------
in your lap


---------108:50----------
um maybe even less yeah it's [ __ ]


---------108:58----------
weird none


---------108:59----------
so I'd answer but like you're going on


---------109:02----------
you're feeling right you're not telling


---------109:03----------
me what I want to hear maybe you know I


---------109:04----------
was trying to feel what I felt on the


---------109:07----------
other arm like I was comparing what I


---------109:09----------
saw and I was comparing what I I still


---------109:11----------
had my other arm on the lap so I was


---------109:14----------
referring to those points yeah that's


---------109:17----------
Brooke that's good good innovation ok ok


---------109:19----------
so like now I'm gonna ask you question


---------109:22----------
so now we're gonna reflect okay so like


---------109:27----------
we'll be feeling closer to and further


---------109:30----------
away from what's that because you've got


---------109:34----------
a sense of something right it's like


---------109:36----------
furthest here yeah closer in your lap


---------109:39----------
and even closer when they're together


---------109:42----------
yeah it's a point we had posture as well


---------109:45----------
yep but worry what is the thing that you


---------109:50----------
are getting closer to when you do these


---------109:53----------
3 things like myself if I can explain it


---------109:58----------
yeah so what is that yeah it's you're


---------110:06----------
not supposed to answer you're not


---------110:08----------
supposed to answer so now William we so


---------110:11----------
the first meditative practice is that I


---------110:14----------
want you to become familiar with this


---------110:16----------
thing so do this practice so you can


---------110:19----------
look at your and you're already doing it


---------110:21----------
right because it's good that you're


---------110:22----------
making a comparison so you know you can


---------110:24----------
look at your hand


---------110:25----------
or you can look at your face in the


---------110:26----------
mirror and then you can close your eyes


---------110:28----------
and then try to just I don't know how


---------110:31----------
else to put this


---------110:31----------
but like move on so there's there's like


---------110:35----------
I want you to imagine a road where like


---------110:37----------
the regular world is over here in that


---------110:39----------
sense of Eunice's over here I want you


---------110:42----------
to don't even necessarily try to you


---------110:43----------
know find what is over here just learn


---------110:46----------
how to move back and forth between them


---------110:48----------
right so there's this there's this and


---------110:51----------
there's this so you can do and you can


---------110:53----------
do it by looking at yourself in the


---------110:55----------
mirror you can close your eyes in front


---------110:57----------
of a mirror and just kind of be in front


---------111:00----------
of it and then you can do this and sit


---------111:02----------
up straight and then feel that closeness


---------111:04----------
to you what when you say learn you mean


---------111:07----------
learn to have this feeling without doing


---------111:09----------
that nor I'm saying that just become


---------111:12----------
familiar with the weird idea that you


---------111:14----------
can come closer


---------111:15----------
just move further and closer away from


---------111:17----------
yourself and get familiar with that room


---------111:19----------
okay okay and now I'm gonna ask you so


---------111:22----------
now sit up straight


---------111:23----------
yeah can you sit with your legs crossed


---------111:25----------
um they are yeah oh they are oh oh but


---------111:29----------
yeah sorry like like this yes thanks


---------111:32----------
yeah now next next thing is can you put


---------111:35----------
your right heel on top of your left


---------111:38----------
thigh


---------111:39----------
can you sit like this or if you can't do


---------111:44----------
that from a flexibility standpoint don't


---------111:45----------
worry I can okay now grab your other leg


---------111:48----------
down right oh okay okay yeah don't worry


---------111:54----------
yeah so now I want you to sit like this


---------111:57----------
okay also the thumb touching each area


---------112:00----------
yeah yeah and now so relax and now feel


---------112:05----------
do you feel closer to yourself again


---------112:12----------
yeah it feels like it feels like another


---------112:16----------
part is attached thank you it's more in


---------112:20----------
the below as well yeah yeah good yep


---------112:22----------
okay so now I'm going to ask you


---------112:25----------
question William does this person does


---------112:27----------
what you feel deserve to be okay


---------112:46----------
you


---------112:47----------
I don't know her yes that's the right is


---------112:52----------
okay so now this is your practice okay


---------112:58----------
so you can just sit with this person


---------113:00----------
that you are and you're right that it


---------113:02----------
feels more attached it's cool but I


---------113:04----------
think you're doing it right so if you


---------113:06----------
guys are wondering how the Yogi's came


---------113:09----------
up with the yoga postures this is how


---------113:12----------
they did it this is where would that us


---------113:14----------
come from it's because they're able to


---------113:16----------
detect certain things about the self for


---------113:19----------
lack of a better term that facilitates


---------113:22----------
connection to the self


---------113:23----------
that's why meditative postures this is


---------113:25----------
the posture by the way that Buddha and


---------113:27----------
Shiva she was you know she was well


---------113:30----------
liked he's like one of the Hindu gods so


---------113:33----------
Shiva and Buddha use this posture this


---------113:35----------
this it's called buyer of a mudra which


---------113:39----------
means fierce or terrifying this is


---------113:43----------
actually what this would theorize means


---------113:44----------
and that's the translation by Adama so


---------113:47----------
it's it's a it's a mudra of intensity


---------113:49----------
because it brings you very intensely to


---------113:52----------
yourself and it's also kind of like


---------113:55----------
severe and it can be scary and


---------113:56----------
terrifying but yeah you're okay if


---------113:57----------
you're feeling more attached that's good


---------113:59----------
you're doing it right so you just to


---------114:00----------
play around with this man that's all you


---------114:02----------
got to do and try to find out just try


---------114:04----------
to get get man Gow you don't even have


---------114:06----------
to find out who you are or anything like


---------114:08----------
that occasionally I want you to ask the


---------114:10----------
question about whether this person


---------114:12----------
deserves to be here but you don't after


---------114:16----------
you're not necessarily looking for an


---------114:17----------
answer I don't want you to figure out


---------114:19----------
who you are any [ __ ] you know yoga


---------114:22----------
calendar spiritual stuff don't worry


---------114:25----------
about any of that I just want you to


---------114:27----------
hang out with that dude yeah for a while


---------114:31----------
do the practice I would say if you want


---------114:33----------
to sit if you can sit for like you know


---------114:35----------
I tell people to start with three to


---------114:37----------
five minutes and you've done a


---------114:38----------
remarkable amount of connection in like


---------114:41----------
less than 60 seconds so the quality of


---------114:44----------
meditation is more important than the


---------114:46----------
quantity of time that you meditate the


---------114:48----------
reason that quantity of time is


---------114:50----------
important is because you want to train


---------114:51----------
yourself for having high quality


---------114:53----------
meditation on a more often basis but 60


---------114:56----------
seconds of what you did is actually fine


---------114:58----------
if you can get there do you know what I


---------114:59----------
mean by


---------115:00----------
out there yeah yeah okay so if you can


---------115:02----------
get their grant and then ideally you


---------115:05----------
want to do this like 15 to 20 minutes


---------115:07----------
like at least three days a week ideally


---------115:09----------
even every day or five days a week or


---------115:11----------
six days a week and and just hang out


---------115:13----------
with yourself


---------115:14----------
and then you know one day we'll meet in


---------115:18----------
person I hope or someone else will meet


---------115:20----------
and if you've been doing this practice


---------115:21----------
diligently I'm gonna be able to tell and


---------115:24----------
if I can tell I'm gonna give you a


---------115:26----------
mantra oh cool


---------115:28----------
and I do you mean by you can tell though


---------115:31----------
it's the same way that I because here's


---------115:34----------
the thing William I don't know if you've


---------115:35----------
done this notice this before but


---------115:37----------
sometimes I teach people to meditate and


---------115:39----------
they have these weird experiences and


---------115:41----------
then everyone at home is like I don't


---------115:42----------
know what the [ __ ] this guy is talking


---------115:43----------
about so like I don't know how I know


---------115:46----------
how to ask you questions and teach you


---------115:49----------
practices that are gonna help you


---------115:51----------
understand something about yourself but


---------115:54----------
I just know and sometimes based on the


---------115:56----------
way that you answer me I can tell that


---------115:59----------
you're doing it right or you're doing it


---------116:00----------
wrong because what I'm asking you to do


---------116:02----------
because your words cannot translate your


---------116:05----------
experience so when you say that like


---------116:07----------
crossing your legs makes you feel more


---------116:09----------
attached I know you're doing it right I


---------116:11----------
don't even know what the [ __ ] that means


---------116:12----------
but I know it's is similar to like what


---------116:15----------
I feel and it's the whole reason that I


---------116:18----------
asked you to do it the reason I asked


---------116:21----------
you to sit that way is because I wanted


---------116:22----------
you to feel more attached but I didn't


---------116:24----------
know what to call that and that looks


---------116:27----------
like it's our time okay all right so any


---------116:31----------
last questions no I don't think so okay


---------116:37----------
say good luck to William you gonna say


---------116:42----------
good luck William no no luck for William


---------116:46----------
okay


---------116:47----------
sorry would ya


---------116:50----------
all right dude seriously though thank


---------116:52----------

---------116:54----------

---------117:36----------

---------117:38----------

---------117:45----------
okay so um I just want to go ahead and


---------117:50----------
yeah so can I say can you get going now


---------117:57----------

---------117:59----------
distracting I'm having trouble getting


---------118:01----------
