---------00:03----------
uh


---------00:03----------
call me evan that's my name okay welcome


---------00:06----------
evan


---------00:07----------
you can call me alexa okay nice to meet


---------00:10----------
you alexa and evan


---------00:11----------
so um i understand that we're gonna be


---------00:14----------
talking about your relationship today


---------00:16----------
yes okay and so let me just try to


---------00:20----------
outline a little bit


---------00:21----------
about how i usually like to do this so i


---------00:24----------
like to talk to each person individually


---------00:26----------
for like maybe 30 to 45 minutes


---------00:28----------
and get y'all's individual perspectives


---------00:31----------
because especially i understand there's


---------00:32----------
some kind of tension in y'all's


---------00:33----------
relationship


---------00:34----------
i imagine that's why we're coming on


---------00:36----------
okay um


---------00:38----------
and so we wanna hear from each of you


---------00:40----------
individually


---------00:42----------
uh and that also gives you guys kind of


---------00:44----------
a chance to


---------00:46----------
you know speak freely without the other


---------00:47----------
person there i mean i understand this is


---------00:48----------
being


---------00:49----------
recorded for the internet um so a couple


---------00:51----------
of ground rules no watching


---------00:54----------
okay so you can't watch the stream while


---------00:55----------
you're not in the room


---------00:57----------
okay um and maybe even no watching


---------01:00----------
afterward


---------01:02----------
and and then after talking to each of


---------01:04----------
you we'll kind of get you all in


---------01:06----------
together


---------01:06----------
and see if we can sort of facilitate


---------01:09----------
some kind of communication or hell


---------01:11----------
does that sound okay so who wants to go


---------01:15----------
first


---------01:17----------
you can go first babe i'll go first okay


---------01:20----------
all right


---------01:21----------
so alexa do you mind stepping out of the


---------01:23----------
room yeah no problem no


---------01:25----------
no watching


---------01:29----------
evan it looks like we have the same


---------01:30----------
chair man chairperson ah


---------01:32----------
ikea yeah oh yours has some does mine do


---------01:35----------
that


---------01:36----------
it was up and down oh wow you have a


---------01:38----------
better one


---------01:39----------
it's fancier


---------01:42----------
um so evan tell me a little bit about


---------01:44----------
why uh you know why you guys decided to


---------01:46----------
come on stream which thank you by the


---------01:47----------
way


---------01:48----------
yeah thanks for having us um i


---------01:53----------
well we recently moved


---------01:56----------
cities together uh okay it's been a


---------01:58----------
relationship for like five


---------01:59----------
years um coming up about five years


---------02:03----------
um we're 22 kind of young


---------02:07----------
and i would i wouldn't say there's a


---------02:11----------
like urgent issue that arises it's


---------02:14----------
there's much more of a sort of


---------02:17----------
passive uh background feelings i think


---------02:21----------
that we have


---------02:22----------
uh okay about it and like insecurities


---------02:25----------
and


---------02:26----------
kind of yeah the the question we posed


---------02:28----------
of


---------02:29----------
when to break up which is not something


---------02:32----------
either of us actively want


---------02:34----------
like we very much feel in love and on


---------02:37----------
our day to day is like usually very good


---------02:39----------
and uh


---------02:41----------
productive and uh okay cohesive work we


---------02:44----------
work well together we communicate well


---------02:46----------
um


---------02:47----------
but there are things that


---------02:50----------
arise over time where they're just sort


---------02:52----------
of like


---------02:53----------
no-go zones i guess um


---------02:56----------
and that's what i'm gonna put has put


---------03:00----------
like yeah


---------03:01----------
frustration in me over time because uh


---------03:06----------
and personally i am much more like


---------03:09----------
focused in on the thing once once i know


---------03:11----------
the


---------03:12----------
no go zone i get fixated with it over


---------03:15----------
time and i


---------03:16----------
okay respect it to a degree but once it


---------03:18----------
comes up i


---------03:20----------
uh it's hard for me to have any other


---------03:24----------
perspective on it than the one that we


---------03:26----------
left off on


---------03:27----------
if that sure makes sense yeah so let me


---------03:29----------
just make sure i understand you


---------03:31----------
so it sounds like there's some you know


---------03:33----------
the day-to-day interaction


---------03:35----------
in your relationship is good um it


---------03:38----------
sounds like you guys love each other


---------03:40----------
and there's some taboo topics yeah and


---------03:44----------
and so you guys sort of it sounds like


---------03:47----------
you all don't


---------03:47----------
talk about them because that usually


---------03:49----------
leads to conflict so you guys have


---------03:51----------
realized


---------03:52----------
for the sake of harmony we're going to


---------03:54----------
steer clear


---------03:55----------
of that area yeah there's there's pve


---------03:58----------
zones


---------03:59----------
and there's pvp zones yes good i like


---------04:02----------
that


---------04:03----------
and and so you're like okay we don't


---------04:04----------
want to play pvp but the problem


---------04:07----------
is that those seem to be on some level


---------04:09----------
important things and now you know that


---------04:11----------
there's like some zone that's like taboo


---------04:14----------
that issue never gets settled so it's


---------04:16----------
kind of weighing on you


---------04:18----------
yeah okay and


---------04:22----------
and it uh increases over time almost and


---------04:25----------
especially given like


---------04:26----------
the recent like moving there's uh


---------04:30----------
there's much more like on the line i


---------04:32----------
guess so those


---------04:33----------
okay can you tell us can you be a little


---------04:37----------
bit more specific so like what's an


---------04:38----------
example of a no-go zone


---------04:40----------
um i think uh


---------04:45----------
like breaking up or sort of uh


---------04:48----------
like talking about the end of something


---------04:51----------
where


---------04:52----------
they're uh


---------04:56----------
you know it's kind of what it's very


---------04:58----------
like either


---------05:00----------
together forever or it happens at some


---------05:02----------
point and


---------05:03----------
i feel a certain


---------05:06----------
like uh yeah that that bothers me i


---------05:10----------
guess um what bothers you


---------05:13----------
uh like the fact that it has to end and


---------05:16----------
go like one


---------05:17----------
way or the other um okay and


---------05:21----------
i know and i yeah like a lot every day i


---------05:23----------
can be like okay well you take it one


---------05:25----------
day at a time you


---------05:26----------
you make today a good day yada yada but


---------05:29----------
um


---------05:30----------
and like this some other like


---------05:33----------
different uh i don't want to get too


---------05:36----------
specific but different


---------05:37----------
ways we care for our mental health she


---------05:39----------
might


---------05:41----------
do something and


---------05:44----------
treat herself one way i might do it


---------05:47----------
another um


---------05:48----------
and so we're talking about self-care and


---------05:51----------
the way that you guys


---------05:52----------
differ like the way that


---------05:55----------
you know those are their differences in


---------05:57----------
the ways that you care for yourselves


---------05:59----------
yeah yeah um okay


---------06:02----------
i and where


---------06:06----------
i'll i just have an opinion on something


---------06:08----------
and i uh


---------06:09----------
think she


---------06:12----------
shouldn't and i understand this is flat


---------06:14----------
but that's not the way she should be


---------06:17----------
uh approaching the problem sort of and


---------06:20----------
i get um again like when she shouldn't


---------06:24----------
be doing something


---------06:25----------
yeah whenever the topic comes up i


---------06:29----------
stay at that stance even though i i'm


---------06:32----------
trying to be supportive and like dynamic


---------06:34----------
and see the perspectives and


---------06:36----------
just supportive of however she thinks


---------06:38----------
she needs to


---------06:39----------
i i find myself being incredibly curious


---------06:43----------
about


---------06:43----------
what you're saying and at the same time


---------06:46----------
also wanting to respect your privacy


---------06:48----------
yeah if you can give me like five


---------06:50----------
seconds sure i don't think


---------06:52----------
she'd have a problem with me mentioning


---------06:53----------
what it is but i just want to make sure


---------06:55----------
it's okay with her yep thank you


---------06:58----------
that's solid by the way


---------07:02----------
that's what we want right


---------07:09----------
all right we got the green light okay so


---------07:12----------
what are we talking about


---------07:13----------
well done by the way evan thank you yeah


---------07:16----------
i do my best um uh


---------07:20----------
antidepressants okay like she


---------07:23----------
this is not a medical stream i know that


---------07:24----------
um but


---------07:27----------
she will uh you know going through a


---------07:29----------
hard time


---------07:30----------
one of her ways of like she's on them


---------07:34----------
and particularly rough period chose to


---------07:37----------
like increase


---------07:39----------
um after and i guess my perspective on


---------07:42----------
it is


---------07:43----------
she's been on them forever for a very


---------07:46----------
long time


---------07:46----------
and i've always seen the goal as


---------07:50----------
like decreasing those like not having a


---------07:54----------
dependence or um like i think i think


---------07:58----------
things will be good for a very long


---------07:59----------
period of time but she's still taking


---------08:00----------
them and that seems


---------08:02----------
odd to me okay um so


---------08:05----------
yeah it badass okay so and and how


---------08:08----------
how do you care for yourself when you're


---------08:10----------
going through a rough time


---------08:12----------
um i i mean like any other gamer i'd say


---------08:16----------
i


---------08:17----------
i withdraw i i hide


---------08:20----------
i um yeah i have had


---------08:24----------
blessed not much lately but used to


---------08:26----------
recreationally drug use


---------08:28----------
um and generally kind of like


---------08:31----------
suppressing and uh that kind of stuff


---------08:34----------
and


---------08:34----------
sure like healthier ways of doing this i


---------08:37----------
think are


---------08:38----------
really just like talking to people i


---------08:40----------
found and having relationships


---------08:42----------
helps me a ton in processing those in a


---------08:45----------
good way instead of just not thinking


---------08:47----------
about them playing league of legends


---------08:50----------
you all noob yes


---------08:53----------
okay so it sounds like sometimes you


---------08:55----------
guys have um


---------08:57----------
kind of arguments about perspectives


---------08:59----------
around taking medication and


---------09:02----------
uh you know being dependent on


---------09:05----------
substances


---------09:06----------
um and so that's kind of one of the


---------09:09----------
no-go zones


---------09:10----------
it sounds like another no-go zone is


---------09:12----------
sort of talking about


---------09:15----------
where your relationship is going


---------09:19----------
yeah um and this ventures into


---------09:23----------
sort of uh like yeah


---------09:26----------
the the expectations of relationships


---------09:29----------
like we've always


---------09:30----------
we've always what kind of expectations


---------09:33----------
are we talking about


---------09:36----------
um like when we first started dating we


---------09:40----------
we both used this phrase that we


---------09:44----------
big picture liked each other we we like


---------09:46----------
liked each other on the big


---------09:47----------
it wasn't like just like oh you're fun


---------09:50----------
to hang out with a couple times a week


---------09:51----------
we're like no this is we


---------09:53----------
really like each other and the timing in


---------09:55----------
our lives was such that


---------09:56----------
we could uh


---------09:59----------
think on that level um and it's like


---------10:03----------
worked really well and she's in school


---------10:06----------
i'm not i just


---------10:07----------
work um and we've


---------10:10----------
chugged along with this but there is


---------10:13----------
um yeah i guess i feel like an


---------10:16----------
expectation to live up


---------10:18----------
to that me five years ago who was saying


---------10:21----------
that sometimes


---------10:22----------
and i'm sorry what were you saying


---------10:24----------
exactly


---------10:26----------
oh that like oh and


---------10:30----------
that we like big picture like each other


---------10:33----------
that we're in this for the long haul


---------10:34----------
that we know


---------10:35----------
that we may not always like each other


---------10:37----------
but we love each other sort of okay


---------10:40----------
in it for the long haul and so do you


---------10:42----------
feel


---------10:43----------
bound by making that commitment years


---------10:46----------
ago


---------10:48----------
um i feel a responsibility i feel i


---------10:51----------
guess i feel bound by that


---------10:52----------
responsibility too


---------10:53----------
and what is the responsibility um


---------10:57----------
to be there for her


---------11:01----------
and would breaking up with her mean not


---------11:03----------
being there for her


---------11:06----------
yes okay


---------11:09----------
what do you think about that


---------11:13----------
i mean and i you've got maybe uh


---------11:16----------
they it does do i have what is it


---------11:19----------
oh no because uh i imagine


---------11:23----------
i don't see it going us breaking up in a


---------11:26----------
like


---------11:26----------
peaceful we can still be friends kind of


---------11:28----------
way even though i think we're mostly


---------11:30----------
friends


---------11:30----------
more than like lovers or anything


---------11:33----------
um that i do i don't know how what that


---------11:37----------
would look like


---------11:37----------
at all to be able to support her but not


---------11:39----------
be dating


---------11:42----------
and and so i mean so evan i'm gonna say


---------11:46----------
something that may be judgmental but i'm


---------11:47----------
just gonna toss it out there okay


---------11:49----------
you gotta let me know if it's it makes


---------11:51----------
you feel bad or if it's wrong


---------11:53----------
so i'm i'm hearing that a major reason


---------11:55----------
you're in the relationship


---------11:56----------
is out of a sense of responsibility as


---------11:58----------
opposed to like wanting to be in the


---------12:00----------
relationship itself


---------12:04----------
um yeah i think that's


---------12:08----------
more my cynical view of time at


---------12:11----------
times sure well and there is


---------12:15----------
uh


---------12:18----------
like i and then there's obviously i


---------12:21----------
think


---------12:22----------
or not obviously uh i've learned


---------12:24----------
throughout time going to therapy and


---------12:26----------
things that


---------12:26----------
the value of relationships and that i


---------12:28----------
need relationships and that


---------12:30----------
they do just improve my life even if it


---------12:33----------
seems hard in the short run


---------12:34----------
um so


---------12:39----------
i uh yeah and there's


---------12:43----------
there's some other thing there of like


---------12:47----------
being too comfortable in this and like


---------12:50----------
knowing how it's going to go


---------12:52----------
and it's it's safe because it is how


---------12:55----------
it's always been for the past


---------12:57----------
while instead of the scary unknown


---------13:00----------
and how do you feel about that


---------13:04----------
um i i do


---------13:08----------
feel like i should


---------13:12----------
at times i feel like i should sacrifice


---------13:14----------
what i have


---------13:15----------
like the comfort that i have um to to


---------13:18----------
get something better


---------13:19----------
i guess is the idea that i hear a lot um


---------13:24----------
but also at the same time when i think


---------13:26----------
of what that actually looks like


---------13:27----------
and actually going through that it


---------13:30----------
doesn't feel like something i want


---------13:31----------
i i feel like it would be a mistake


---------13:35----------
okay


---------13:38----------
can i think for a second please


---------14:01----------
thank you


---------14:17----------
okay here's what i'm hearing


---------14:20----------
so it sounds like your relationship is


---------14:22----------
good for a lot of reasons


---------14:24----------
um you know it sounds like you guys have


---------14:26----------
been together for five years and you


---------14:28----------
said you're


---------14:28----------
22 so you guys got together when you


---------14:30----------
were 17. yep


---------14:32----------
um you know early on y'all were very


---------14:35----------
much in love and it sounds like y'all


---------14:36----------
are still in love


---------14:38----------
and you made kind of as 17 year olds do


---------14:42----------
broad commitments we're gonna do it for


---------14:44----------
the rest of our life


---------14:47----------
um you also recognize and so years have


---------14:50----------
gone on you guys have gotten through a


---------14:51----------
lot together you've moved in together


---------14:54----------
uh you know like any relationship you


---------14:56----------
guys have your challenges but i'm


---------14:57----------
hearing that there's a lot of good stuff


---------14:59----------
there


---------15:00----------
i'm hearing that for your own stability


---------15:04----------
that being in a relationship is


---------15:06----------
important i'm hearing that the


---------15:07----------
relationship has become


---------15:09----------
comfortable safe dependable


---------15:14----------
maybe there's more i'm getting the sense


---------15:16----------
that something is missing from your


---------15:17----------
relationship


---------15:20----------
i'm not sure exactly what that is maybe


---------15:23----------
there is something missing maybe there


---------15:24----------
isn't


---------15:25----------
we can get to that in a second but


---------15:27----------
overall it seems like the relationship


---------15:29----------
is good it sounds like


---------15:30----------
alexa is a is uh maybe your best friend


---------15:36----------
and and so you know there's a lot of


---------15:38----------
good stuff there


---------15:41----------
what i'm hearing from you evan is a butt


---------15:45----------
but so like if we think about life


---------15:48----------
do we want to choose the road that's


---------15:49----------
safe


---------15:51----------
there's a there's a path of certainty


---------15:54----------
and safety


---------15:55----------
and there's a path of uncertainty


---------15:58----------
there's a path there's like a risk like


---------16:00----------
a high risk and a low risk option


---------16:03----------
and what i'm hearing you kind of


---------16:04----------
struggle with is like how do you know


---------16:07----------
when you should do something that like


---------16:10----------
you kind of know is good for you


---------16:11----------
versus how do you grow


---------16:15----------
because what i'm really hearing from you


---------16:16----------
is that like you're not growing in this


---------16:18----------
relationship anymore


---------16:20----------
yes i think that's very accurate


---------16:24----------
right and and that's tricky because like


---------16:26----------
how much of this relationship


---------16:28----------
sure i mean this is what i envision it's


---------16:30----------
kind of like


---------16:31----------
you know there's the waters around our


---------16:33----------
island which we know well and which are


---------16:35----------
safe


---------16:36----------
but at what point do you decide to like


---------16:39----------
pack as much food as you can


---------16:40----------
into your boat and sail into the horizon


---------16:43----------
and see what you can find


---------16:46----------
is that how you feel yeah yeah um


---------16:51----------
and especially with another person


---------16:54----------
involved the the decision gets like


---------16:58----------
muddied very quickly because how does


---------17:00----------
another person muddy the decision


---------17:03----------
i mean it's uh


---------17:06----------
i feel that i should take her feelings


---------17:10----------
into account right i feel like


---------17:12----------
uh even i need to venture off into


---------17:15----------
uncertainty


---------17:16----------
and i'm like well there's plenty of


---------17:18----------
other ways i can do that that doesn't


---------17:19----------
necessarily mean


---------17:20----------
like ending this relationship you can


---------17:22----------
install dota for example yeah exactly


---------17:24----------
yeah i just started playing


---------17:24----------
counter-strike and that's


---------17:26----------
i'm like a new new way to waste my time


---------17:28----------
cool um


---------17:30----------
but there's yes sorry i lost a point


---------17:33----------
no i mean so you were saying that when


---------17:35----------
another person gets involved it gets


---------17:36----------
complicated so like how like so


---------17:38----------
how does taking her feelings into


---------17:40----------
account how does that complicate things


---------17:43----------
um well i'd say because


---------17:46----------
there's there's no like one to one on


---------17:50----------
my feeling versus your feeling like


---------17:54----------
in obviously one one individual another


---------17:56----------
individual


---------17:57----------
but the like levels of feeling and the


---------18:00----------
attachments and the like need for


---------18:04----------
someone else at a certain time and it um


---------18:07----------
the like specificity of


---------18:12----------
thinking about uh like


---------18:15----------
changing things up gets okay


---------18:18----------
overwhelming


---------18:19----------
okay so so so what i'm hearing is that


---------18:22----------
the details of


---------18:24----------
how you go off sailing into the sunset


---------18:26----------
become really complicated when you have


---------18:27----------
to think about someone else


---------18:29----------
yeah yeah and especially the i think the


---------18:31----------
feelings


---------18:33----------
have arose at this time which feelings


---------18:36----------
uh those the feelings of


---------18:39----------
uncertainty and um


---------18:44----------
like almost like lost possibilities


---------18:47----------
like that i'm like yeah committed on


---------18:51----------
a path now of some certainty having


---------18:54----------
like moved in together in a new city


---------19:02----------
how does it feel to have lost those


---------19:03----------
possibilities


---------19:07----------
um it's


---------19:10----------
it like it it hurts it hurts my


---------19:14----------
ego or something inside of me where it i


---------19:17----------
i want to like do a lot whatever that


---------19:20----------
means


---------19:20----------
um and


---------19:25----------
like i have yeah friends who have done


---------19:28----------
things for the same period of time that


---------19:30----------
i've like been in this relationship and


---------19:32----------
i


---------19:33----------
almost do one-to-one compare those


---------19:34----------
things where i'm like well they have


---------19:36----------
this degree or this project or this like


---------19:39----------
organization going and i


---------19:41----------
have a relationship cool


---------19:44----------
yeah i'm a little bit um help me


---------19:47----------
understand


---------19:48----------
what how


---------19:51----------
the relationship interferes with let's


---------19:54----------
say


---------19:55----------
having a degree or a project


---------19:59----------
uh


---------20:03----------
right i think yeah yeah i think and


---------20:06----------
maybe i'm


---------20:06----------
getting too abstract but i think it is


---------20:09----------
like an identity thing


---------20:10----------
of feeling some tie


---------20:13----------
to be a similar person to who i was when


---------20:17----------
this started what does that mean


---------20:22----------
um like i remember the time we met


---------20:25----------
it was last year of high school


---------20:29----------
and i was like nope not going to college


---------20:31----------
i'm going to


---------20:33----------
i'm gonna work i worked at a restaurant


---------20:34----------
and i'm independent it's very


---------20:36----------
like i'm gonna read books and


---------20:39----------
philosophize on my own and like


---------20:41----------
be this uh individual and


---------20:45----------
i like that voice you did when


---------20:53----------
um and yeah i guess


---------20:57----------
i just i guess i'm not


---------21:00----------
yet sure why i feel like there's less


---------21:06----------
or less yeah opportunities available to


---------21:08----------
me but i do feel like there's less


---------21:09----------
opportunities available to me because


---------21:11----------
i'm in this okay okay


---------21:18----------
okay


---------21:21----------
so you sound to me like you're feeling


---------21:24----------
like you're stagnating or shackled in


---------21:26----------
some way


---------21:29----------
i wouldn't use those words but yes the


---------21:31----------
feeling is yes


---------21:33----------
yeah so what words would you use


---------21:37----------
um i mean i would say


---------21:40----------
uh stuck or um


---------21:43----------
kind of dormant oh dormant is a good one


---------21:48----------
ooh i like that one i'm gonna have to


---------21:50----------
start using that one more


---------21:52----------
so much more positive than stuck yes i'm


---------21:55----------
i think i'm i'm very good because you're


---------21:57----------
reading


---------21:58----------
philosophy books on your own


---------22:01----------
um okay and and so can you help me


---------22:04----------
understand like


---------22:05----------
what happens when you go into a no-go


---------22:07----------
zone


---------22:08----------
when you switch from co-op to versus


---------22:11----------
yeah


---------22:13----------
it is like it's almost as if the lights


---------22:16----------
change


---------22:16----------
and the like spotlight comes down on us


---------22:19----------
and


---------22:20----------
um the i mean what it literally is is


---------22:24----------
very much like


---------22:27----------
attention arises and


---------22:31----------
we both are sort of


---------22:34----------
usually not saying anything because we


---------22:36----------
both know


---------22:38----------
the space that we're going to be


---------22:40----------
entering we both know like


---------22:41----------
the scripts that we usually go down


---------22:43----------
which is like okay


---------22:46----------
why like yeah why did you increase that


---------22:48----------
or like well


---------22:50----------
you're gonna have to go down like so


---------22:51----------
you're gonna be on it forever you know


---------22:52----------
like this


---------22:53----------
those kind of things um and


---------22:56----------
very much waiting for someone to make a


---------22:59----------
move


---------22:59----------
and sort of and then maybe like guys


---------23:02----------
circling each other yeah you like maybe


---------23:05----------
like provoke them and you're like hello


---------23:06----------
like


---------23:07----------
hello you know you try to get them to


---------23:09----------
come out a bit


---------23:10----------
um make them to make the first move so


---------23:12----------
you can counter attack


---------23:13----------
exactly yeah no we always we're and


---------23:15----------
we're both like so


---------23:17----------
argumentative people so it's a lot of


---------23:20----------
posturing


---------23:21----------
but not it doesn't um


---------23:25----------
we we have like engaged and


---------23:29----------
had like large fights and crying and


---------23:31----------
everything


---------23:32----------
what isn't how does how do you guys have


---------23:34----------
a large fight what does that look like


---------23:37----------
um


---------23:40----------
i mean it is mostly talking i don't


---------23:43----------
raise our voices not too much we're not


---------23:45----------
big yellers and


---------23:48----------
violent people but like what gets set


---------23:50----------
like what is an actual argument like if


---------23:52----------
i were to watch


---------23:53----------
this for five minutes what would it look


---------23:55----------
like


---------23:57----------
um it would look like me sitting


---------24:01----------
like a armchair philosopher philosophers


---------24:03----------
kind of like trying to


---------24:05----------
as if i do have the divine knowledge of


---------24:08----------
what is what should and shouldn't be


---------24:10----------
done um


---------24:12----------
her much more like fidgeting or she is


---------24:15----------
much more likely to like get up and


---------24:17----------
leave like either to a different room or


---------24:19----------
the house or


---------24:20----------
um take the dog for a walk or something


---------24:23----------
and


---------24:25----------
um i think she


---------24:29----------
is much more like expressive and i


---------24:32----------
i call her out for calling me names


---------24:34----------
often even though


---------24:36----------
the names probably are fitting at times


---------24:39----------
um


---------24:39----------
what does she say oh just like [ __ ]


---------24:42----------
jerk


---------24:43----------
uh okay douche you know um


---------24:47----------
thing and because it yeah and it is like


---------24:49----------
i'm


---------24:50----------
trying to maintain and what what are you


---------24:52----------
doing that mate that


---------24:53----------
makes [ __ ] warranted um


---------24:56----------
[Music]


---------24:58----------
acting as if i know the answer i'd say


---------25:00----------
but you feel like you know the answer in


---------25:02----------
those moments


---------25:03----------
yes yes which is why it's


---------25:06----------
frustrating you know it's interesting


---------25:08----------
because what i'm what i'm


---------25:10----------
envisioning is almost like a courtroom


---------25:12----------
where you're the judge


---------25:14----------
that's what it feels like to me yeah no


---------25:17----------
like


---------25:18----------
like she's sitting down there and you're


---------25:20----------
sitting up there in your arm chair


---------25:23----------
and relatively theatrical saying yes


---------25:27----------
making the final judgment yep and i


---------25:30----------
and i that's also kind of thing is i


---------25:35----------
like retrospectively or reflectively uh


---------25:37----------
don't like


---------25:38----------
that version of myself that like is


---------25:41----------
trying to be more powerful


---------25:43----------
than her in some way that's trying to


---------25:45----------
like


---------25:46----------
maintain control and like embarrass her


---------25:50----------
or something yeah where does that


---------25:52----------
version of yourself come from


---------25:56----------
um


---------26:02----------
i


---------26:06----------
i'd say i'm uh i'm a youngest


---------26:10----------
of i have three older sisters which uh


---------26:14----------
helps i helps in just like communicating


---------26:16----------
with her but


---------26:18----------
um i have always been like a very


---------26:22----------
reserved they all talk and discuss and


---------26:26----------
i'm much more


---------26:26----------
like sit there and then add a joke at


---------26:29----------
the end or add a comment kind of thing


---------26:31----------
um sort of observational


---------26:35----------
nature i'd say okay let me actually ask


---------26:39----------
you kind of


---------26:39----------
one or two other questions if that's


---------26:41----------
okay i'm going to switch gears for a


---------26:42----------
second


---------26:43----------
can you tell me what uh the no-go zone


---------26:45----------
of talking about y'all's relationship


---------26:47----------
looks like


---------26:48----------
how does that conversation go


---------26:53----------
like breaking up yep um


---------26:59----------
it's


---------27:04----------
uh very that's much more like


---------27:08----------
sad it's much more like


---------27:11----------
crying in bed like holding each other


---------27:14----------
kind of like


---------27:15----------
a supportive like less of an argument


---------27:19----------
and more of a


---------27:20----------
like um joint feeling


---------27:24----------
how do you guys get there that's what


---------27:26----------
i'm like okay


---------27:27----------
you know like how was work today it was


---------27:29----------
good do you want to get into bed and cry


---------27:31----------
while we hold each other


---------27:35----------
that's only on the weekends um


---------27:39----------
uh you got a very funny one very funny


---------27:43----------
thank you thank you um


---------27:48----------
there's usually some yeah you obviously


---------27:51----------
have some sort of


---------27:51----------
trigger from yes um and usually i think


---------27:54----------
it's pretty variable it's not we're not


---------27:56----------
usually


---------27:57----------
based on any tell me the last time that


---------28:00----------
you guys wound up in bed


---------28:02----------
crying together and how that


---------28:03----------
conversation started um


---------28:05----------
[Music]


---------28:07----------
i think i i brought up the


---------28:11----------
like what initiated it all was like i


---------28:15----------
my feeling was that we're


---------28:18----------
too much friends that like


---------28:21----------
i feel like we're roommates almost okay


---------28:26----------
and so what that was the feeling what


---------28:28----------
happened


---------28:30----------
uh i i mean i brought that i think she


---------28:33----------
her


---------28:34----------
initial response was kind of so you said


---------28:37----------
to her


---------28:38----------
i feel like we're roommates yeah


---------28:41----------
okay she said back like um


---------28:44----------
what do you mean like is this like a


---------28:48----------
do you mean like is it not enough


---------28:51----------
like together time doing things uh like


---------28:55----------
kind of inquiring more and i said i i


---------28:59----------
i reply that it's just much more of a


---------29:01----------
feeling of


---------29:03----------
the whole relationship you know i kind


---------29:04----------
of drop a


---------29:07----------
yeah it's kind of a more of


---------29:12----------
try yeah i guess just expressing my


---------29:14----------
feeling instead of um


---------29:15----------
right doing anything and then she'll say


---------29:18----------
like so


---------29:19----------
what do you mean by that like so what


---------29:22----------
can i do


---------29:23----------
she you know she kind of looks trying to


---------29:24----------
do and i said there's like and then


---------29:26----------
maybe i'll like throw some things out


---------29:28----------
there but


---------29:29----------
um she'll


---------29:35----------
talk or she'll start going on uh


---------29:39----------
like bringing things up from the past of


---------29:42----------
like


---------29:42----------
instances where we were


---------29:46----------
like good or bad in like


---------29:49----------
or we were good friends or we were like


---------29:52----------
not


---------29:52----------
good friends or um


---------29:55----------
and so i think stressed


---------29:59----------
refute your point yeah


---------30:03----------
yeah like sort of give me her


---------30:07----------
the things that come to her mind of like


---------30:09----------
why that's clearly not the case


---------30:11----------
and why from like her perspective


---------30:13----------
obviously not friends because


---------30:14----------
friends wouldn't do this or that um i


---------30:17----------
just thought there's


---------30:18----------
a higher tier of relationship to it um


---------30:22----------
and i think it's like there


---------30:25----------
that like my feeling


---------30:29----------
versus her facts um


---------30:33----------
sort of just like saddens us because i'm


---------30:36----------
i'm like well i have this like this is


---------30:38----------
all i have to offer


---------30:40----------
to you um and she's like well i was


---------30:43----------
living in this world and now you're


---------30:44----------
telling me that you were living in this


---------30:46----------
world


---------30:47----------
um and that like we both want


---------30:51----------
we both want like and then kind of like


---------30:53----------
the presupposition of wanting to be


---------30:55----------
together is never in question it's


---------30:56----------
always


---------30:58----------
just like then it just gets very sad


---------31:01----------
because


---------31:02----------
we feel like that's yeah


---------31:05----------
crumbling in some way what's crumb


---------31:10----------
um our love or like our


---------31:14----------
uh understanding of each other our


---------31:16----------
ability to relate


---------31:23----------
okay and help me understand


---------31:27----------
a little bit about what your perspective


---------31:29----------
is on antidepressants


---------31:32----------
and it's um


---------31:35----------
i mean you don't have to i would


---------31:36----------
encourage you to not worry about


---------31:38----------
judgment uh although i imagine that can


---------31:42----------
be hard


---------31:43----------
but generally speaking i just genuinely


---------31:44----------
because i think understanding how you


---------31:46----------
feel about things


---------31:48----------
um kind of is very important without


---------31:51----------
judgment yeah um


---------31:55----------
so i guess i'll start with my experience


---------31:57----------
of antidepressants um


---------31:59----------
which was very much i mean it was i was


---------32:03----------
a depressed gamer doing depressed gamer


---------32:05----------
things


---------32:06----------
um right off and the i feel like my the


---------32:11----------
antidepressants at the time


---------32:12----------
almost blurred everything more where it


---------32:15----------
was


---------32:15----------
just like a more monotone existence of


---------32:18----------
what i was


---------32:19----------
already doing um very like yeah the


---------32:22----------
dulling effect


---------32:24----------
i think i was taking i took two or three


---------32:26----------
different of the most common


---------32:28----------
varieties um and


---------32:32----------
then like yeah went through a few mental


---------32:35----------
health institutions they were


---------32:36----------
throwing the kitchen sink at me and


---------32:38----------
everything and i think


---------32:42----------
i came out the other end still having a


---------32:44----------
feeling but also having like a


---------32:45----------
confidence


---------32:46----------
what i gained from all of that was not


---------32:48----------
like a prescription


---------32:50----------
or um a diagnosis or anything but it was


---------32:54----------
like a confidence


---------32:55----------
in myself to like okay well none of


---------32:58----------
these


---------32:58----------
idiots could do it none of these drugs


---------33:01----------
actually did anything


---------33:03----------
um but like i am the one who can


---------33:06----------
choose to do stuff and like make a life


---------33:08----------
i want or whatever um


---------33:11----------
and yeah i guess


---------33:14----------
i just see them very much as a crutch


---------33:16----------
and as a way of


---------33:17----------
lifting the bottom


---------33:21----------
up to a place where they can start to be


---------33:24----------
helped


---------33:24----------
like because there is there is a bottom


---------33:27----------
that


---------33:28----------
i've been at and i i've seen people at


---------33:29----------
where like yeah you just need more


---------33:32----------
uh serotonin and you need more dopamine


---------33:35----------
or whatever


---------33:36----------
and when


---------33:39----------
we like are on trips and like there's


---------33:43----------
months and months and months where


---------33:44----------
everything is like fantastic it's


---------33:47----------
like it i like i think i like to think


---------33:49----------
that i'm very


---------33:50----------
mindful of like what i eat and what i


---------33:52----------
put in my body and


---------33:55----------
the idea of like taking something that


---------33:58----------
makes you feel better while like


---------34:01----------
everything is good around you


---------34:02----------
seems uh drone-ish to me


---------34:06----------
seems very like just doing what you


---------34:09----------
are supposed to okay or what what the


---------34:12----------
doctor ordered


---------34:14----------
which is not i guess in authority i


---------34:16----------
necessarily


---------34:18----------
okay


---------34:21----------
okay so i'm detecting


---------34:25----------
you know something of your independence


---------34:27----------
streak coming up here too


---------34:30----------
right this idea that i'm going to study


---------34:32----------
philosophy on my own to be independent


---------34:34----------
and [ __ ] the doctors the establishment


---------34:37----------
and i don't want to be a drone


---------34:38----------
yes exactly very much cool


---------34:42----------
so what goes through your mind when you


---------34:45----------
see


---------34:47----------
alexa upping her dose and does she up it


---------34:50----------
herself or her


---------34:51----------
doctor tells her to increase


---------34:54----------
i mean the most recent one and


---------34:57----------
why this is relevant was her


---------35:01----------
reaching out for it um which


---------35:06----------
yeah aggravated me more than if it was


---------35:09----------
just a doctor telling her because i


---------35:10----------
understand just


---------35:11----------
what aggravates you about her reaching


---------35:13----------
out to her doctor


---------35:15----------
um well i thought the like


---------35:19----------
there was clear indicators during the


---------35:22----------
time period where she was feeling worse


---------35:24----------
like she was just spending a lot of time


---------35:25----------
with her family who really stresses her


---------35:27----------
out and trains her and asks a lot of her


---------35:30----------
um and


---------35:33----------
not like we moved but she had to leave


---------35:35----------
town to go help them


---------35:36----------
for a while and not having a home and


---------35:38----------
there's so many


---------35:40----------
more circumstantial things to me that


---------35:44----------
that seems like just a random


---------35:47----------
like it it'd be like


---------35:52----------
uh it's like


---------35:56----------
taking uh or


---------36:00----------
it's just not it doesn't seem like a


---------36:02----------
relevant um level


---------36:04----------
to be adjusting it doesn't seem like a


---------36:05----------
skill you need to be


---------36:07----------
boosting right now it's to me it's just


---------36:09----------
kind of a


---------36:10----------
uh you're only like increasing the like


---------36:13----------
dependence


---------36:14----------
okay when you could very much just like


---------36:18----------
take some time reorient yourself and


---------36:21----------
um start from there because


---------36:25----------
i get and i guess this always like i


---------36:27----------
have some idea that


---------36:28----------
the goal is to be off of them and okay i


---------36:31----------
see that as a


---------36:32----------
like a step in the wrong direction yeah


---------36:35----------
yeah


---------36:36----------
evan do you feel like alexa understands


---------36:38----------
you


---------36:41----------
um i think she understands me the best


---------36:43----------
of anyone


---------36:44----------
i i think i won't i'll give you the


---------36:47----------
short


---------36:47----------
version of like i


---------36:52----------
grew up not feeling very understood by


---------36:54----------
my mom


---------36:55----------
uh my parents were divorced and we did


---------36:58----------
like a week at one house week at the


---------36:59----------
other house and


---------37:01----------
i felt like my dad understood me very


---------37:03----------
well but my mom totally didn't


---------37:05----------
um and there's this eternal like


---------37:08----------
hiding from people presenting a certain


---------37:11----------
facade


---------37:12----------
um to like everyone most of the time


---------37:16----------
and in order to uh


---------37:20----------
protect myself i guess or something okay


---------37:23----------
and


---------37:25----------
i i think she understands


---------37:29----------
a lot of me but almost that that almost


---------37:31----------
um


---------37:33----------
when she says things that imply that she


---------37:35----------
understands what i'm going through


---------37:37----------
that almost angers me because i


---------37:41----------
i'm like no you don't actually get it


---------37:43----------
like this is actually an everything i'm


---------37:44----------
gonna ask you again


---------37:46----------
does she understand you


---------37:54----------
uh not entirely okay


---------38:02----------
okay


---------38:05----------
so


---------38:10----------
is this relationship safe for you


---------38:15----------
i feel safe in it is this relationship


---------38:18----------
good for you


---------38:22----------
that's the question that's that's


---------38:25----------
yeah what i've felt both sides


---------38:29----------
of that okay


---------38:33----------
do you want to be in this relationship


---------38:38----------
um i feel like i want to i guess


---------38:42----------
i think that ties into um


---------38:45----------
whether it's good for me


---------38:49----------
i feel like i want things that are good


---------38:51----------
for me um


---------38:52----------
so i want to be in it but i also don't


---------38:56----------
want to be doing things that are bad for


---------38:58----------
me


---------38:58----------
okay are you afraid that


---------39:02----------
if you are in this relationship


---------39:07----------
you won't live the life that you're


---------39:09----------
supposed to live


---------39:12----------
yes okay so i think that's the crux of


---------39:17----------
it


---------39:17----------
is what i'm getting from you is that


---------39:19----------
fair to say


---------39:20----------
yeah okay any questions for me


---------39:26----------
why is it what's what's up with the


---------39:28----------
chairs today behind you


---------39:30----------
you've chaired behind you yeah um i


---------39:32----------
think that


---------39:34----------
you know i'm we're still sort of moving


---------39:35----------
in so i also have a couple of boxes that


---------39:38----------
need to be cleared out


---------39:39----------
okay and so yeah i mean it's just


---------39:43----------
more furniture in my office


---------39:46----------
nothing no no no no other questions


---------39:48----------
regarding my results yeah


---------39:50----------
um yeah so i i think i've kind of heard


---------39:53----------
uh i think you've done an awesome job of


---------39:56----------
kind of representing what you're going


---------39:57----------
through


---------39:58----------
um and you know i


---------40:01----------
i think i i feel like i'm ready to kind


---------40:03----------
of get some of alexis perspective


---------40:05----------
and i also want to make sure that we


---------40:06----------
have enough time to talk to the two of


---------40:08----------
you together


---------40:09----------
so if there's something that is there


---------40:10----------
anything that you feel like we didn't


---------40:12----------
cover


---------40:12----------
or left out or sort of didn't get to


---------40:14----------
that you want to share


---------40:16----------
um


---------40:20----------
i don't want to spend much time on it


---------40:22----------
but uh


---------40:24----------
the i guess i'd say


---------40:28----------
like being a gamer dating a non-gamer um


---------40:32----------
is a interesting thing and um


---------40:36----------
that like i


---------40:39----------
i was generic twitch chat user


---------40:43----------
um and at a certain point


---------40:47----------
um like nothing changed i just i just


---------40:50----------
fell into this relationship


---------40:52----------
and i still feel that way and i guess


---------40:55----------
more so i'm just saying like to


---------40:58----------
everybody that


---------40:58----------
it uh it yeah being in a relationship


---------41:02----------
isn't like isn't


---------41:03----------
fixing anything it isn't going to fix


---------41:05----------
you


---------41:06----------
inherently like the the eunice is still


---------41:08----------
there for sure


---------41:10----------
okay okay cool can you


---------41:13----------
call alexa in yes


---------41:16----------
thank you very much thank you


---------41:21----------
so any takers on the idea that the


---------41:24----------
reason that he's not moving forward in


---------41:26----------
life is gonna be because he plays two


---------41:28----------
video too many video games from alexa's


---------41:32----------
perspective


---------41:34----------
because he didn't really talk about the


---------41:35----------
video games i'm curious whether we're


---------41:36----------
going to see video games


---------41:43----------
hey i guess you can't can't hear me


---------41:51----------
hey alexa hello did i get a good review


---------41:55----------
uh yeah i don't think uh oddly enough we


---------41:57----------
didn't really talk much about


---------41:59----------
oh imagine that um


---------42:02----------
but uh okay so can you tell me a little


---------42:05----------
bit about


---------42:05----------
your understanding of why we're talking


---------42:07----------
today uh


---------42:09----------
yeah so um


---------42:13----------
okay well i think this like starts with


---------42:16----------
the fact that like evan and i live very


---------42:17----------
different lives


---------42:18----------
but we're together because we have


---------42:20----------
similar values and morals and


---------42:22----------
we obviously like care about each other


---------42:24----------
and we love each other very much


---------42:26----------
um but i think there is this like


---------42:30----------
looming idea that um


---------42:34----------
since because we live or because we live


---------42:36----------
such different lives


---------42:37----------
um perhaps we aren't compatible for a


---------42:41----------
long term


---------42:42----------
um i know like when we started dating


---------42:44----------
people always made like comments about


---------42:46----------
how different we were and like both of


---------42:48----------
our families did


---------42:50----------
um yeah and i guess


---------42:53----------
like me a data point of why i think this


---------42:56----------
is a problem


---------42:57----------
is um so like we love each other but we


---------43:01----------
will have like moments of like very


---------43:03----------
intense and


---------43:04----------
city towards one another which i think


---------43:06----------
is like common


---------43:07----------
in relationships but um


---------43:11----------
yeah we can't ever really like talk


---------43:12----------
through these things


---------43:14----------
so like if like i guess this happens a


---------43:17----------
lot like


---------43:18----------
i'll be talking too loudly in a


---------43:20----------
restaurant and like it is probably too


---------43:22----------
loudly


---------43:22----------
and i'm like hey be quiet and i'll just


---------43:24----------
be like why are you telling me what to


---------43:26----------
do like leave me alone


---------43:27----------
and then we just like don't talk like


---------43:31----------
for like the remainder of dinner or


---------43:33----------
whatever so it's weird


---------43:34----------
because we communicate so well together


---------43:36----------
most of the time but we just can't get


---------43:38----------
over these incidences


---------43:40----------
that i think are tied to our long-term


---------43:43----------
looming questions of compatibility


---------43:46----------
okay can you give us that was a great


---------43:48----------
example can you give us another example


---------43:50----------
of how


---------43:52----------
animosity develops between you two um


---------43:55----------
yeah okay like so many to choose from


---------43:59----------
[Laughter]


---------44:02----------
um okay let's


---------44:05----------
okay this is a good one um so like


---------44:08----------
i feel like definitely previous before


---------44:12----------
quarantine


---------44:13----------
i like come and go a lot and


---------44:17----------
i like like to be busy probably


---------44:20----------
to a fault i always like to be doing


---------44:22----------
something be out of the house like


---------44:24----------
rarely find me just chilling um and i'd


---------44:27----------
be like bopping in and out of the house


---------44:28----------
and evan would be like playing games


---------44:30----------
and i just kind of like wait in the


---------44:32----------
kitchen to say hi or like pop my head in


---------44:35----------
um and like stand in the kitchen or


---------44:36----------
something kind of like


---------44:38----------
waiting i don't know and i think he


---------44:42----------
feels just


---------44:42----------
like i think he internalizes that like


---------44:44----------
maybe he's playing video games too long


---------44:47----------
but i think i genuinely don't care uh


---------44:50----------
because i realize i just fill my time by


---------44:53----------
probably some negative way being too


---------44:54----------
busy and he fills his time


---------44:56----------
playing video games i think in a similar


---------44:58----------
way but


---------44:59----------
then he'll come out and be like there's


---------45:01----------
just like this weird mood


---------45:03----------
that like we aren't really like we're


---------45:06----------
talking around each other instead of


---------45:08----------
talking at each other um then it's like


---------45:12----------
i think sometimes evan is like quick to


---------45:14----------
um


---------45:15----------
react quicker than i am and then


---------45:19----------
i'm like well i'll meet you there i just


---------45:21----------
won't talk to you like


---------45:23----------
and this very adaptive behavior what do


---------45:25----------
you mean made him where


---------45:27----------
like at his like crappy mood he's like


---------45:30----------
quick to react nature and when you say


---------45:34----------
you're talking you're kind of circling


---------45:35----------
around something what are you all


---------45:36----------
circling around


---------45:38----------
each other which is probably the problem


---------45:40----------
um


---------45:42----------
like okay peanut yeah so so this is


---------45:45----------
really helpful and i'm missing i'm


---------45:47----------
losing you somewhere or i'm i'm losing


---------45:49----------
track


---------45:50----------
so i kind of get that okay so it sounds


---------45:51----------
like you kind of pop home like you're


---------45:53----------
doing something you kind of come home


---------45:55----------
he's gaming so you're like


---------45:57----------
i don't know why i would sit around so


---------45:59----------
then you leave again


---------46:01----------
you do something for a little while you


---------46:03----------
come back yeah and then


---------46:05----------
what is how do you guys start to circle


---------46:08----------
or


---------46:08----------
interact because it sounds like


---------46:09----------
somewhere in there a foul mood is


---------46:11----------
brewing


---------46:12----------
yeah yeah and i think that's the problem


---------46:14----------
is like we don't know where it starts


---------46:17----------
and um so like i would be standing in


---------46:20----------
the kitchen


---------46:21----------
like making lunch or something and he


---------46:23----------
would come out and be like


---------46:24----------
hey babe how are you doing i'm like good


---------46:27----------
how are you


---------46:28----------
like good and then


---------46:31----------
both just like look at each other and


---------46:33----------
then


---------46:34----------
it's almost like i feel unwelcome


---------46:38----------
so like i give him like the cola


---------46:41----------
shoulder


---------46:42----------
or like negative body language


---------46:46----------
um or will like what


---------46:49----------
what kind of thoughts do you have about


---------46:51----------
him


---------46:53----------
uh like in those moments yeah


---------46:56----------
um i think i react so negatively


---------47:01----------
to that because i feel like perhaps i'm


---------47:04----------
being judged for


---------47:06----------
the busy nature in which i live my life


---------47:10----------
and um let's see


---------47:13----------
uh probably also that


---------47:17----------
i would like to come home and be like


---------47:20----------
a warmly embraced


---------47:24----------
yeah and i know like


---------47:27----------
logically like he's in the middle of a


---------47:30----------
game he can't come up


---------47:31----------
and i know i'm his priority in his life


---------47:33----------
but like in those moments i can't be the


---------47:35----------
priority


---------47:36----------
so these are things i logically know but


---------47:39----------
somewhere along the line


---------47:42----------
okay judge for the busy nature


---------47:45----------
of your life do you feel judged for the


---------47:48----------
busy nature of your life


---------47:52----------
i think um


---------47:57----------
i before i started dating evan i thought


---------47:59----------
of this as like a positive


---------48:01----------
characteristic that i would never stop


---------48:04----------
um but i am becoming more and more aware


---------48:07----------
of how i


---------48:08----------
use my


---------48:11----------
like enjoyment of being busy as a way to


---------48:13----------
not deal with my issues


---------48:15----------
so um when i


---------48:18----------
am around evan who lives a very like


---------48:21----------
quiet life i think


---------48:23----------
he doesn't like i find joy like going


---------48:26----------
out of the house and doing things and he


---------48:27----------
just doesn't


---------48:28----------
so i think it's like my lifestyle is


---------48:32----------
juxtaposed to his very staunchly in


---------48:33----------
those moments


---------48:37----------
so what do you use your busy lifestyle


---------48:39----------
as a coping mechanism for


---------48:42----------
um


---------48:45----------
well i think um i think that if i'm busy


---------48:49----------
i have like no time to not be okay


---------48:52----------
or to like not be um


---------48:57----------
like if i'm busy i can't process my


---------48:59----------
emotions i can just like


---------49:00----------
file them and then


---------49:03----------
like obviously this is a problem when


---------49:06----------
i'm not busy


---------49:06----------
then like everything's comes like


---------49:08----------
crashing to the ground


---------49:10----------
and what kind of stuff comes crashing to


---------49:12----------
the ground when you're not busy


---------49:14----------
um well um


---------49:17----------
or is that the kitchen scenario you


---------49:19----------
described


---------49:21----------
no that's not the kitchen scenario um


---------49:25----------
let's see um


---------49:28----------
what kind of stuff are you looking for


---------49:31----------
like behavior


---------49:32----------
are you like so when you're not busy


---------49:34----------
what happens so you're saying that you


---------49:36----------
use busy as a coping mechanism


---------49:38----------
maybe it sounds like he uses gaming as a


---------49:40----------
coping mechanism


---------49:42----------
yeah i'm not busy i'm like sad


---------49:46----------
um what are you sad about


---------49:50----------
everything that i haven't uh processed


---------49:53----------
emotionally


---------49:54----------
um so like relationships with my family


---------49:58----------
um i think


---------50:01----------
i like judge myself a lot for uh i think


---------50:04----------
we all do


---------50:04----------
but um let's see


---------50:08----------
um i judge myself for not like mediating


---------50:12----------
those relationships better


---------50:14----------
with your family yeah okay


---------50:17----------
yeah um


---------50:20----------
yeah do you have thoughts about evan


---------50:23----------
when you're standing still


---------50:26----------
and you also this is interesting um


---------50:31----------
i feel like evan is like really in my


---------50:34----------
corner


---------50:35----------
on life right now and understands like


---------50:38----------
he listens to me


---------50:39----------
a lot he's a very good listener um


---------50:42----------
and i don't always feel like members of


---------50:44----------
my family are able


---------50:45----------
to uh listen to me in that way so


---------50:49----------
um yeah i think


---------50:53----------
evan's like the best cheerleader i have


---------50:54----------
in my life um


---------50:57----------
sounds like he supports you very well


---------50:59----------
yeah i'm very lucky


---------51:00----------
um yeah so uh in a selfish way most of


---------51:05----------
the time i'm not thinking about evan


---------51:06----------
um but when i do i know i


---------51:10----------
like catastrophize things so


---------51:13----------
like evan is like quick to anger


---------51:16----------
about i guess normally like little


---------51:19----------
things like


---------51:20----------
um it was like heating up water on the


---------51:23----------
stove the other day he's like i just


---------51:25----------
hate the sound the stove makes


---------51:27----------
like just like kind of crackles i was


---------51:29----------
like oh


---------51:30----------
well like i can stop it and he's like no


---------51:32----------
don't do that and i just like stop it


---------51:33----------
thinking like i'll solve this problem


---------51:35----------
by like eliminating the fact that this


---------51:38----------
the stove is even crackling and then


---------51:40----------
he's like why did you do that like it


---------51:42----------
gets angry


---------51:43----------
um and then in those moments when i shut


---------51:46----------
down


---------51:46----------
i like begin to think like that's when


---------51:49----------
like the negative thoughts about our


---------51:50----------
relationship


---------51:51----------
come to boyle i guess come to surface


---------51:54----------
is like um


---------51:58----------
i think the easy things for me to think


---------52:00----------
are like


---------52:02----------
he's failing to see the way i see the


---------52:04----------
world he's not asking questions about


---------52:06----------
the way i see the world


---------52:08----------
um and like


---------52:12----------
uh yeah and then i lose the fact


---------52:16----------
that he is the biggest


---------52:20----------
advocate of me and my success in my life


---------52:22----------
and i think


---------52:23----------
the stove boiling is a big


---------52:27----------
metaphor for the destruction of our


---------52:29----------
relationship


---------52:31----------
how what's the metaphor like


---------52:34----------
that him like this just demonstrates his


---------52:38----------
inability to see the world i see the way


---------52:40----------
i see the world


---------52:42----------
ah so this goes back to the


---------52:43----------
compatibility in living different lives


---------52:46----------
yeah i think so um and like


---------52:49----------
i know saying that now this isn't true


---------52:52----------
but in the moment


---------52:53----------
it feels like so


---------52:56----------
intense and so founded in truth


---------53:02----------
okay


---------53:08----------
i'm gonna think for just a second okay


---------53:11----------
okay


---------53:11----------
so let me ask you a question um alexa


---------53:15----------
when you were growing up did you find


---------53:19----------
that


---------53:20----------
when you felt bad


---------53:23----------
that you could change something about


---------53:25----------
your behavior that would make people


---------53:27----------
less angry with you


---------53:31----------
um i think i was a mediator in our


---------53:33----------
family um


---------53:34----------
i had two older sisters my parents had a


---------53:38----------
very very turbulent marriage if you


---------53:40----------
would even call it that


---------53:42----------
uh until they got divorced when i was in


---------53:44----------
uh high school


---------53:46----------
um so i always


---------53:49----------
like yeah so you always what


---------53:52----------
uh i always felt some responsibility to


---------53:54----------
like peace keep the household


---------53:56----------
like getting in between altercations i


---------53:58----------
wasn't involved in


---------54:00----------
or like i just


---------54:03----------
like wanted my family to be happy and


---------54:05----------
didn't understand why they couldn't be


---------54:08----------
okay and when when evan is like just


---------54:12----------
you know hanging around and he says the


---------54:14----------
sound of the water boiling is so


---------54:15----------
annoying


---------54:16----------
do you know what your first feeling in


---------54:19----------
response to that is


---------54:21----------
uh like fear that um


---------54:25----------
my actions are gonna make us have a bad


---------54:28----------
day


---------54:30----------
like my actions of like


---------54:33----------
choosing to boil water which like as i


---------54:36----------
say it i know is ridiculous


---------54:38----------
sure but yeah if i'm being honest that


---------54:41----------
would be it


---------54:47----------
do you ever get the feeling that he has


---------54:49----------
one foot out the door


---------54:51----------
no okay like


---------54:54----------
yeah uh he didn't have to move with me


---------54:57----------
uh and that's why i feel some guilt


---------54:58----------
like he absolutely did not have like i


---------55:00----------
was even like contemplating


---------55:02----------
uh beginning my grad program here if uh


---------55:04----------
evan wasn't up to the move


---------55:06----------
but yeah he sacrificed a lot to be with


---------55:08----------
me okay


---------55:18----------
so he sacrifices a lot to be with you


---------55:22----------
yeah what do you think he gives up


---------55:25----------
um living close to his friends


---------55:29----------
um


---------55:33----------
uh like time like


---------55:36----------
he definitely could gain more if i


---------55:38----------
wasn't around


---------55:39----------
um how much does he gain


---------55:44----------
uh i think it depends um like for a


---------55:46----------
while he had like


---------55:48----------
a break in work and he was like i think


---------55:51----------
he was playing


---------55:52----------
i don't even know what he was playing


---------55:53----------
but something a lot of hours a day


---------55:56----------
um and like how many hours per week


---------56:02----------
i'm not really like keeping a time


---------56:05----------
on it maybe like a part time


---------56:08----------
i don't know maybe like we've been


---------56:10----------
moving i don't know


---------56:13----------
so like when he games i think it's


---------56:15----------
probably like a part-time job


---------56:19----------
okay so


---------56:22----------
i i'm a little bit so i'm just trying to


---------56:24----------
get a sense of like what his day looks


---------56:26----------
like


---------56:27----------
so okay yeah i can tell you what his day


---------56:29----------
looks like so


---------56:31----------
he would like wake up make breakfast and


---------56:34----------
then


---------56:35----------
we would like go for a walk together or


---------56:37----------
he would like


---------56:39----------
and then we'd come home and there'd be


---------56:40----------
some down time and he would game


---------56:42----------
and then i would try to find something


---------56:44----------
to fill the rest of my day


---------56:46----------
like i'd go to the gym or like walk my


---------56:48----------
dog again


---------56:50----------
or like yeah um


---------56:55----------
and so so i am are we talking like


---------56:58----------
five hours a day on average more or less


---------57:02----------
probably less than that okay yeah


---------57:07----------
um feels like more to me because i mean


---------57:10----------
what i'm hearing is like


---------57:11----------
you do something in the morning and then


---------57:13----------
you find something to fill the rest of


---------57:15----------
your day


---------57:16----------
which then sort of implies to me that


---------57:18----------
he's gaming for the rest of the day


---------57:21----------
i don't know that that's a fair


---------57:23----------
assumption like we always eat dinner


---------57:24----------
together


---------57:25----------
okay um and evan like it's a very good


---------57:28----------
cook


---------57:29----------
i'm very spoiled uh so he makes dinner


---------57:32----------
for sure


---------57:33----------
yeah uh well he's really into like uh


---------57:36----------
like korean street cooking now


---------57:40----------
so i'm eating all of these yeah i mean


---------57:43----------
yeah he has like bought tools off amazon


---------57:45----------
and stuff now


---------57:46----------
so now i know it's like official uh


---------57:49----------
yeah okay very spoiled yeah he makes


---------57:52----------
yeah


---------57:53----------
uh so i eat some like very impressive


---------57:56----------
dish for dinner


---------57:57----------
and then we'll like spend the rest of


---------57:59----------
the evening like watching netflix


---------58:01----------
together or like going for another walk


---------58:02----------
or something


---------58:03----------
okay and then he used to he's like


---------58:06----------
trying to regulate his sleep schedule


---------58:07----------
right now


---------58:08----------
um but like after i like to go to bed


---------58:11----------
really early


---------58:13----------
um but he would like often stay up


---------58:15----------
really late


---------58:16----------
and play games and


---------58:19----------
i think that bothered him that we lit


---------58:22----------
had such different like


---------58:23----------
schedules but now seems to bother you


---------58:28----------
what does that bother you ah


---------58:31----------
um like yes and no um so i used to work


---------58:37----------
morning shifts that would start at six


---------58:39----------
a.m so i would like


---------58:40----------
be up by five and like sometimes he


---------58:43----------
would still be up and he would like make


---------58:44----------
me breakfast


---------58:45----------
so that was pretty dope um


---------58:48----------
but i mean like when he sleep


---------58:52----------
if he would sleep in the middle of the


---------58:52----------
day it would be uh


---------58:55----------
sometimes difficult like sometimes i


---------58:57----------
would find myself saying like


---------58:59----------
um like why can't you be awake when the


---------59:02----------
rest of the world is


---------59:04----------
um and that's just a difference i think


---------59:08----------
i fundamentally can't understand


---------59:10----------
um okay because i don't like to function


---------59:14----------
at night i don't know


---------59:15----------
yeah so alexa you know i'm just going to


---------59:17----------
point something out so like it seems


---------59:19----------
strange to me that you're saying he


---------59:20----------
plays and maybe this is just


---------59:22----------
i just want to clarify but like i'm


---------59:24----------
envisioning


---------59:25----------
you know if you go to bed maybe around


---------59:28----------
10 and you wake up at five


---------59:31----------
and he's still awake at five like that's


---------59:33----------
seven hours right there


---------59:37----------
right yeah yeah i suppose you're right


---------59:39----------
and i think some days


---------59:41----------
uh that is true and i think it's hard


---------59:44----------
for me


---------59:44----------
to pin down these hours uh because it


---------59:48----------
like sometimes he'll really be into a


---------59:49----------
game and be playing a lot with his


---------59:50----------
friends and like


---------59:52----------
sometimes he won't like we've been


---------59:53----------
moving so there's been no time to play


---------59:55----------
video games


---------59:56----------
for the past like couple weeks or a


---------59:59----------
month probably


---------60:00----------
yeah what i'm hearing from you is that


---------60:02----------
you don't think his gaming is really a


---------60:03----------
problem


---------60:06----------
um i think that's accurate and i also


---------60:09----------
would probably


---------60:09----------
preface that with like i know his mom


---------60:13----------
has made such a big deal about his


---------60:15----------
gaming in his life but like i don't want


---------60:16----------
to be his mother


---------60:18----------
um and it's not my job to tell an adult


---------60:20----------
how they should spend their time


---------60:22----------
so do you think he should be spending


---------60:24----------
his time differently


---------60:26----------
it's one thing to not tell him but do


---------60:27----------
you think he should be spending his time


---------60:28----------
differently


---------60:29----------
i think he utilizes his time in the best


---------60:32----------
way he thinks he can and if he can't


---------60:34----------
he'll ask me for help


---------60:35----------
and yes like hey babe can you wake me up


---------60:38----------
when you get up in the morning and i'm


---------60:39----------
like happy to step in and help then


---------60:42----------
okay so i ask you the question do you


---------60:44----------
think


---------60:45----------
that there's a problem and you said i


---------60:47----------
think he


---------60:48----------
thinks that there isn't a problem and


---------60:50----------
when he thinks there's a problem he asks


---------60:51----------
for my help


---------60:53----------
oh man normally i can pull off these


---------60:55----------
tactics dr k


---------60:57----------
right so what do you think um


---------61:01----------
i think perhaps he would be happier if


---------61:03----------
he had a more


---------61:05----------
balanced life where he could enjoy


---------61:08----------
playing video games in a smaller amount


---------61:10----------
of time every day


---------61:11----------
and not feel as guilty about it so i'm


---------61:14----------
i'm detecting you've said this a couple


---------61:16----------
of times


---------61:16----------
so you're picking up that he feels


---------61:18----------
guilty for the amount that he gains


---------61:22----------
yes


---------61:26----------
now see that's interesting because that


---------61:28----------
puts you in a weird situation


---------61:30----------
uh yeah it's definitely difficult to


---------61:33----------
navigate


---------61:34----------
but i think i will like i think i'm more


---------61:36----------
readily able to navigate this space


---------61:38----------
because of like my uh role in my family


---------61:42----------
model


---------61:43----------
growing up yep so which is conflict


---------61:46----------
avoidance


---------61:48----------
mediation right so here's here's what i


---------61:50----------
think is tricky about your situation


---------61:51----------
alexa


---------61:52----------
on the one hand so it sounds like you


---------61:55----------
understand him pretty well


---------61:56----------
you care about him and you support him


---------61:59----------
and so it's i'm hearing from you


---------62:02----------
basically because you're not saying


---------62:05----------
you're stepping around this but i i


---------62:08----------
suspect that you think that


---------62:10----------
his gaming is negatively impacting him


---------62:12----------
in some way


---------62:13----------
and even if we take that off the table


---------62:16----------
at least we can acknowledge that he


---------62:18----------
sometimes thinks that


---------62:20----------
now that puts you in a weird situation


---------62:22----------
because if you want to support


---------62:23----------
him and his goals and help him feel less


---------62:26----------
guilty


---------62:27----------
then you're kind of stuck because if you


---------62:29----------
start pushing him in that direction then


---------62:30----------
you become his mom


---------62:33----------
yeah yeah so that's my job to parent an


---------62:36----------
adult yeah


---------62:37----------
yeah so that sounds tricky because even


---------62:38----------
if you want to help him it maybe turns


---------62:40----------
into


---------62:41----------
looking like his mom very very quickly


---------62:43----------
so i'm not quite sure what you would do


---------62:45----------
in that situation like i don't know how


---------62:46----------
to navigate that right


---------62:49----------
um yeah that's correct


---------62:52----------
i think probably if i was more


---------62:54----------
straightforward uh


---------62:55----------
we probably would be having a different


---------62:58----------
conversation today


---------63:00----------
um so here's the other thing


---------63:03----------
uh alexa that i'm just gonna toss out


---------63:05----------
there i don't know if this is


---------63:06----------
legit or not but i've gotten the sense


---------63:09----------
that


---------63:09----------
you speak very very protectively and


---------63:12----------
positively of him


---------63:15----------
and and so that's cool like i think


---------63:17----------
everything you say is genuine


---------63:19----------
and at the same time sometimes when


---------63:22----------
people do that


---------63:23----------
it's like they're almost compensating


---------63:25----------
for something else that they're not


---------63:26----------
saying


---------63:28----------
right so like like do you feel like


---------63:30----------
there are things


---------63:31----------
ways that you feel about him that maybe


---------63:33----------
because we're on the internet


---------63:36----------
you don't feel comfortable sharing which


---------63:39----------
is


---------63:39----------
totally legit it's just like you know


---------63:41----------
here's the picture that i'm getting


---------63:43----------
right he's


---------63:44----------
he's a guy who has moved across whatever


---------63:47----------
for you


---------63:48----------
um you know cooks you korean street food


---------63:50----------
is thoughtful and caring


---------63:53----------
and sounds like in some ways the perfect


---------63:55----------
boyfriend sometimes he plays a little


---------63:56----------
bit too much sometimes you show up at


---------63:58----------
home


---------63:59----------
and you're kind of like twiddling your


---------64:00----------
thumbs for a little bit and he's like


---------64:01----------
kind of not responsive and you recognize


---------64:03----------
that


---------64:04----------
you know he can't pause the game to come


---------64:07----------
and say hi to you


---------64:09----------
or you know he can't stop playing and


---------64:12----------
then you kind of like you're kind of


---------64:13----------
living your life and he's sort of living


---------64:15----------
his life


---------64:16----------
and it sounds like every now and then


---------64:18----------
you guys like meet at a train station


---------64:19----------
and hang out for a little bit and then


---------64:21----------
you guys board your separate trains and


---------64:22----------
then you


---------64:23----------
you know and that's the picture that


---------64:25----------
you're painting to me


---------64:27----------
which seems very positive but i'm i'm


---------64:30----------
getting like there's like something


---------64:32----------
underneath the surface here that you


---------64:33----------
guys aren't able to talk about


---------64:35----------
and i'm not even sure if you're really i


---------64:37----------
can't tell if you're not aware


---------64:39----------
or if i'm reading too much into it or


---------64:42----------
you're not saying something does that


---------64:44----------
make sense because like so far it sounds


---------64:45----------
like an


---------64:46----------
awesome relationship which in a lot of


---------64:47----------
ways it clearly is


---------64:49----------
yeah i think um maybe the thing you're


---------64:53----------
missing


---------64:54----------
is um


---------64:57----------
yeah most of the time we function well


---------65:00----------
together


---------65:01----------
and we live and inhabit our space as


---------65:03----------
well um


---------65:05----------
but when we clash it's like


---------65:08----------
a huge problem and um


---------65:15----------
like we probably


---------65:19----------
uh avoid talking about


---------65:22----------
um long-term compatibility because we're


---------65:26----------
scared of the idea that like we could


---------65:28----------
not


---------65:28----------
like it's possible we're not compatible


---------65:33----------
in the long term and then when these


---------65:35----------
clashes happen


---------65:37----------
there's like fallout for days and


---------65:40----------
what is fun look like uh like not


---------65:43----------
sleeping in the same bed


---------65:45----------
um sometimes i'll like go to my mom's


---------65:49----------
house


---------65:50----------
um what are the conversations


---------65:54----------
sorry go ahead no yeah what's the


---------65:57----------
conversation


---------65:58----------
what are the conversations about not


---------66:00----------
being compatible look like


---------66:03----------
um well like the most recent thing i


---------66:06----------
recollect is um


---------66:10----------
i don't even know how we


---------66:14----------
i said something like


---------66:18----------
my memory is hazy so i'll do my best to


---------66:20----------
recreate this but i said something like


---------66:23----------
um i don't know it just annoys me when


---------66:25----------
you treat me like that


---------66:26----------
and then whatever and then he's like


---------66:28----------
well do you really want me to come up


---------66:29----------
with something about why i think i do


---------66:31----------
that and i'm like yeah i do


---------66:32----------
and he said well i just think you're an


---------66:33----------
annoying person


---------66:35----------
uh and like for someone who tries so


---------66:38----------
hard to foster their


---------66:40----------
image to the world i think i try much


---------66:42----------
harder than evan probably does


---------66:44----------
like was like


---------66:47----------
uh wrecked my


---------66:51----------
presumptions about our relationship um


---------66:55----------
and it's like really that shouldn't


---------66:58----------
matter i think like that comment


---------67:01----------
what shouldn't matter that he thinks i'm


---------67:04----------
annoying


---------67:05----------
why isn't that i'm confused like


---------67:08----------
i think i would try to justify and say


---------67:09----------
like if anybody else said this i


---------67:11----------
wouldn't care


---------67:12----------
but uh yeah it matters


---------67:15----------
because um yeah evan's kind of my person


---------67:21----------
alex i get the sense that you


---------67:24----------
yeah you're very protective pam


---------67:27----------
it's strange i think sometimes you place


---------67:29----------
his opinion above your own


---------67:32----------
but that does sound incredibly hurtful


---------67:34----------
because it sounds like he's making a


---------67:35----------
judgment about you as a person


---------67:38----------
yeah i've heard that feedback um from


---------67:40----------
some friends as well


---------67:42----------
what feedback um that they think


---------67:45----------
uh i like lower my


---------67:48----------
view on the totem pole in our


---------67:50----------
relationship


---------67:53----------
yeah yeah um


---------68:00----------
now help me understand how we get to the


---------68:03----------
him saying


---------68:04----------
you're an annoying person


---------68:08----------
um


---------68:11----------
okay i actually have no idea what


---------68:12----------
actually happened before that yeah


---------68:15----------
um if i can feel like a general gist of


---------68:17----------
like something that would happen


---------68:19----------
um would be like uh


---------68:23----------
so like something happens evan is like


---------68:26----------
quick to anger


---------68:27----------
and kind of like snaps um


---------68:31----------
and then i either like shut down or


---------68:34----------
i'm like let's let's brawl bro like


---------68:37----------
let's do this


---------68:38----------
um and


---------68:42----------
so yeah then i probably was like well


---------68:44----------
why are you even treating me like this


---------68:45----------
like


---------68:46----------
you're treating me like trash like this


---------68:48----------
is not nice i don't like being treated


---------68:49----------
like that


---------68:50----------
and then like you know


---------68:54----------
then it all comes tumbling out and then


---------68:56----------
he probably legitimate i don't know if


---------68:57----------
he knows their nose


---------68:59----------
i know it's something he works on that


---------69:02----------
is


---------69:03----------
like quickness to anger um but


---------69:08----------
um yeah and then


---------69:12----------
he'll like produce something in response


---------69:16----------
that he probably really thinks and i'm


---------69:18----------
not ready to hear it


---------69:20----------
okay um i just want to point out so like


---------69:23----------
you know you did


---------69:24----------
you do this thing where you'll point out


---------69:25----------
a flaw he has


---------69:27----------
like he's quick to anger and then you


---------69:29----------
follow it up with i know it's something


---------69:30----------
he's working on


---------69:32----------
so i think that's what what people are


---------69:33----------
protected presenting is like


---------69:35----------
or detecting like that's what i detect


---------69:37----------
is like a sense of protection


---------69:39----------
because whenever you kind of point out


---------69:40----------
you also it's like you're it's


---------69:43----------
you kind of mentioned that you're


---------69:44----------
concerned about image and i wonder if


---------69:46----------
you're protecting his image too


---------69:48----------
by sort of pointing out you know it's


---------69:51----------
weird like i just i think it's reflexive


---------69:53----------
in your mind that anytime you kind of


---------69:54----------
have a negative like you have to balance


---------69:56----------
it with a positive


---------69:58----------
yeah uh yeah called out um and


---------70:02----------
i appreciate you telling me this um


---------70:06----------
yeah i think i do this


---------70:10----------
obviously it's a coping mechanism sure


---------70:13----------
um


---------70:14----------
and i think in the home i grew up in


---------70:17----------
yeah that was like the only thing i


---------70:19----------
could do to like


---------70:21----------
convince myself i was okay yeah


---------70:24----------
so she's like yeah here's the concern


---------70:26----------
that i have around that


---------70:28----------
so i think that you guys have a lot of


---------70:30----------
stuff under the surface


---------70:32----------
and as long as your mind


---------70:37----------
when your mind sees a negative and it


---------70:39----------
puts up a positive


---------70:41----------
it removes the need to actually have any


---------70:43----------
discussion because on balance


---------70:45----------
everything's okay


---------70:47----------
and then things kind of get propagated


---------70:48----------
and then i think you wind up kind of


---------70:50----------
where you are and i'm not saying that


---------70:51----------
you guys are in the situation because of


---------70:52----------
you alone


---------70:53----------
it's a group you know you guys are at


---------70:55----------
this team game


---------70:56----------
and and and so i'm just i'm noticing


---------70:59----------
that there's like a certain amount of


---------71:00----------
maybe this is what your friends sort of


---------71:01----------
say about putting yourself lower on the


---------71:03----------
totem pole


---------71:04----------
i don't know if it's like sure you can


---------71:06----------
call it a self-esteem thing but i think


---------71:08----------
just it


---------71:08----------
in a way you've learned how to see pause


---------71:12----------
like to see the silver lining of a cloud


---------71:15----------
because otherwise life would be bleak


---------71:19----------
yeah damn that hits home yeah


---------71:22----------
and and i think the challenge here is


---------71:24----------
that like sometimes life


---------71:26----------
is weak right


---------71:29----------
and and we have to acknowledge or it's


---------71:32----------
it's my


---------71:33----------
it's my experience that really the way


---------71:35----------
that we fix


---------71:36----------
problems is like you know if my sink


---------71:38----------
pipe is busted


---------71:40----------
and there's water going everywhere and


---------71:42----------
i'm sitting there and i'm like well at


---------71:43----------
least i don't have to mop


---------71:45----------
because like the water's cleaning the


---------71:46----------
floor you know like that's


---------71:48----------
it's adaptive absolutely i don't blame


---------71:50----------
you for doing it because i think it's


---------71:51----------
it's like really a survival mechanism


---------71:53----------
and at the same time sometimes it can


---------71:55----------
allow


---------71:56----------
problems to propagate


---------72:00----------
and what i'm hearing from you is that


---------72:02----------
problems have propagated i still don't


---------72:03----------
know what


---------72:05----------
but it seems like you guys are kind of


---------72:06----------
getting to this place where you're


---------72:08----------
thinking about


---------72:08----------
long-term compatibility which i don't


---------72:10----------
even know what that means


---------72:12----------
like what does that mean like why would


---------72:13----------
you guys not be long-term compatible


---------72:16----------
what what are the ways in which you guys


---------72:18----------
are different


---------72:20----------
that means that you guys may not be


---------72:21----------
together


---------72:25----------
um how are you feeling by the way am i


---------72:29----------
being rough on you


---------72:30----------
yeah i'm not feeling good but that's


---------72:32----------
okay so let's think about that


---------72:34----------
hold on in what ways are you not because


---------72:36----------
i'm sorry to make you feel that way but


---------72:39----------
let's explore that are you okay with


---------72:41----------
that or you want to


---------72:43----------
what are you feeling


---------72:48----------
okay um


---------72:52----------
i'm feeling like bad about the problems


---------72:56----------
i've created


---------72:57----------
okay um


---------73:02----------
and like


---------73:06----------
um unable to do anything about them


---------73:10----------
okay okay


---------73:16----------
alexa can you listen to me yeah are you


---------73:19----------
able to


---------73:20----------
yeah so i want to point out something


---------73:21----------
that you said earlier okay i i don't


---------73:23----------
think things are as bad as you think


---------73:25----------
they are


---------73:26----------
and i'd like to help you try to


---------73:27----------
understand how


---------73:30----------
can you run with me for a little bit


---------73:32----------
okay yeah


---------73:33----------
you said earlier that when he asks you


---------73:37----------
he when he mentions to you that the


---------73:40----------
kettle


---------73:42----------
makes him he doesn't like the sound of


---------73:44----------
the kettle


---------73:46----------
do you remember what you said to me


---------73:48----------
about how that makes you feel


---------73:51----------
uh yeah of about what


---------73:55----------
uh that i'm gonna ruin the day is that


---------73:58----------
how you're feeling right now


---------74:00----------
yeah same thing right so here's the


---------74:03----------
thing


---------74:03----------
it it's like it's like a mode that's


---------74:06----------
activated


---------74:07----------
this is the it's [ __ ] alex's fault


---------74:12----------
right it's the same thing and the thing


---------74:14----------
is


---------74:15----------
it just as it's illogical then it's com


---------74:18----------
it's it doesn't mean it's false


---------74:19----------
but that feeling arises it's the same


---------74:21----------
thing you're like oh now i see how much


---------74:23----------
i've messed up our relationship


---------74:25----------
dude you haven't messed up your


---------74:26----------
relationship really like i honestly


---------74:28----------
believe that


---------74:30----------
i think that something somewhere along


---------74:32----------
the way you've got some kind of


---------74:33----------
programming


---------74:35----------
that when someone expresses


---------74:38----------
anything vaguely like a criticism


---------74:40----------
because i think this is the other weird


---------74:41----------
thing


---------74:42----------
now i got to be careful about this


---------74:43----------
because i don't think this is your fault


---------74:44----------
but i think it's something you can


---------74:45----------
change


---------74:46----------
i think sometimes evan is actually


---------74:49----------
looking for validation from you


---------74:52----------
and what you try to do is make his life


---------74:54----------
better


---------74:55----------
when really all he wants you to do is


---------74:56----------
sit and listen


---------74:59----------
right so he doesn't actually want you to


---------75:00----------
change like he doesn't want you to


---------75:02----------
change because he recognizes that it's


---------75:04----------
absurd


---------75:05----------
that you should turn off the kettle


---------75:06----------
because he finds it annoying


---------75:08----------
yeah what he actually wants from you is


---------75:10----------
not for you to fix his problems but a


---------75:12----------
shoulder to cry on


---------75:13----------
kind of but something is happening where


---------75:16----------
like when i point out


---------75:18----------
you know when i start to criticize the


---------75:20----------
nature of your relationship which is i


---------75:22----------
think what we're here for


---------75:24----------
yeah right and then this thing arises


---------75:27----------
and then like kind of takes over and


---------75:29----------
then you're like oh [ __ ] i [ __ ] it up


---------75:31----------
it's all my fault and there's nothing i


---------75:33----------
can do to fix it


---------75:35----------
which is whereas honestly i believe the


---------75:37----------
exact opposite


---------75:41----------
what do you think about that yeah um


---------75:46----------
yeah i think you're right and i think


---------75:48----------
like this response isn't helping me as a


---------75:51----------
person get what i want


---------75:52----------
in my life uh what i like deserve


---------75:57----------
and i'd like to not do that okay


---------75:59----------
especially in my


---------76:00----------
relationship with evan okay do you blame


---------76:04----------
yourself for having this response


---------76:09----------
i sound gnarly no this will just sound


---------76:12----------
gnarly but i blame my family


---------76:14----------
good that's the right people to blame


---------76:18----------
because here's here's the concern that i


---------76:20----------
had because remember your response is to


---------76:22----------
blame yourself right


---------76:24----------
yes that's the response my actions are


---------76:26----------
going to make us have a bad day


---------76:28----------
and so then when i ask you so here's the


---------76:30----------
tricky thing right like as i point out


---------76:31----------
this response to you


---------76:33----------
that same complex could arise again and


---------76:35----------
say oh it's my fault


---------76:37----------
for having this complex in the first


---------76:38----------
place


---------76:40----------
which would just be the complex i don't


---------76:41----------
know if that makes sense yeah no it does


---------76:44----------
i yeah it's alexa's fault complex it's


---------76:48----------
like


---------76:48----------
it's alex's fault.exe let's open up that


---------76:51----------
program


---------76:51----------
and so then when i ask you is it alexa's


---------76:53----------
fault that you keep on opening up this


---------76:55----------
exe this [ __ ] malware


---------76:57----------
and you're like actually it's my parents


---------76:59----------
fault which means that that's not the


---------77:00----------
programmer


---------77:02----------
which i i agree right so i think that


---------77:04----------
this is something that you learn to do


---------77:06----------
as an adaptation


---------77:08----------
that by taking all the blame onto


---------77:10----------
yourself


---------77:13----------
you absolve other people of blame and if


---------77:16----------
you absolve other people of blame


---------77:17----------
then that allows you to stay in some


---------77:20----------
kinds of relationships


---------77:22----------
yeah or at least like uphold a world


---------77:23----------
view that i think is important


---------77:26----------
yeah beautifully said right


---------77:30----------
yeah um


---------77:34----------
okay how are you feeling now


---------77:38----------
feeling good yeah weird huh yeah no i


---------77:41----------
feel a lot better thank you


---------77:43----------
yeah so what happened there let's try to


---------77:45----------
understand that for a second


---------77:47----------
um it came up


---------77:50----------
yeah and yeah how did we make it


---------77:55----------
probably some fairy dust i don't know


---------77:59----------
um i like stopped taking


---------78:03----------
responsibility for other people's


---------78:05----------
actions but how did you do that just now


---------78:08----------
because i made you feel like [ __ ] there


---------78:09----------
for a second


---------78:12----------
oh how did i do that


---------78:15----------
okay because that's an important skill


---------78:18----------
yo


---------78:19----------
yeah that is that that's one i should


---------78:21----------
retain um


---------78:22----------
yeah um what did i do um


---------78:26----------
[Music]


---------78:28----------
well i i realized like everything shitty


---------78:31----------
in my life


---------78:32----------
isn't always my fault but that's what


---------78:35----------
you were thinking right


---------78:36----------
how did you realize that


---------78:39----------
how did i realize that because you think


---------78:42----------
it's your fault


---------78:44----------
and then somehow today just now you were


---------78:46----------
able to realize it


---------78:48----------
and i i think basically the main thing


---------78:50----------
is pointing it out to you


---------78:52----------
so if you see that there's like malware


---------78:55----------
on your computer and you like


---------78:56----------
you know open up your processes and you


---------78:58----------
see it's there then you can like end


---------79:00----------
task that [ __ ]


---------79:03----------
so like just try to catch this and


---------79:04----------
recognize


---------79:06----------
alexa that at some points you got you're


---------79:09----------
going to be interacting


---------79:10----------
and then it's alexa's [ __ ] fault


---------79:13----------
gets called up yeah and then then what's


---------79:16----------
going to happen is


---------79:17----------
that controls you and when that controls


---------79:19----------
you you turn off the stove


---------79:23----------
right yeah because that's what it's


---------79:26----------
alexa's


---------79:26----------
forget that i want to make tea how dare


---------79:29----------
i inconvenience him with sound and then


---------79:31----------
he gets infuriated because he's like


---------79:33----------
that's [ __ ] insane like your t is


---------79:36----------
more important than my


---------79:37----------
inconvenience yeah


---------79:40----------
and and i i mean i don't think anyone


---------79:42----------
here is an [ __ ] it's it's just like


---------79:44----------
genuinely like this is what happens when


---------79:46----------
patterns


---------79:46----------
in our mind are operating without our


---------79:49----------
knowledge


---------79:50----------
yeah so just try to catch it and notice


---------79:52----------
it that sometimes if people say things


---------79:54----------
to you that may seem critical


---------79:56----------
it can pop up yeah i think


---------79:59----------
perhaps why i do this so much also is


---------80:01----------
like i get a lot of validation from


---------80:02----------
doing it uh like in


---------80:04----------
mexico academics um


---------80:07----------
especially in academics when you say


---------80:09----------
like i take full responsibility for


---------80:12----------
answering this


---------80:13----------
really like shitty twist


---------80:17----------
like test question wrong and i'm gonna


---------80:19----------
be the one student who realizes like i


---------80:21----------
should have studied more


---------80:23----------
people like you yeah that's that's five


---------80:25----------
head level [ __ ] so here's the other


---------80:27----------
thing right so like


---------80:28----------
you're not broken like this is adaptive


---------80:31----------
especially in academia beating yourself


---------80:33----------
up is how you it sounds like you're


---------80:35----------
starting a graduate program


---------80:36----------
it's the reason that you're starting


---------80:38----------
your graduate program if you didn't beat


---------80:39----------
yourself up in undergrad you never would


---------80:41----------
have gotten into grad school


---------80:44----------
yeah so that's a very very insightful


---------80:46----------
connection there


---------80:47----------
alexa okay so let me just ask you one


---------80:50----------
last question and let's get


---------80:51----------
i i imagine evan is getting nervous and


---------80:53----------
hopefully he's not watching


---------80:55----------
no i don't think he will be um nervous


---------80:58----------
or watching


---------80:59----------
oh i'm sure he's not watching okay


---------81:03----------
so in what ways are you guys not


---------81:04----------
compatible why are you concerned about


---------81:06----------
your future


---------81:08----------
um okay i'm gonna come up with some good


---------81:12----------
[ __ ] here


---------81:13----------
okay um


---------81:17----------
i worry that um


---------81:21----------
like my main concern would be like if we


---------81:23----------
ever have children i worry


---------81:25----------
that we're not gonna have a way to solve


---------81:27----------
our problems


---------81:29----------
and that our like children will be


---------81:31----------
subjected to a turbulent home life


---------81:34----------
okay so you're concerned about your your


---------81:36----------
lack of conflict resolution


---------81:39----------
yes okay it's a good concern


---------81:42----------
i too am worried about your lack of


---------81:44----------
conflict resolution


---------81:48----------
good news is y'all are 22 and this is


---------81:49----------
when you guys learn this [ __ ]


---------81:51----------
people aren't good at conflict


---------81:52----------
resolution at the age of 22. i don't


---------81:54----------
know if you realize that or not


---------81:56----------
it's like but we could be you can start


---------81:58----------
the process


---------82:00----------
okay other concerns that you have


---------82:03----------
um


---------82:06----------
yeah i guess my main concern about how


---------82:09----------
differently the way


---------82:10----------
our lives look day to day


---------82:13----------
is that i want a partner to be


---------82:17----------
present with me like when i get home


---------82:21----------
and yeah okay


---------82:24----------
when i get home from school i don't want


---------82:26----------
to feel like a burden


---------82:28----------
for [ __ ] being home


---------82:31----------
okay and so then let me ask you


---------82:33----------
something do you feel like a


---------82:35----------
does does evan make you feel like a


---------82:38----------
burden or do you feel like a burden when


---------82:39----------
you come home


---------82:41----------
um sometimes i do because he's still


---------82:42----------
sleeping and then like


---------82:44----------
if i want to spend time with him i would


---------82:46----------
have to wake him up and he hates waking


---------82:48----------
up


---------82:49----------
okay yeah what about other times


---------82:52----------
what about when he's gaming and you come


---------82:54----------
home


---------82:55----------
um i would like we've talked a little


---------82:58----------
bit about this but i like to


---------82:59----------
i would like to know like a plan for


---------83:01----------
when he thinks he'll be done


---------83:03----------
so i don't sit around like a sad


---------83:05----------
housewife waiting for my


---------83:08----------
husband to get done with the work or


---------83:10----------
whatever


---------83:11----------
okay so you know what i didn't hear


---------83:14----------
there alexa how do you feel right now


---------83:17----------
muy bien okay really you feel okay yeah


---------83:20----------
yeah i feel fine because because i this


---------83:22----------
is the first time that i've heard you


---------83:24----------
kind of call him out and not protect him


---------83:27----------
yeah right so earlier


---------83:31----------
you were saying i recognize that i can't


---------83:34----------
always be the priority in his


---------83:36----------
in his life and that when i come home


---------83:38----------
finishing the game of league of legends


---------83:39----------
is more important than saying hello to


---------83:41----------
me and being warmly greeted


---------83:42----------
because he moved across country with me


---------83:45----------
to to pursue graduate school


---------83:46----------
that's what you said at the beginning


---------83:48----------
and now you're saying eh


---------83:51----------
actually yay we're going to torpedo your


---------83:54----------
relationship for the next 30 minutes


---------83:56----------
don't worry about it


---------83:57----------
but do you do do you see that difference


---------83:59----------
yeah


---------84:00----------
yeah no i do yes and i didn't know i was


---------84:03----------
doing it when i said


---------84:04----------
yeah so so but that's okay like it's


---------84:06----------
okay that you're doing it right because


---------84:08----------
it serves a purpose


---------84:09----------
it keeps your relationship harmonious


---------84:11----------
which i think has been very important


---------84:13----------
for both of you


---------84:14----------
yes doesn't fix it but keeps it


---------84:16----------
harmonious okay


---------84:18----------
um that makes sense to me


---------84:21----------
are you what do you think about like so


---------84:24----------
it sounds like you're


---------84:25----------
in grad school do you feel like you're


---------84:28----------
growing as a person


---------84:30----------
um i'll start in the fall i haven't


---------84:33----------
actually started yet


---------84:34----------
um am i growing as a person i think yes


---------84:38----------
because i'm going through a lot of hard


---------84:39----------
things


---------84:40----------
that like for the first time i'm having


---------84:42----------
to deal with as like an adult


---------84:44----------
and not like somebody living under my


---------84:48----------
uh family's domain cool


---------84:51----------
uh yeah do you feel like evan is growing


---------84:54----------
as a person


---------84:56----------
uh um


---------85:04----------
i think um


---------85:10----------
i would say not as much as he'd like to


---------85:13----------
but probably


---------85:14----------
i should say no right so so


---------85:17----------
even there in that construction you


---------85:20----------
feeling okay


---------85:21----------
yeah breathing you're being yeah you're


---------85:24----------
feeling i'm eight


---------85:25----------
yeah i'm anxious but that's okay okay


---------85:29----------
so so even then you did it again where


---------85:31----------
you kind of said


---------85:32----------
you started your answer with what you


---------85:35----------
said


---------85:36----------
something like he thinks not as much as


---------85:39----------
he wants to


---------85:40----------
and then you said like because you're


---------85:42----------
once again adopting his frame of mind


---------85:44----------
like i'm asking you what you think and


---------85:45----------
you said he's probably not


---------85:47----------
growing as much as he wants to


---------85:51----------
yeah what are you feeling now


---------85:52----------
something's happening alexa what's


---------85:54----------
happening


---------85:55----------
well it's just like a really messed up


---------85:56----------
way to think that's not gonna help me


---------85:59----------
and i feel like bummed that i'm a


---------86:03----------
person who is like trying so much


---------86:06----------
to appease their partner's frame of mind


---------86:09----------
even though


---------86:09----------
he's not even asking me to do that yep


---------86:12----------
and in fact when you do that


---------86:13----------
he actually gets frustrated yeah he gets


---------86:15----------
angry and like rightfully so it would be


---------86:17----------
really annoying


---------86:18----------
like yeah he's like yeah he like chose


---------86:21----------
me


---------86:22----------
because i can do my own thing okay so


---------86:25----------
now that i'm gonna any questions for me


---------86:30----------
no how you holding up we too harsh on


---------86:34----------
you


---------86:34----------
no it's okay this is good this is where


---------86:37----------
the growth happens


---------86:38----------
it's not fun is it


---------86:42----------
that's that's the real [ __ ]


---------86:45----------
i'll have a diet coke after this it'll


---------86:46----------
be fine good for you consider having a


---------86:48----------
regular one


---------86:50----------
yeah um okay so


---------86:54----------
you want to go ahead and grab evan yeah


---------86:56----------
okay i want you to just


---------86:58----------
take like i want you guys to just have


---------87:01----------
take like come back in like 60 to 90


---------87:03----------
seconds


---------87:04----------
okay just just recollect your thoughts


---------87:06----------
okay


---------87:07----------
okay all right we'll be back in 60 to 90


---------87:10----------
seconds


---------87:11----------
okay


---------87:14----------
[ __ ] i had something really important


---------87:18----------
i wanted to think about it but i just


---------87:20----------
lost it


---------87:29----------
oh yeah here's what it is


---------87:38----------
so she doesn't okay


---------87:58----------
okay


---------88:40----------
okay


---------89:08----------
hello


---------89:12----------
uh i don't know okay


---------89:29----------
all right so um


---------89:33----------
all right so first thank you guys so


---------89:35----------
much for coming on um


---------89:41----------
i'm gonna actually start by asking each


---------89:44----------
of you


---------89:45----------
to summarize what you unders


---------89:48----------
like what you took away from our


---------89:50----------
individual conversations


---------89:52----------
and share that with the other person


---------89:55----------
and like sort of what you feel is


---------89:57----------
important for them to know


---------89:59----------
okay so we're going to start with your


---------90:01----------
representations of our individual


---------90:02----------
conversation


---------90:05----------
the next thing that i'm going to ask so


---------90:07----------
if if you're


---------90:08----------
sharing if you're recapping the


---------90:10----------
conversation


---------90:11----------
what i want then the listener to do is


---------90:14----------
to repeat back what they heard


---------90:16----------
as opposed to respond so just make sure


---------90:19----------
that you guys are on the same page


---------90:21----------
okay so who wants to go first i'll go


---------90:24----------
first


---------90:25----------
okay um we talked about


---------90:28----------
how um the way in which i


---------90:33----------
blame myself is detrimental to us


---------90:35----------
communicating in our relationship


---------90:38----------
uh and doesn't really allow us to talk


---------90:42----------
about


---------90:43----------
all of our problems when i like


---------90:45----------
scapegoat myself


---------90:46----------
i think i use that as a way to like not


---------90:48----------
address our issues


---------90:50----------
because i'm like scared of actually


---------90:53----------
addressing them


---------90:56----------
yeah so what i heard is uh


---------90:59----------
in like those times when i'm


---------91:02----------
like from my perspective when i'm trying


---------91:04----------
to yeah start that conversation and


---------91:06----------
bring up that feeling


---------91:08----------
um you're like self-critical


---------91:12----------
like over overly harsh on yourself


---------91:16----------
part comes out and you start to think


---------91:19----------
only about like the things you


---------91:21----------
were doing wrong yeah i think like as a


---------91:23----------
way to like absolve you


---------91:25----------
because i think it's important in my


---------91:27----------
mind that i


---------91:28----------
always view you in some stagnant way


---------91:32----------
that like makes me feel comfortable


---------91:37----------
yeah that's really interesting yeah


---------91:42----------
okay


---------91:45----------
okay hold on so first of all


---------91:50----------
alexa we talked about more than you


---------91:54----------
blaming yourself which is the message


---------91:57----------
you're sending him


---------92:00----------
right yeah you summarize the


---------92:03----------
conversation is


---------92:05----------
i do something bad but we talked about


---------92:09----------
more than that


---------92:15----------
um are you with me or no


---------92:19----------
uh yeah


---------92:23----------
so i'm gonna ask evan evan repeat back


---------92:26----------
what you heard


---------92:28----------
and just listen to what he's saying yeah


---------92:30----------
i heard


---------92:31----------
uh that you


---------92:35----------
blaming yourself is the cause of our


---------92:38----------
breakdown in communication which in


---------92:41----------
another


---------92:41----------
itself is yeah you blaming yourself for


---------92:44----------
the breakdown of communication


---------92:46----------
so here we go [ __ ] my family


---------92:49----------
okay so so say more um


---------92:56----------
well i think i like learned these


---------92:58----------
adaptive uh


---------92:59----------
behaviors through like the role i played


---------93:02----------
as a mediator in my family


---------93:04----------
and those are not serving me well so i


---------93:06----------
would like to not do that


---------93:08----------
and to like i would like to think about


---------93:11----------
a better way


---------93:12----------
to think about myself in our


---------93:15----------
relationship


---------93:15----------
and i think it would be helpful if you


---------93:18----------
point it out and i'll do my best to not


---------93:20----------
scapegoat myself


---------93:21----------
okay great you want to repeat back


---------93:25----------
yeah that so you like at a certain at a


---------93:28----------
time in your life felt like you had to


---------93:30----------
be


---------93:30----------
that mature uh


---------93:33----------
like mediator of conversation and


---------93:38----------
that like you've it's easier for you to


---------93:41----------
blame yourself


---------93:42----------
than like engage with


---------93:46----------
our problems yeah okay so now comes


---------93:49----------
the next question which is


---------93:53----------
who is responsible for your situation


---------93:55----------
alexa


---------93:57----------
we both are and what is his fault


---------94:01----------
um oh um


---------94:08----------
it's hard isn't it yeah i don't know um


---------94:12----------
okay that's okay yeah that's okay


---------94:16----------
so i can also see you're starting to


---------94:18----------
feel anxious again


---------94:20----------
that's okay okay so we're gonna get to


---------94:23----------
that in a second


---------94:24----------
but i i want you evan to notice


---------94:28----------
that like i think you accept some


---------94:30----------
responsibility for your situation yes


---------94:33----------
yeah and you also see how she blames


---------94:36----------
herself for y'all's situation


---------94:39----------
yep and sometimes we talked about some


---------94:42----------
of the things that you do wrong


---------94:44----------
but even in this moment she's having


---------94:46----------
trouble


---------94:48----------
catching those because of the way that


---------94:49----------
she's been


---------94:51----------
the way she evolved in her family to be


---------94:54----------
like a mediator


---------94:55----------
and more mature and accept


---------94:56----------
responsibility she also mentioned that


---------94:58----------
it's like very helpful in academia for


---------95:00----------
her to do this thing


---------95:01----------
so it can be hard yeah right so in a


---------95:04----------
weird way


---------95:06----------
what you're gonna have to do is like


---------95:10----------
think like don't let her get away with


---------95:12----------
that [ __ ]


---------95:15----------
okay i like this right so like here's


---------95:17----------
the problem with a relationship


---------95:19----------
is if she blames herself like


---------95:22----------
both people have to have the same


---------95:24----------
strategy if i take all the


---------95:26----------
responsibility for all the problems in


---------95:27----------
my relationship


---------95:29----------
and my wife takes all the problems for


---------95:30----------
responsibility in our relationship


---------95:32----------
that works out fine if i share


---------95:35----------
responsibility with her and she takes a


---------95:37----------
hundred percent


---------95:38----------
that's not gonna work yeah okay if i


---------95:41----------
blame her 100


---------95:42----------
and she blames me 100 that's fine


---------95:45----------
[Laughter]


---------95:47----------
the problem is when i take 100


---------95:49----------
responsibility and she gives me 100


---------95:51----------
responsibility


---------95:52----------
that's what an abusive relationship


---------95:53----------
looks like i don't think you guys are an


---------95:55----------
abusive relationship i'm saying like


---------95:56----------
that's how they get them right because


---------95:58----------
it's like always one person's fault


---------96:02----------
and this whole thing with the water


---------96:03----------
boiling thing is an example


---------96:05----------
of like evan doesn't actually blame you


---------96:10----------
so when he when you turn off the water


---------96:12----------
then he gets upset because like actually


---------96:14----------
i don't want you to stop yeah


---------96:16----------
oh that's a great that's a great example


---------96:17----------
yeah right see he gets it i remember


---------96:19----------
right now yeah


---------96:20----------
so like what pisses you off when she


---------96:22----------
turns off the water kettle


---------96:24----------
it's like a um and i guess this almost


---------96:27----------
transitions to what i'm saying or


---------96:29----------
what we talked about which is that like


---------96:30----------
that's not what i meant


---------96:32----------
when i say like i hate this like i hate


---------96:34----------
the stove because it sucks like


---------96:37----------
i didn't want you to take the blame


---------96:39----------
there you know like that wasn't


---------96:41----------
me trying to put anything onto you that


---------96:44----------
was just me expressing


---------96:46----------
my my feelings that just arise um


---------96:49----------
and yeah i think it goes


---------96:53----------
it circles around to like just being


---------96:54----------
understood and like feeling like


---------96:57----------
what i am like that you're on the same


---------97:00----------
page as me and that like


---------97:02----------
it's uh yeah okay okay any thoughts


---------97:06----------
before we're gonna let evan go then any


---------97:08----------
any responses or thoughts alexa


---------97:11----------
yeah i guess i'm just like seeing how


---------97:13----------
these


---------97:14----------
like self-blaming behaviors are making


---------97:17----------
it harder for you to feel heard


---------97:19----------
in our relationship when that's not my


---------97:21----------
intention at all


---------97:22----------
so this is very helpful to hear yeah


---------97:26----------
do you feel heard evan


---------97:31----------
um when she said that yes


---------97:35----------
okay right like so do you feel like she


---------97:37----------
gets it


---------97:38----------
yes okay right right there is uh and


---------97:41----------
while she was saying it i got it in a


---------97:43----------
way in a new way that i have


---------97:45----------
where like i've circled around this


---------97:48----------
thing before but the way you put it


---------97:50----------
actually like yeah clicks something in


---------97:52----------
my brain as well which is that like my


---------97:54----------
understanding thing connects to your


---------97:57----------
like self-blaming thing like this is


---------98:00----------
that's the


---------98:02----------
those two forces combined which is like


---------98:03----------
my thing in your thing


---------98:05----------
yeah to faster yeah yeah yeah


---------98:08----------
that's how see it's both eels [ __ ]


---------98:11----------
fall


---------98:13----------
good message okay so evan you want to


---------98:17----------
you want to share recap um


---------98:20----------
yeah so we


---------98:24----------
as mentioned talked about um


---------98:27----------
i guess whether or not i feel understood


---------98:31----------
by you


---------98:32----------
and um


---------98:35----------
like what that like yeah


---------98:40----------
what that brings up with me and like why


---------98:42----------
i


---------98:43----------
do that and a lot of


---------98:47----------
we talked a lot about my


---------98:50----------
feeling of independence and like lost


---------98:54----------
opportunity


---------98:56----------
throughout time being in this


---------98:57----------
relationship


---------98:59----------
and that yeah i have some


---------99:02----------
uh i identify with


---------99:05----------
like the things we said when we started


---------99:09----------
this relationship still and i feel like


---------99:10----------
a responsibility


---------99:12----------
to do that what to what things facebook


---------99:15----------
like


---------99:16----------
uh like big picture like you know we big


---------99:18----------
picture like


---------99:19----------
yeah yeah um and


---------99:24----------
that i don't want to like


---------99:27----------
misstep but i also need to change


---------99:31----------
and it's hard for me to do that do both


---------99:34----------
of those things


---------99:35----------
in the like context of our relationship


---------99:38----------
or just in the context of your life


---------99:41----------
both i don't know um


---------99:45----------
okay explain what you mean evan by


---------99:47----------
misstep and change


---------99:50----------
um what's the sentence i use them in i


---------99:52----------
don't remember


---------99:53----------
okay so i'm sorry i'm i'm not following


---------99:55----------
my own rules


---------99:56----------
so alexa what did you hear from evan


---------99:59----------
okay what i heard


---------100:01----------
is that um i think at times


---------100:05----------
you do not feel understood


---------100:08----------
by me and that


---------100:12----------
you are finding it hard to change


---------100:15----------
and grow in some way and that um


---------100:22----------
you want to change and grow but you also


---------100:24----------
want to like honor


---------100:25----------
the like foundings like the


---------100:28----------
foundation of our relationship


---------100:33----------
yeah i think yeah i think that's what i


---------100:35----------
heard i agree with that okay


---------100:37----------
i i like to honor the foundations of the


---------100:39----------
relationship that sounds


---------100:42----------
yeah they're the house building


---------100:45----------
we started digging a hole yeah okay


---------100:48----------
so uh evan are there other things that


---------100:50----------
you want to share or that you took away


---------100:52----------
from our conversation


---------100:55----------
um


---------101:02----------
nothing comes to mind okay i'm blinking


---------101:04----------
right now yep so i think i'm gonna add a


---------101:06----------
couple of things so


---------101:08----------
um so the first thing is that that


---------101:11----------
you know evan you talked about feeling


---------101:14----------
stagnant


---------101:16----------
right and what did you can you share a


---------101:19----------
little bit with


---------101:20----------
with alexa about how you feel about that


---------101:24----------
uh sure i guess that


---------101:28----------
like yeah i've seen people do


---------101:31----------
a lot of things and i often


---------101:34----------
compare like our relationship to


---------101:39----------
what i could have done in five years


---------101:41----------
okay almost


---------101:42----------
um and like that i


---------101:45----------
know that that's not obv that's not the


---------101:48----------
case and that


---------101:49----------
i can change in this relationship but


---------101:51----------
that um


---------101:54----------
it yeah i there's some like


---------101:58----------
part of me that it feels like safe being


---------102:02----------
18 year old us who is just like in our


---------102:05----------
parents basements you know it's very


---------102:07----------
there's a very uh comforting


---------102:10----------
feeling that like recreating that yeah


---------102:12----------
recreating that


---------102:14----------
is like satisfying but


---------102:18----------
the other side of that coin is uh


---------102:21----------
there's like gnawing away at like always


---------102:24----------
staying


---------102:26----------
on a path of uh like


---------102:29----------
certainty rather than kind of seeing


---------102:33----------
like go venturing out yeah yeah making


---------102:35----------
my world bigger


---------102:36----------
yeah what did you hear alexa


---------102:40----------
um i heard that over time you've seen


---------102:45----------
other people you're close to in your


---------102:46----------
life change and that


---------102:49----------
you haven't seen that change in yourself


---------102:51----------
and you wonder


---------102:52----------
if like our relationship is somehow


---------102:56----------
connected to that


---------102:58----------
um and then you


---------103:01----------
like okay you um


---------103:06----------
you want to like see yourself in a


---------103:08----------
different way than how you saw yourself


---------103:11----------
when you were 18 and we started dating


---------103:13----------
and that


---------103:14----------
uh i think what i hear is that you want


---------103:17----------
room in the relationship to grow


---------103:19----------
to like allow you the personal uh


---------103:23----------
bandwidth i guess to do that to like


---------103:26----------
achieve new personal things and explore


---------103:28----------
new things


---------103:29----------
but at times you feel like you can't


---------103:31----------
because of our the context of our


---------103:32----------
relationship


---------103:34----------
yeah yeah um i guess


---------103:38----------
the one caveat i would add to that is


---------103:41----------
that like i don't


---------103:43----------
uh know what i need you know like


---------103:47----------
whatever space in a relationship means i


---------103:49----------
don't


---------103:50----------
i i guess i need some and it is i like


---------103:53----------
that you use the word wonder because


---------103:54----------
it is a lot of wonder and like


---------103:57----------
hypothesizing over


---------103:59----------
like oh sh what is this the thing like


---------104:01----------
should i sacrifice this relationship is


---------104:03----------
that what will make me change


---------104:04----------
yeah um but i think you got the i think


---------104:08----------
you have the idea


---------104:08----------
okay okay how does it feel to hear the


---------104:11----------
phrase


---------104:13----------
is sacrificing the relationship what i


---------104:15----------
need to change


---------104:16----------
what do you think about that alexa i


---------104:19----------
think it's a legitimate


---------104:20----------
wonder right like we have made a


---------104:23----------
long-term commitment to each other


---------104:25----------
whoops um


---------104:28----------
and like i've been on an easy path i


---------104:31----------
think in life where i went to school and


---------104:33----------
then i graduated


---------104:34----------
and then i got into this grad program


---------104:36----------
and it's been easy for me to see


---------104:37----------
development but for you


---------104:39----------
it hasn't been that laid out and the


---------104:41----------
only like consistent thing has been our


---------104:43----------
relationship


---------104:44----------
so you've kind of had to use our like


---------104:45----------
relationship as a landmark i think the


---------104:48----------
question is like


---------104:50----------
in the absence of those like landmarks


---------104:52----------
in our relationship what would you do


---------104:54----------
or what could you have done yeah


---------104:57----------
fantastic okay can i share a couple of


---------105:01----------
additional things


---------105:03----------
please so um evan what do you think


---------105:05----------
about how much you gain


---------105:08----------
um


---------105:12----------
it goes in waves and i


---------105:16----------
feel like i have some self-awareness


---------105:19----------
over it


---------105:21----------
but when it does come i do


---------105:24----------
not like how much it is all right i do


---------105:27----------
recognize the uh


---------105:29----------
kind of escapism that it offers me okay


---------105:33----------
okay so we're going to talk for a second


---------105:34----------
about gaming


---------105:36----------
so i think sometimes alexa picks up


---------105:39----------
guilt from you about your feelings of


---------105:43----------
gaming


---------105:44----------
and she also feels frustrated that


---------105:47----------
sometimes it feels like bizarrely


---------105:51----------
i think you guys actually agree here so


---------105:52----------
at one point we had sort of


---------105:54----------
you had said something about


---------105:58----------
you know feeling stagnant or something


---------106:01----------
and then she responds by like


---------106:04----------
invalidating what you say by


---------106:06----------
pointing to things about what you guys


---------106:07----------
like say like you know


---------106:09----------
when you guys have done stuff together


---------106:11----------
yeah yeah


---------106:13----------
and so the funny thing is that she


---------106:15----------
actually kind of feels the same way


---------106:16----------
because


---------106:16----------
she sort of feels like sometimes with


---------106:19----------
gaming she's like


---------106:20----------
a housewife kind of twiddling her thumbs


---------106:22----------
like she'll be out doing stuff and then


---------106:23----------
she'll kind of come home and you'll be


---------106:24----------
like


---------106:25----------
gaming and then she'll be like okay what


---------106:27----------
else like so sometimes it's sort of like


---------106:28----------
she's not sure


---------106:30----------
when she's playing a single player game


---------106:32----------
and when she's playing a co-op game


---------106:35----------
yeah yeah yeah cause i'm literally just


---------106:38----------
playing a


---------106:38----------
game with different random people yeah


---------106:40----------
right right so so i think she expressed


---------106:42----------
some frustration


---------106:44----------
around that which it took some work


---------106:47----------
for her to even be able to say that she


---------106:49----------
was kind of frustrated with that so


---------106:50----------
strong work


---------106:52----------
alexa but but i i think you guys really


---------106:54----------
have to look at the gaming because i


---------106:56----------
think it is


---------106:57----------
i think like a loss of potential


---------107:00----------
i've certainly seen relationships that


---------107:03----------
fall apart


---------107:04----------
followed by immense growth on the part


---------107:06----------
of a gamer


---------107:07----------
but it's not because the relationship


---------107:09----------
fell apart it's usually


---------107:11----------
honestly the situation is girl dumps guy


---------107:14----------
guys like oh [ __ ] i have to get my act


---------107:16----------
together and then like cuts back on his


---------107:18----------
gaming


---------107:19----------
okay yes and and so i think if there's


---------107:21----------
any sort of lawson


---------107:23----------
of potential it sounds like evan how


---------107:25----------
many how many hours do you play on


---------107:27----------
on average per week um


---------107:31----------
since we moved i will probably play


---------107:34----------
15 to 20 i think before that yeah


---------107:38----------
like during early covet i could easily


---------107:40----------
log


---------107:42----------
40 to 50. okay and what about like one


---------107:44----------
year ago


---------107:46----------
oh i mean that last summer was


---------107:50----------
was not a good summer necessarily and


---------107:52----------
that was probably


---------107:53----------
you're you're 60 or 70. yep that's what


---------107:55----------
i mean i think


---------107:56----------
everyone watching twitch was aware of


---------107:57----------
that yes you know i think we can tell


---------108:01----------
um so so i i'm proud yeah


---------108:04----------
so i mean that's us we we recognize


---------108:06----------
ourselves


---------108:08----------
um so i i think the other thing in terms


---------108:10----------
of your stagnation and your lack of


---------108:12----------
growth like


---------108:13----------
if you're pounding out 60 hours a year


---------108:15----------
ago like that's why you're not growing


---------108:17----------
it's not because you've been dating the


---------108:18----------
same chick for four years


---------108:20----------
yeah right like to be blocked and


---------108:23----------
and yes um you know so i think that's


---------108:26----------
something that you guys are gonna have


---------108:27----------
to work on especially because


---------108:29----------
uh you know evan you do have it sounds


---------108:31----------
like sometimes you get


---------108:32----------
angry very easily which is also common


---------108:34----------
for people who play a lot of league of


---------108:36----------
legends


---------108:37----------
and dota and games in general cs go you


---------108:39----------
can take it call it whatever you want


---------108:42----------
um the one other thing that i want to


---------108:43----------
point out so i think you guys really


---------108:45----------
have to look at that


---------108:46----------
and evan what you really need to do is


---------108:48----------
think about


---------108:49----------
what ways do you want your life to


---------108:51----------
change


---------108:52----------
and then what you need to do alexa is


---------108:54----------
when he tells you his want


---------108:56----------
he wants his life to change in a


---------108:57----------
particular way you can't make it your


---------109:00----------
fault


---------109:01----------
okay his life is the way that's the


---------109:03----------
worst thing that you can do


---------109:04----------
and here's the other thing the


---------109:05----------
connection so i'm glad you guys are able


---------109:07----------
to see that like some of your problems


---------109:09----------
are not your fault or her fault it's


---------109:12----------
what you guys combine together


---------109:14----------
so earlier we were talking about evan


---------109:16----------
being the judge and how he's like


---------109:17----------
basically like


---------109:18----------
judges you right and then that makes you


---------109:20----------
feel bad


---------109:21----------
so that also you guys can go back and


---------109:23----------
watch the pod but i think the other


---------109:25----------
interesting thing is that like


---------109:26----------
you like to be the judge and then she


---------109:28----------
also likes to be the accused


---------109:32----------
right that's very well put yeah and so


---------109:35----------
it's like


---------109:35----------
like y'all are both falling into that


---------109:37----------
pattern because both of you feel


---------109:39----------
comfortable with it


---------109:40----------
so she likes to be the accused because


---------109:42----------
she's the mediator she you know it's


---------109:43----------
adaptive in an academic setting


---------109:45----------
you've got to figure out where that


---------109:47----------
judgeness comes from


---------109:49----------
and and so kind of just notice that


---------109:51----------
these patterns that you guys have


---------109:52----------
are like something that you guys create


---------109:54----------
together


---------109:56----------
um but but i really i i mean


---------109:59----------
yeah so so thoughts any questions about


---------110:01----------
that


---------110:04----------
um maybe a question of like


---------110:07----------
so i yeah set um


---------110:12----------
i guess like set standards for what not


---------110:14----------
standard i don't know


---------110:16----------
get an idea of what i want moving


---------110:18----------
forward and realistically what that


---------110:19----------
looks like


---------110:20----------
um sometimes i worry about like


---------110:22----------
involving her too much


---------110:24----------
in that goal so if it is like stop


---------110:27----------
like gain less like only only game on


---------110:30----------
friday saturday sunday or something and


---------110:31----------
the rest of the time is like


---------110:32----------
dedicated to work days or something um


---------110:37----------
like i i worry of like involving her in


---------110:40----------
that and


---------110:40----------
having putting a responsibility on her


---------110:43----------
and holding me accountable


---------110:44----------
yep that's your independence streak


---------110:48----------
you see it you want to do it on your own


---------110:51----------
yes


---------110:52----------
right so just because so yes i i should


---------110:55----------
ask her for help


---------110:56----------
well that's something you've got to sort


---------110:58----------
through


---------110:59----------
so maybe i should just start blaming you


---------111:01----------
when you came outside of fred


---------111:03----------
friday saturday yes and so we're going


---------111:06----------
to talk about things that are going to


---------111:07----------
torpedo your relationship in a second


---------111:09----------
but evan i get what you're saying


---------111:12----------
because i think you're someone who


---------111:13----------
much like antidepressants wants to learn


---------111:15----------
how to do it on your own


---------111:18----------
right so i'm not saying that there's a


---------111:19----------
right answer or a wrong answer there


---------111:22----------
but like i i think that it may be


---------111:24----------
possible to recruit her


---------111:26----------
in some ways but i think if you use her


---------111:28----------
as an accountability tool


---------111:29----------
it's going to piss both of you off okay


---------111:32----------
she can't make you accountable i think


---------111:34----------
what she can do


---------111:36----------
and this is something you've got to work


---------111:37----------
on alexa is recognize that when he comes


---------111:39----------
to you with a problem he's not looking


---------111:41----------
for you to fix it


---------111:43----------
he's actually just looking for you to


---------111:45----------
listen and this is bizarre because this


---------111:46----------
is like


---------111:47----------
really a gender reversal in traditional


---------111:49----------
heteronormative relationships


---------111:51----------
we're very proud of that yeah so usually


---------111:53----------
it's the woman


---------111:54----------
who will express some frustration and


---------111:58----------
then the man is like how do i fix it


---------112:01----------
and then it's like she doesn't want you


---------112:02----------
to fix it she just wants you to listen


---------112:05----------
so alexa i think sometimes when evan is


---------112:07----------
like i don't know what to do in our


---------112:08----------
relationship


---------112:09----------
and then you're like what can i do to


---------112:10----------
make it better that's not what he wants


---------112:12----------
from


---------112:13----------
okay what question would be more


---------112:15----------
productive to ask


---------112:16----------
or what what's a better response


---------112:19----------
what feels like it's unproductive in our


---------112:21----------
relationship or


---------112:23----------
why do you feel like you're stagnant


---------112:25----------
just try to understand


---------112:26----------
don't try to fix don't try to help try


---------112:29----------
to understand


---------112:30----------
first and foremost


---------112:34----------
okay tell me more period not even a


---------112:37----------
question oh yeah


---------112:38----------
okay and then what and then what you can


---------112:40----------
do is you can employ


---------112:42----------
i think in general instead of sitting in


---------112:44----------
silence with each other while y'all are


---------112:46----------
eating your food


---------112:47----------
try doing so recognize that the emotions


---------112:51----------
are going to come up and then try doing


---------112:52----------
what we did today


---------112:53----------
which is just repeat back what the other


---------112:55----------
person said don't respond to it


---------112:58----------
i like that yeah okay and then you guys


---------113:00----------
are gonna get on the same page


---------113:02----------
okay it's really hard to do by the way


---------113:05----------
okay


---------113:05----------
it's easy to do here with a referee but


---------113:07----------
like when y'all are pissed off


---------113:09----------
and when you're it's alexisfalt.exe is


---------113:12----------
active


---------113:13----------
then it's hard to do but you guys have


---------113:15----------
to pull yourselves out and and really


---------113:17----------
try to practice okay okay thank you


---------113:21----------
last thing that i'll say is that so the


---------113:24----------
question is should we break up


---------113:26----------
and my answer is maybe so here's what


---------113:28----------
i'll say


---------113:29----------
i think you guys are not the people that


---------113:31----------
you were five years ago


---------113:33----------
and this relationship is not what it was


---------113:35----------
five years ago


---------113:37----------
so the question should you guys can you


---------113:40----------
continue this relationship


---------113:41----------
absolutely not the question is can the


---------113:44----------
two of you


---------113:45----------
grow as individuals and evolve your


---------113:49----------
relationship into what it needs to be


---------113:51----------
now which is not what it was five years


---------113:53----------
ago


---------113:54----------
that what evan needed was safety and


---------113:57----------
support


---------113:58----------
and someone else to take the blame when


---------114:00----------
he felt like things were his fault


---------114:01----------
because he lacked confidence and all


---------114:03----------
this kind of [ __ ]


---------114:04----------
right i'm just hypothesizing there you


---------114:07----------
guys can


---------114:09----------
right and but now what what he needed


---------114:11----------
five years ago alexa is different from


---------114:13----------
what he needs from you now


---------114:16----------
which is like the exact thing that made


---------114:18----------
your relationship


---------114:19----------
so valuable is now the very thing that's


---------114:22----------
keeping it from growing


---------114:24----------
yeah and so i think both of you guys


---------114:26----------
need to grow


---------114:27----------
as people as individuals and then see if


---------114:30----------
you guys can like continue to evolve but


---------114:33----------
generally speaking i'm hopeful


---------114:35----------
right but like that you y'all both


---------114:37----------
unfortunately do have to acknowledge


---------114:38----------
that like


---------114:39----------
you know people who get together when


---------114:40----------
they're 17 don't stay together for their


---------114:42----------
entire life all the time


---------114:44----------
and i think the ones who do it are the


---------114:46----------
ones who recognize that like you guys


---------114:48----------
are starting a new relationship


---------114:50----------
now with each other that each of you is


---------114:52----------
evolving and changing and if you guys


---------114:53----------
can support each other and doing that


---------114:55----------
at some point it sounds to me like


---------114:57----------
there's enough good stuff there that


---------114:59----------
it's like you know worth giving it a try


---------115:03----------
but you all aren't going to be 17 year


---------115:04----------
olds for the rest of your life so you


---------115:06----------
can't preserve that relationship


---------115:08----------
and in fact it's trying to preserve that


---------115:10----------
relationship where a lot of like sadness


---------115:12----------
and suffering comes from


---------115:16----------
right yeah yeah yeah i think


---------115:20----------
i really like a lot of what you said


---------115:21----------
especially gather like


---------115:23----------
we needed something then and


---------115:26----------
we need something now and we're not the


---------115:29----------
same people and


---------115:30----------
i like the idea of like it's a new


---------115:33----------
relationship yeah


---------115:34----------
it's a new type of relationship yeah uh


---------115:37----------
at


---------115:37----------
in each new stage right at all times


---------115:41----------
yeah yeah


---------115:41----------
yeah so like for another good example


---------115:45----------
of what is a new relationship is like if


---------115:47----------
you guys have kids one day


---------115:49----------
then you're just not the same people you


---------115:52----------
were after you have kids


---------115:54----------
your relationship completely changes


---------115:55----------
right so that's an example of a common


---------115:57----------
evolution


---------115:58----------
in relationships that sometimes end up


---------116:00----------
fracturing


---------116:01----------
relationships right which is okay


---------116:05----------
okay last thoughts or questions


---------116:09----------
um like how do i


---------116:13----------
stop myself from this like self-blaming


---------116:16----------
dialogue


---------116:17----------
like are there any good questions i can


---------116:19----------
ask myself when evan says like


---------116:21----------
points it out uh so


---------116:24----------
what i would say first and foremost is


---------116:26----------
you have to notice it


---------116:28----------
so you can even go back and watch the


---------116:29----------
vod and see what happened and try to


---------116:31----------
remember what happened in your mind


---------116:33----------
because you did shut it off it's really


---------116:35----------
just noticing because


---------116:36----------
when when that programming activates you


---------116:39----------
think it's fact


---------116:41----------
you don't realize that it is a program


---------116:43----------
in your mind that's running


---------116:46----------
and so just recognizing that oh [ __ ] my


---------116:48----------
mind is gonna do its thing again


---------116:50----------
like think about your mind like kind of


---------116:52----------
like a


---------116:53----------
you know like a bad leg that sometimes


---------116:56----------
gives out


---------116:57----------
and it's like it's not your fault it's


---------116:59----------
just like the leg sometimes poops out


---------117:01----------
it's like it's just doing its thing


---------117:02----------
again so your mind is gonna do its thing


---------117:04----------
and there may be some triggers


---------117:06----------
like criticism or feeling like or


---------117:10----------
actually bizarrely


---------117:11----------
yours may not be triggered by criticism


---------117:13----------
of you it may be triggered by


---------117:15----------
pain on the side of evan


---------117:18----------
right actually that's what the trigger


---------117:20----------
is so that's what's weird is it's like


---------117:21----------
when


---------117:21----------
evan expressed his frustration about


---------117:24----------
something in his life


---------117:25----------
you're like how can i make this my fault


---------117:27----------
and take the pain away from you evan


---------117:30----------
and then when you do that like you gotta


---------117:32----------
notice when she does it and try to point


---------117:33----------
it out and be like hey are you taking my


---------117:35----------
pain away just ask her


---------117:39----------
yeah and then you guys figure it out


---------117:41----------
mm-hmm


---------117:42----------
yeah yeah okay thank you that's given a


---------117:44----------
lot of words


---------117:45----------
to a lot of vague feelings feelings


---------117:49----------
like acted out over time that's what we


---------117:52----------
do here


---------117:52----------
okay so last question is do you all want


---------117:55----------
to learn how to meditate


---------117:57----------
let's do it yes okay so this is i think


---------118:00----------
this is going to be fun so we're going


---------118:01----------
to do om chanting we haven't done it in


---------118:03----------
a little while


---------118:04----------
but i think home chanting is especially


---------118:06----------
good if you guys want to be


---------118:07----------
partners oh good then because champions


---------118:10----------
we still do stream chat


---------118:14----------
um so if you guys uh so i think om


---------118:17----------
chanting is actually good to


---------118:18----------
like it's actually better when you do it


---------118:20----------
with other people


---------118:22----------
so what i want you guys so we're gonna


---------118:24----------
do it together


---------118:25----------
okay okay so i want you all to sit up


---------118:28----------
straight


---------118:31----------
okay um so i'm gonna demonstrate so om


---------118:34----------
is composed of three syllables


---------118:36----------
ah and and then


---------118:39----------
i understand that sometimes on discord


---------118:41----------
it cuts out so let me actually try to


---------118:43----------
let me know if it cuts out okay because


---------118:45----------
i think discord's voice activation


---------118:48----------
algorithm like chops it it happens okay


---------118:50----------
on stream but


---------118:52----------
so what i'm gonna do uh so i'm gonna


---------118:53----------
start with


---------118:54----------
[Music]


---------118:58----------
that you guys hear that we heard


---------119:07----------
right so you go from a fully open mouth


---------119:13----------
to a fully closed map okay okay okay so


---------119:15----------
one or two things to remember about


---------119:17----------
chanting


---------119:17----------
one is chanting is not about sound it's


---------119:20----------
about vibration


---------119:21----------
so you don't want to focus on what you


---------119:23----------
hear you want to focus on what you


---------119:25----------
feel okay people feel anxious


---------119:29----------
when they start to chant because let's


---------119:31----------
be honest


---------119:32----------
it's [ __ ] weird and then the the goal


---------119:35----------
though


---------119:36----------
is that like notice that anxiety within


---------119:39----------
you and then like start focusing on the


---------119:41----------
vibration


---------119:42----------
and as you chant the anxiety will just


---------119:44----------
like


---------119:45----------
fade away which is also useful


---------119:48----------
okay so i'm gonna demonstrate with


---------119:51----------
three breaths and then we're gonna do


---------119:54----------
three breaths together


---------119:55----------
i'll demonstrate with two let's say and


---------119:57----------
then we'll do three together okay so


---------120:18----------
did that clip out entirely oh yeah okay


---------120:21----------
so hold on one second okay let me just


---------120:24----------
fix this let me move to push to talk


---------120:31----------
and then hopefully this works okay


---------120:35----------
all right so i'm going to try one more


---------120:36----------
time with push to talk no we don't hear


---------120:38----------
you


---------120:39----------
oh yeah i need to try now


---------120:43----------
that is the okay keyword one more time


---------120:55----------
[Music]


---------121:06----------
you guys hear it that time yeah okay


---------121:08----------
great is that one


---------121:10----------
that's one okay okay so we're gonna do


---------121:14----------
three breaths now okay in succession


---------121:17----------
with eyes closed


---------121:18----------
okay all right so sit up straight


---------121:21----------
youtube twitch chat big deep breath


---------121:44----------
okay big deep breath


---------121:57----------
[Music]


---------122:02----------
ah


---------122:04----------
[Music]


---------122:16----------
again


---------122:26----------
[Music]


---------122:28----------
four more deep breath in


---------122:41----------
[Music]


---------122:47----------
[Laughter]


---------122:50----------
[Music]


---------122:58----------
in


---------123:07----------
[Laughter]


---------123:13----------
[Music]


---------123:16----------
two more deep breath in


---------123:33----------
[Laughter]


---------123:37----------
[Music]


---------123:41----------
last one make it count


---------124:05----------
now we're just gonna sit about 30 to 60


---------124:08----------
seconds


---------124:31----------
all right


---------124:50----------
okay


---------125:01----------
okay


---------125:04----------
go ahead and come on back


---------125:13----------
go ahead and come on back i forgot that


---------125:16----------
i


---------125:16----------
should talk how do you feel


---------125:23----------
very peaceful very yeah my mind is very


---------125:29----------
at ease cool


---------125:34----------
so maybe that'll help you guys so it's a


---------125:37----------
good practice that you all can do


---------125:38----------
together did you guys


---------125:40----------
harmonize or resonate with each other we


---------125:42----------
couldn't really hear you but


---------125:47----------
i don't know i i


---------125:50----------
while we were chanting i definitely felt


---------125:52----------
a sense of


---------125:53----------
uh like yeah for sure like anxiety at


---------125:57----------
the beginning but


---------125:58----------
once we were in it um i was losing


---------126:02----------
track of my voice versus her voice


---------126:04----------
versus


---------126:05----------
coming through my earbud voice great


---------126:08----------
that's the whole point yeah yeah so you


---------126:11----------
want to lose track of


---------126:12----------
the individual


---------126:16----------
cool well thank you guys very much for


---------126:18----------
coming on any last thoughts or questions


---------126:20----------
before we wrap up


---------126:23----------
maybe no i would just like to say thank


---------126:25----------
you know what therapist i've seen for


---------126:27----------
the past


---------126:28----------
seven years he's been as insightful and


---------126:30----------
blunt with me as you have and i really


---------126:31----------
appreciate that


---------126:33----------
just a reminder this isn't therapy


---------126:35----------
though yeah yeah i know i know


---------126:37----------
it's a nice friendly conversation yeah


---------126:39----------
so i mean


---------126:40----------
i think yeah it's it's strange because


---------126:42----------
oftentimes with my actual therapy


---------126:44----------
patients i will not be as insightful or


---------126:46----------
as blunt


---------126:48----------
because therapy is a longer process and


---------126:52----------
you know i think we just have two hours


---------126:54----------
with you all so


---------126:55----------
gotta make it count well thank you i


---------126:58----------
think you did


---------126:59----------
so we very much appreciate it yeah of


---------127:01----------
course man so we're rooting for you


---------127:02----------
twitch chat is rooting for you but


---------127:04----------
doesn't mean that you have to stay


---------127:05----------
together


---------127:06----------
but i think we're all in your corner and


---------127:08----------
so good luck


---------127:09----------
thank you thank you very much thank you


---------127:12----------
guys very much for coming on and


---------127:13----------
sharing so much because i think this


---------127:15----------
really helps everyone


---------127:17----------
yeah strong work we hope so have a good


---------127:19----------
day you too


---------127:20----------
you too thanks
