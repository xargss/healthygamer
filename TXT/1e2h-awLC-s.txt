---------00:00----------
it felt like an oasis of sanity in a


---------00:02----------
crazy world


---------00:04----------
and so it's not that unusual that there


---------00:06----------
would be a guidance counselor there that


---------00:08----------
would know about


---------00:08----------
lsd research thanks a lot for coming


---------00:11----------
rick so we're live


---------00:13----------
um just so let me just introduce you


---------00:15----------
again so this is


---------00:16----------
a rick doblin he's the founder and


---------00:19----------
executive director of maps which is the


---------00:21----------
multidisciplinary association for


---------00:23----------
psychedelic studies


---------00:24----------
i know that uh a lot of our community


---------00:27----------
has been very interested in psychedelics


---------00:28----------
recently there's been a lot


---------00:30----------
of uh studies that have come out showing


---------00:32----------
the potential benefits


---------00:34----------
of using psychedelics um as mental


---------00:36----------
health treatments and i know


---------00:38----------
other will kind of get into how it has


---------00:40----------
additional uses


---------00:42----------
um and so i i think a lot of that


---------00:45----------
frankly is due to you rick because maps


---------00:47----------
has been funding studies and


---------00:49----------
you've been a long-term proponent for


---------00:51----------
decades


---------00:53----------
since 1986 is when i started maps but


---------00:57----------
but really since 1972


---------00:59----------
when i was 18 when i decided to focus on


---------01:02----------
psychedelics


---------01:03----------
yeah so thank you so much for all of


---------01:05----------
your hard work and dedication because i


---------01:07----------
i do think that psychedelics are going


---------01:09----------
to offer a really wonderful opportunity


---------01:12----------
in psychiatry um just a quick disclaimer


---------01:15----------
that you know psychedelics are currently


---------01:16----------
not


---------01:17----------
really medically approved treatments for


---------01:18----------
anything so um


---------01:20----------
you know we don't really re or i don't


---------01:22----------
recommend that you guys use them


---------01:23----------
we'll talk a little bit more about that


---------01:25----------
um so


---------01:27----------
you know in the studies as i understand


---------01:28----------
them are done in relatively controlled


---------01:30----------
environments


---------01:31----------
with controlled dosing and sort of a


---------01:34----------
certain amount of


---------01:35----------
purity of like what people are using so


---------01:37----------
a lot of times things are contaminated


---------01:40----------
and so you know steer clear of that but


---------01:42----------
rick i i know you may disagree


---------01:45----------
well um i i think our clinical studies


---------01:48----------
are done in a highly controlled


---------01:49----------
environment with


---------01:50----------
pre-screened patients with


---------01:53----------
medical tests to make sure that they're


---------01:57----------
fine


---------01:58----------
to handle the experience and then it's a


---------02:01----------
two-person therapy team


---------02:04----------
with them for eight hours and there's


---------02:06----------
been preparation and


---------02:07----------
integration so yeah it's a highly


---------02:10----------
controlled environment


---------02:12----------
um but i i do think that um


---------02:15----------
some of the most important experiences


---------02:17----------
i've had um


---------02:19----------
after i was quite familiar with


---------02:22----------
psychedelics was doing them on my own in


---------02:24----------
the woods in nature


---------02:26----------
um some once actually on my own in a


---------02:29----------
flotation tank


---------02:30----------
for 17 hours oh wow


---------02:33----------
with a big dose of lsd


---------02:37----------
so i i do think that it's wise to have


---------02:39----------
somebody


---------02:40----------
that's not under the influence of


---------02:43----------
psychedelics kind of like a designated


---------02:44----------
driver


---------02:46----------
because you can go deeper when you feel


---------02:48----------
really safe and you're not worried about


---------02:51----------
the interaction with the outside world


---------02:52----------
somebody at the door the phone or


---------02:54----------
anything like that


---------02:56----------
um and also i i do think that


---------03:00----------
there is a lot to be uh gained from


---------03:04----------
other contexts than therapeutic context


---------03:07----------
but but the concern i have there is just


---------03:09----------
that


---------03:10----------
when people take them in more of a what


---------03:12----------
you would say recreational or


---------03:14----------
celebratory context


---------03:15----------
if you're just doing it to have fun one


---------03:18----------
of the big dangers is that when


---------03:19----------
difficult stuff comes up


---------03:21----------
and psychedelics do kind of impact this


---------03:24----------
membrane between the unconscious and the


---------03:25----------
unconscious mind and


---------03:26----------
things that are emotionally charged come


---------03:28----------
to the surface if you're just trying to


---------03:30----------
have fun


---------03:31----------
and something difficult comes up if you


---------03:33----------
try to stuff it down


---------03:34----------
and not focus on it you could end up


---------03:36----------
worse off for months or years later


---------03:38----------
so i think the attitude going into it


---------03:42----------
is very important regardless of whether


---------03:44----------
it's a therapeutic setting or


---------03:46----------
any kind of settings back in the 80s


---------03:49----------
when mdma was first being


---------03:52----------
well it was middle 70s actually that


---------03:55----------
mdma under the code name adam was first


---------03:57----------
being used


---------03:58----------
in therapy settings and then eventually


---------04:00----------
escaped


---------04:02----------
out of those therapeutic settings and


---------04:03----------
was used uh recreationally under the


---------04:05----------
name ecstasy


---------04:07----------
there was still sasha shulgin who was


---------04:09----------
the chemist that


---------04:10----------
really helped pioneer this whole area


---------04:12----------
and sort of rediscovered


---------04:14----------
mdma he and his wife anne had a several


---------04:17----------
page mimeographed information sheet that


---------04:20----------
they handed out along with the drug and


---------04:22----------
and


---------04:22----------
it ended up with remember there is no


---------04:24----------
such thing as a casual experiment


---------04:26----------
experiment you do have to take it


---------04:29----------
seriously


---------04:30----------
even though it may not be in a


---------04:32----------
therapeutic or


---------04:34----------
religious uh spiritual setting it's


---------04:36----------
still you shouldn't underestimate these


---------04:38----------
substances and just don't approach it


---------04:40----------
casually yeah


---------04:42----------
so rick just in that vein i've actually


---------04:44----------
had a lot of people reach out saying


---------04:46----------
that they've had


---------04:47----------
ptsd or anxiety develop after


---------04:50----------
using lsd or other psychedelics what do


---------04:53----------
you think about that


---------04:56----------
um i think that that's um very


---------04:59----------
it's not uncommon i mean again it's when


---------05:02----------
you take these situa


---------05:03----------
lsd and psilocybin and


---------05:06----------
the classic psychedelics operate by


---------05:09----------
dissolving your sense of self


---------05:11----------
you know which can lead to this sense of


---------05:14----------
deeper unity and connection but it also


---------05:16----------
helps um if people are are not feeling


---------05:19----------
safe in a way it can contribute to


---------05:22----------
people


---------05:23----------
feeling like they're losing their mind


---------05:24----------
or that often we are so identified with


---------05:27----------
our ego with our sense of who we


---------05:29----------
are that the ego dissolution is


---------05:31----------
sometimes confused with physical death


---------05:33----------
that ego death or ego dissolution is


---------05:35----------
often


---------05:36----------
confused with physical death um stan


---------05:39----------
groff


---------05:40----------
who's um sort of the world's leading lsd


---------05:42----------
researcher and therapist


---------05:45----------
um he started doing lsd research in the


---------05:47----------
50s in the czech republic he's 89 now


---------05:49----------
and we just published his book way of


---------05:50----------
the psychonaut for


---------05:52----------
encyclopedia in her journey so i highly


---------05:55----------
recommend that for people but he told a


---------05:56----------
story about how


---------05:57----------
he watched a bunch of people um


---------06:00----------
doing lsd before he ever did it himself


---------06:04----------
you know now these are patients and he


---------06:06----------
was the the psychiatrist in this part of


---------06:08----------
his training


---------06:09----------
and he saw how this confusion between


---------06:11----------
ego dissolution and ego death and


---------06:13----------
physical death


---------06:14----------
often manifests um and so when he had


---------06:18----------
his first lsd


---------06:19----------
experience and he started going through


---------06:21----------
that same thing he


---------06:23----------
uh for a temporarily he persuaded


---------06:25----------
himself that somehow or other because he


---------06:28----------
had had a


---------06:29----------
a special illness when he was like six


---------06:31----------
years old that that had altered his


---------06:34----------
body chemistry such that even though


---------06:38----------
he knew that other people when they


---------06:40----------
started feeling that they were dying it


---------06:42----------
was actually not true


---------06:43----------
for him he thought it was really true


---------06:44----------
because he had this


---------06:46----------
illness when he was six and it only took


---------06:48----------
him it took him a while to work through


---------06:49----------
that but


---------06:51----------
this just relates to your question that


---------06:52----------
people can uh


---------06:55----------
when difficult stuff comes up and you


---------06:56----------
try to um


---------06:58----------
push it down or you don't feel safe in


---------07:00----------
the context to explore it


---------07:03----------
you have now created a situation where


---------07:06----------
these memories that have been


---------07:07----------
unconscious are now sort of


---------07:09----------
halfway conscious halfway not and


---------07:13----------
you can have very difficult experiences


---------07:15----------
in therapeutic settings in the future


---------07:17----------
and also underground settings and i've


---------07:19----------
done this


---------07:20----------
um you know back before mdma was illegal


---------07:24----------
but you know when people have difficult


---------07:28----------
experiences with lsd or psilocybin


---------07:31----------
what you can do is give half a dose of


---------07:33----------
mdma


---------07:35----------
and what that does it's not like a


---------07:36----------
tranquilizer that sort of


---------07:38----------
tries to take you out of it and freezes


---------07:40----------
the conflict in place


---------07:42----------
but what it does is it reduces the fear


---------07:45----------
of whatever it is that you're concerned


---------07:47----------
about the fear of dying the fear of


---------07:48----------
going crazy


---------07:49----------
or traumatic memories that are coming up


---------07:51----------
and then you can process it


---------07:53----------
so that you know that would be the if


---------07:56----------
people go to the emergency rooms or


---------07:57----------
something because they've got a panic


---------07:59----------
attack from lsd the ideal solution and i


---------08:01----------
know emergency rooms aren't


---------08:02----------
prepared for this at least not yet would


---------08:05----------
be to give a half dose of mdma


---------08:07----------
and then keep them processing it and


---------08:09----------
provide that sort of support


---------08:11----------
interesting so rick you mentioned that


---------08:13----------
you've been doing


---------08:14----------
kind of you've been interested in


---------08:15----------
psychedelics for a long time can you


---------08:17----------
just


---------08:17----------
tell us a little bit about like what


---------08:19----------
your upbringing was like and


---------08:21----------
yeah um yeah i'd be very glad um


---------08:25----------
yeah so it was really um i was born in


---------08:28----------
1953


---------08:30----------
and i was born in in chicago um


---------08:34----------
you know i feel like the sort of


---------08:37----------
classic american story in that


---------08:41----------
grandparents on one side great


---------08:43----------
grandparents on the other side were


---------08:44----------
immigrants


---------08:46----------
they came fleeing anti-semitism and


---------08:49----------
violence against jews in russia and


---------08:51----------
poland to the united states


---------08:54----------
and then after a couple generations they


---------08:55----------
were successful


---------08:57----------
um my great grandfather was the classic


---------09:01----------
rags to riches in the sense that he was


---------09:03----------
actually a rag salesman


---------09:06----------
collected rags and um there was a family


---------09:09----------
story about one time in the winter in


---------09:11----------
chicago he's on his horse collecting


---------09:13----------
rags and there was a little


---------09:15----------
cart behind him and he froze to the


---------09:17----------
saddle


---------09:18----------
and my great-grandmother had come out


---------09:20----------
with hot water and


---------09:22----------
pour it there so that he could unfreeze


---------09:23----------
from the saddle


---------09:25----------
um and eventually build a paper company


---------09:27----------
um


---------09:28----------
so i was um


---------09:31----------
and then after in his 60s he sold the


---------09:33----------
paper company my great grandfather moved


---------09:35----------
to palestine


---------09:37----------
and built a house there in 1924 that is


---------09:40----------
now a historical site


---------09:42----------
on rothschild boulevard and it's kind of


---------09:44----------
an iconic image of


---------09:46----------
israel and tel aviv because the house


---------09:48----------
has been preserved but


---------09:49----------
in the backyard is a skyscraper and


---------09:53----------
right across the street is another


---------09:54----------
skyscraper so it's in the middle of this


---------09:56----------
you know very commercial district but it


---------09:58----------
was


---------10:00----------
when the house was built just um less


---------10:02----------
than a hundred years ago


---------10:03----------
it was just sand around it it was yeah


---------10:05----------
um so


---------10:07----------
the the all that is to say is that i've


---------10:09----------
been raised on stories of the holocaust


---------10:11----------
and you know the foundation of the state


---------10:13----------
of israel the


---------10:14----------
sort of the response to the the


---------10:16----------
holocaust


---------10:18----------
and my father was a doctor um so i you


---------10:21----------
know my family was well off


---------10:22----------
and so i just was given i'd say the


---------10:26----------
the gift of security in order to


---------10:30----------
look at more deeper risks


---------10:35----------
what do i mean by that what i mean is


---------10:37----------
that um


---------10:38----------
you know prejudice genocide um


---------10:42----------
you know those those you could you could


---------10:43----------
be financially secure as a lot of people


---------10:45----------
were in germany


---------10:47----------
you know before hitler and then you


---------10:50----------
still end up dying


---------10:51----------
um you know so that the deeper threat is


---------10:54----------
this kind of


---------10:54----------
um


---------10:58----------
problem of the human spirit you could


---------11:00----------
say humanity as a whole


---------11:02----------
is um a lot of people are um willing to


---------11:05----------
dehumanize others to be racist


---------11:08----------
to um think of us as separate from


---------11:11----------
nature and trash nature


---------11:13----------
so rick this is a deeply interesting and


---------11:16----------
philosophical kind of take


---------11:18----------
i'm kind of curious what was your act


---------11:21----------
like i mean were you thinking this way


---------11:22----------
when you were like 12


---------11:25----------
i was yeah see my father's hero was saul


---------11:28----------
lewinsky


---------11:30----------
and so saul alinsky wrote the book rules


---------11:32----------
for radicals he's a community organizer


---------11:34----------
in chicago obama studied with saul


---------11:36----------
linsky you know his approaches um


---------11:39----------
so my my family was very um progressive


---------11:42----------
you could say so you grew up in chicago


---------11:45----------
yeah i grew up in chicago i grew up in a


---------11:47----------
place called


---------11:47----------
uh well first off in skokie


---------11:51----------
and sometimes people know of skokie


---------11:54----------
because


---------11:55----------
it's heavily jewish a lot of survivors


---------11:58----------
of the holocaust


---------11:59----------
and at one point in time about i guess


---------12:01----------
it was even 30 or 40 years ago


---------12:04----------
the american nazis wanted to march


---------12:07----------
through skokie and the american civil


---------12:08----------
liberties union defended them


---------12:11----------
and um as a right of free expression and


---------12:14----------
and they lost a lot of support but i i


---------12:16----------
do think they did the whole


---------12:17----------
the right thing but in any case i grew


---------12:19----------
up surrounded by


---------12:20----------
jewish people i was um six years old and


---------12:24----------
my family tells this story i thought the


---------12:26----------
whole world was jewish


---------12:28----------
because that was the whole world that i


---------12:30----------
knew and my parents


---------12:33----------
when they realized that they said no no


---------12:34----------
no we're like a fraction of one percent


---------12:37----------
of the whole world


---------12:38----------
and i got really scared and i'm like


---------12:40----------
well you know what if they're right you


---------12:42----------
know what if


---------12:43----------
you know christ is the messiah we're


---------12:45----------
going to hell you know


---------12:47----------
and they were just like well just you


---------12:49----------
know we don't know about that but we're


---------12:50----------
a tiny tiny minority


---------12:52----------
and so this idea of um


---------12:56----------
sort of yeah security


---------13:00----------
um and the concerns of the world


---------13:04----------
that i was really moved in this


---------13:07----------
direction and so


---------13:08----------
when i was um growing up before i became


---------13:12----------
um


---------13:14----------
12 was the cuban missile crisis and so


---------13:16----------
that was something else that was deeply


---------13:18----------
deeply traumatizing you're a little kid


---------13:20----------
in school you know today


---------13:22----------
sometimes the little kids in school have


---------13:25----------
active shooter drills


---------13:26----------
which is terrifying but this other idea


---------13:30----------
that


---------13:31----------
there could be a nuclear war between the


---------13:34----------
the russia


---------13:35----------
and the united states and we have all


---------13:36----------
these weapons and it could


---------13:38----------
blow up the whole world then you know


---------13:40----------
and then you're saying what


---------13:42----------
how was that traumatizing in what way


---------13:45----------
well you just think of how insane that


---------13:48----------
is


---------13:48----------
you know that um we could be destroying


---------13:52----------
the world you know for these um


---------13:55----------
political conflicts and also that you're


---------13:58----------
told you know duck and cover


---------13:59----------
you know get under your


---------14:03----------
i'm sorry um you know duck under your


---------14:06----------
desk


---------14:06----------
and then you you might survive


---------14:10----------
you know and then you see all these


---------14:11----------
movies of hiroshima and nagasaki and


---------14:14----------
what's going on there what happened


---------14:16----------
there so it just was terrifying that


---------14:18----------
that


---------14:19----------
this was beyond like um genocide


---------14:22----------
of the concentration camps now this was


---------14:24----------
like we could lose the whole world and


---------14:26----------
that this could be pois


---------14:27----------
i remember reading i love to read


---------14:30----------
you know there was a book i read called


---------14:32----------
on the beach which people probably don't


---------14:34----------
know


---------14:35----------
much about today but it was about um


---------14:37----------
people that were on the beach in


---------14:38----------
australia


---------14:39----------
and this was after a nuclear war and


---------14:41----------
they were waiting for the radioactive


---------14:44----------
fallout to you know come to them in the


---------14:46----------
wind


---------14:47----------
so it was like post-apocalypse you know


---------14:51----------
post-nuclear war waiting for them all to


---------14:52----------
die


---------14:53----------
so it just expanded my sense that


---------14:56----------
psychological factors um the way that we


---------15:00----------
can dehumanize others the way that we


---------15:01----------
can make other people the enemies the


---------15:03----------
way we lose our


---------15:04----------
sense of common humanity that that that


---------15:06----------
was a real


---------15:07----------
critical problem and and i i recall


---------15:10----------
einstein saying that our technology has


---------15:14----------
exceeded our humanity


---------15:17----------
so rick yeah yeah i'm i'm noticing so


---------15:20----------
sometimes i'll ask you about kind of


---------15:21----------
your experience of growing up


---------15:24----------
and i i for example i asked you know


---------15:26----------
what was traumatizing about that


---------15:28----------
i noticed that a lot of your answers


---------15:29----------
have to do with the world


---------15:31----------
yeah that like you know the world was a


---------15:33----------
scary place that gender that we had


---------15:35----------
exceeded so i i'm


---------15:36----------
i'm kind of curious about you know use


---------15:38----------
your mind seems to have a focus


---------15:41----------
on the outside


---------15:45----------
that you're sort of thinking about these


---------15:46----------
like broad existential


---------15:49----------
or cultural or societal or worldly


---------15:53----------
problems about like


---------15:54----------
the nature of humanity losing our


---------15:56----------
humanity that our humanity has been


---------15:58----------
exceeded by our technology so i'm kind


---------16:01----------
of so i'm i'm sort of


---------16:03----------
i'm just kind of noticing that we don't


---------16:04----------
seem to be talking about like when i ask


---------16:06----------
you about you


---------16:07----------
you talk about the world ah well


---------16:11----------
my my parents were married for 67 years


---------16:14----------
before my father died


---------16:16----------
um i had a big extended family of


---------16:19----------
grandparents aunts and uncles and


---------16:21----------
cousins


---------16:22----------
so my personal life was


---------16:26----------
really secure and beautiful you know i


---------16:29----------
had loving parents loving grandparents


---------16:32----------
big extended family um


---------16:37----------
i'll share something else about me


---------16:38----------
personally um when i was 12


---------16:40----------
we moved from chicago from skokie to


---------16:43----------
winnetka


---------16:44----------
which is a little bit further north


---------16:46----------
suburb and my parents


---------16:48----------
had a house that was they they had a


---------16:51----------
house designed by a student of frank


---------16:53----------
lloyd wright's


---------16:54----------
and so i grew up in this incredibly


---------16:57----------
beautiful


---------16:57----------
structure that had an enormous impact on


---------17:01----------
me personally and how i thought


---------17:05----------
you know frank lloyd wright sort of


---------17:06----------
blends inside and outside


---------17:08----------
the whole idea that the you know the


---------17:10----------
inside flows to the nature outside um


---------17:12----------
it was a chinese pagoda with a big eight


---------17:15----------
foot by eight foot square skylight at


---------17:17----------
the top it was a one-story house but the


---------17:19----------
roof went up 22 feet so i had


---------17:21----------
it wasn't a box i didn't grow up living


---------17:23----------
in a box i grew up


---------17:25----------
with an indoor atrium where we had a


---------17:27----------
tree that was like


---------17:29----------
15 20 feet high inside the house and i


---------17:32----------
could see from my bed


---------17:33----------
through the skylight uh the moon and the


---------17:37----------
snow


---------17:37----------
and the rain at night and i could see


---------17:39----------
the whole house had stained glass


---------17:40----------
windows


---------17:41----------
uh not saying sliding glass doors i mean


---------17:44----------
sorry it did have some stained glass


---------17:45----------
windows too but it had sliding glass


---------17:46----------
doors


---------17:47----------
uh between as the exterior walls


---------17:51----------
and we had a very private location so


---------17:54----------
you know it just flowed from the inside


---------17:55----------
and out and


---------17:56----------
one of the biggest influences on me as i


---------17:58----------
was growing up was um


---------18:01----------
you know this house the the other part


---------18:03----------
was that i feel now


---------18:04----------
in retrospect that i had absolutely


---------18:07----------
everything that could be done


---------18:09----------
to give me a sense of self-efficacy you


---------18:11----------
could say that i could impact the world


---------18:13----------
so


---------18:14----------
i was born at the time of america height


---------18:16----------
of american power


---------18:17----------
you know before we got uh into vietnam


---------18:20----------
and stuff


---------18:21----------
um i was uh jewish the chosen people


---------18:24----------
before i realized that everybody's the


---------18:26----------
chosen people


---------18:27----------
um i was white um


---------18:30----------
male i was the first born male child


---------18:34----------
and you know my family was well off so i


---------18:37----------
i had


---------18:37----------
um you know probably every advantage


---------18:40----------
that you could


---------18:41----------
have so i guess when i started talking


---------18:43----------
about the world


---------18:44----------
that's where my um my insecurities were


---------18:47----------
not about my own life


---------18:49----------
but were about what the world could


---------18:51----------
impinge


---------18:53----------
on me in different ways and you know


---------18:55----------
when you're young jewish too you're also


---------18:57----------
taught about uh jewish history


---------19:00----------
and there's just this uh constant theme


---------19:03----------
of


---------19:04----------
various people trying to scapegoat and


---------19:05----------
kill the jewish people


---------19:08----------
and you know we were jerusalem world is


---------19:10----------
a dangerous place


---------19:12----------
yeah that that was the kind of thing but


---------19:14----------
i had that message from the utmo


---------19:16----------
sense of security in america after world


---------19:19----------
war ii with


---------19:20----------
you know just where we moved in winnetka


---------19:23----------
i i didn't know this at the time but


---------19:25----------
um they weren't um


---------19:29----------
a lot of people were unwilling to sell


---------19:30----------
the jewish people so there was four


---------19:32----------
houses


---------19:33----------
on a cul-de-sac that my parents got


---------19:36----------
together with three of their jewish


---------19:37----------
friends and they had a christian person


---------19:40----------
buy the land and then once the christian


---------19:43----------
person bought the land then they


---------19:44----------
separated out into these four jewish


---------19:46----------
families


---------19:47----------
wow so the only way we got to live in


---------19:49----------
winnetka was to overcome these


---------19:50----------
prejudices against jews interesting so


---------19:53----------
that was a


---------19:54----------
big part of my upbringing um


---------19:58----------
and so i guess the other thing is that i


---------20:01----------
really got to


---------20:03----------
be very interested in the other you know


---------20:06----------
that


---------20:07----------
and so i studied russian in high school


---------20:10----------
to learn about the russians and because


---------20:12----------
i had


---------20:13----------
my great grandparents came over from


---------20:15----------
russia and my parents were very much


---------20:19----------
open to educating me experiential


---------20:21----------
learning


---------20:22----------
so after my junior year of high school


---------20:25----------
my parents sent me to russia for the


---------20:26----------
summer


---------20:28----------
and to study russian and we went to


---------20:30----------
summer con tashkent there's about 60


---------20:32----------
other


---------20:33----------
high school students from around america


---------20:35----------
we went to london to paris


---------20:36----------
all over moscow but my parents


---------20:39----------
sent me on a mission as well and they


---------20:42----------
gave me in my


---------20:44----------
luggage they gave me a bunch of prayer


---------20:45----------
books to give to the people at the


---------20:48----------
synagogue because prayer books were


---------20:50----------
forbidden


---------20:51----------
at this time in soviet russia which was


---------20:53----------
you know atheist


---------20:55----------
so as a 16 year old boy my parents are


---------20:57----------
saying here's this political mission i


---------20:59----------
want you to do bring these prayer books


---------21:01----------
to the guys at the synagogue


---------21:03----------
wow and because i spoke um


---------21:06----------
russia not very well but well enough to


---------21:08----------
get by


---------21:11----------
on this group of 60 people


---------21:14----------
60 high school students uh me and two


---------21:16----------
other guys


---------21:17----------
were approached by some of uh russian um


---------21:20----------
young people as well but they were like


---------21:22----------
black market people


---------21:23----------
and so this is now 1970 summer of 1970


---------21:27----------
the psychedelic revolution is happening


---------21:29----------
in america didn't happen in russia so


---------21:31----------
the russians wanted to buy anything that


---------21:33----------
smacked of freedom


---------21:34----------
so button shirts even or um books or


---------21:38----------
albums somebody had uh abbey road


---------21:42----------
and you know they bought the record for


---------21:45----------
like two bucks we sold it


---------21:46----------
for a hundred rubles which was more than


---------21:48----------
a hundred dollars worth now rubles at


---------21:50----------
the time were not worth


---------21:52----------
anything outside of russia so they


---------21:53----------
didn't want anybody to be able to escape


---------21:55----------
with money


---------21:56----------
uh but we made thousands and thousands


---------21:59----------
of rubles by selling


---------22:00----------
stuff from all of the people in our trip


---------22:03----------
you know their clothes they're this and


---------22:04----------
that and we took our cut of course


---------22:06----------
and so in the end you know i just had a


---------22:09----------
large amount of russian rubles


---------22:11----------
and i went to the synagogue


---------22:14----------
in moscow to um give these prayer books


---------22:17----------
that my parents had sent me to deliver


---------22:20----------
and i said to this guy hey i got all


---------22:22----------
this money for you got these prayer


---------22:24----------
books and the guy said


---------22:25----------
hey we're being watched uh don't give me


---------22:27----------
anything here but i'll meet you at the


---------22:28----------
subway station


---------22:30----------
underground subway at a certain time at


---------22:32----------
a certain station and bring the money in


---------22:34----------
the books then


---------22:36----------
and i was like okay and i just thought


---------22:38----------
okay you know i'm a 16 year old kid if


---------22:39----------
the russians catch me they'll just send


---------22:41----------
me home you know can we just pause for a


---------22:42----------
second rick


---------22:44----------
can you tell me what on earth it's like


---------22:46----------
to be given a


---------22:47----------
covert political vision at the age of 16


---------22:50----------
like what's going through your head when


---------22:51----------
your parents are like what was your


---------22:52----------
understanding of what you were getting


---------22:54----------
yourself into


---------22:56----------
well my parents were like uh each of us


---------22:59----------
as individuals can make a difference it


---------23:02----------
was very empowering


---------23:04----------
it was like look we we can't stop the


---------23:06----------
prejudice against the jews we can't


---------23:08----------
overturn everything in russia but you


---------23:10----------
yourself can bring a few prayer books


---------23:12----------
and that is something to do so it


---------23:15----------
connected me with my small life


---------23:17----------
and what an individual can do maybe you


---------23:20----------
can't solve the whole uh


---------23:22----------
problem but but you can make a small


---------23:24----------
contribution so


---------23:25----------
that's what i felt like i i thought this


---------23:28----------
is a really wonderful thing that my


---------23:30----------
parents are thinking


---------23:31----------
that in this small way with a few people


---------23:34----------
now maybe getting a prayer book


---------23:36----------
i can make a difference and i think that


---------23:38----------
was that was the main education that i


---------23:40----------
got from them


---------23:40----------
is that you can't just stand idly by you


---------23:43----------
have to


---------23:44----------
get involved and even if it's you know


---------23:47----------
way bigger than any of us


---------23:48----------
each of us individually can make a bit


---------23:50----------
of a difference wow


---------23:52----------
so yeah i i respected them for it and um


---------23:56----------
and and also they were telling me that


---------23:58----------
um they wanted me to take certain risk


---------24:01----------
not only that that they didn't want me


---------24:03----------
to find the safe path


---------24:05----------
um that they wanted me to take certain


---------24:07----------
risks so


---------24:08----------
when i was 18 two years later and after


---------24:10----------
i had been in college


---------24:12----------
hold on we got to find out what happened


---------24:14----------
with the did you meet the dude in the


---------24:15----------
underground station


---------24:17----------
i did i did so what happened


---------24:20----------
well you know we made the transfer and i


---------24:22----------
got away safe


---------24:23----------
and nobody and he got away safely and i


---------24:25----------
gave him all these rubles and he was


---------24:27----------
super happy


---------24:28----------
and um and i just felt like wow


---------24:31----------
you know my first underground activities


---------24:33----------
was against the russians


---------24:34----------
against the communists in russia um


---------24:37----------
and it kind of prepared me for uh


---------24:39----------
addressing the drug war too


---------24:42----------
which was also similar you know unjust


---------24:45----------
in different ways that means i prepared


---------24:47----------
you for the drug war


---------24:49----------
well you know this was illegal what i


---------24:50----------
was doing in russia


---------24:53----------
and so you know once i started wising up


---------24:55----------
to the fact that the drug war was


---------24:58----------
uh criminalizing tools that could be


---------25:00----------
used for


---------25:02----------
personal growth for spirituality that um


---------25:06----------
and if i wanted to use them i would


---------25:07----------
become a criminal myself


---------25:09----------
that that was uh how i was prepared you


---------25:12----------
know that that this


---------25:14----------
first sort of law breaking was against


---------25:15----------
the communists


---------25:17----------
and then this law breaking was against


---------25:19----------
repressive drug war


---------25:21----------
interesting okay so you were saying uh


---------25:23----------
18.


---------25:25----------
yeah so at 18 now i'll also add that as


---------25:29----------
i was growing up my parents


---------25:31----------
um don't drink alcohol they don't


---------25:34----------
they're both dead now but they they


---------25:35----------
didn't smoke cigarettes they they


---------25:37----------
they were very um rational my


---------25:40----------
grandparents


---------25:41----------
my father's parents had a bookstore they


---------25:43----------
were you know poor immigrants had a


---------25:45----------
bookstore they lived above the bookstore


---------25:46----------
that


---------25:47----------
they had only one child but my dad and


---------25:50----------
mother were very


---------25:51----------
um rational and i and i think that


---------25:54----------
part of that was about the fear of what


---------25:56----------
happened in nazi germany that the


---------25:58----------
irrational


---------25:59----------
gets out of control and and we see


---------26:02----------
echoes of that in the united states


---------26:03----------
right now where rationality and truth


---------26:06----------
you know don't matter and it's to a lot


---------26:08----------
of people


---------26:09----------
so it was just this um they were very


---------26:11----------
rational and so we i didn't have a


---------26:13----------
history i'm the oldest of four kids too


---------26:15----------
so there was no drug use going on in my


---------26:18----------
house really my dad


---------26:19----------
who was a doctor realized also that a


---------26:23----------
lot of what he learned


---------26:24----------
in medical school was no longer true so


---------26:26----------
we had a


---------26:27----------
drawer of drugs medicines


---------26:31----------
at our house and whenever we get sick my


---------26:33----------
dad's attitude was don't take a thing


---------26:35----------
you know you're gonna heal on your own


---------26:36----------
it's going to be a little


---------26:38----------
few difficult days the downside of that


---------26:41----------
is when i say oh i don't want to go to


---------26:42----------
school i feel bad you know he's like no


---------26:44----------
you better go to school


---------26:46----------
so but i just believed the propaganda


---------26:51----------
that i was receiving about psychedelics


---------26:54----------
so even though i knew better in other


---------26:56----------
ways i believed


---------26:57----------
that if you took lsd five or six times


---------27:00----------
you were certifiably insane


---------27:02----------
okay that was one of the stories that


---------27:04----------
your sanity is a delicate


---------27:07----------
balance and if you take lsd five or six


---------27:08----------
times you've


---------27:10----------
permanently altered that balance you're


---------27:12----------
certifiably insane


---------27:13----------
i believed the idea that you had


---------27:16----------
chromosome damage


---------27:17----------
and that you would have deformed


---------27:18----------
children from psychedelics that was


---------27:21----------
another big thing you know i believe


---------27:23----------
that


---------27:25----------
that these drugs were something that


---------27:29----------
caused hallucinations delusions there


---------27:32----------
was nothing


---------27:32----------
valid about them whatsoever


---------27:36----------
and it was in my russian class actually


---------27:39----------
in my senior year when i was 17


---------27:42----------
that this uh sort of propaganda i


---------27:45----------
started cracking through the propaganda


---------27:47----------
a friend of mine in the russian class


---------27:48----------
gave me a book to read


---------27:50----------
and i just loved it this was a


---------27:53----------
phenomenal book


---------27:54----------
and when i gave it back to my friend he


---------27:57----------
said


---------27:58----------
do you realize that some of this book


---------28:01----------
was written


---------28:02----------
by the author when he was under the


---------28:03----------
influence of lsd


---------28:05----------
and and i was like that's impossible you


---------28:08----------
know there's nothing good comes from lsd


---------28:10----------
how could you possibly write this great


---------28:11----------
piece of literature


---------28:13----------
it can't be done and and he encouraged


---------28:15----------
me to check into it further which i did


---------28:17----------
and it turned out he was right


---------28:19----------
it was one one flew over the cuckoo's


---------28:21----------
nest by ken keezy


---------28:23----------
and some of it indeed had been written


---------28:24----------
under the influence of lsd


---------28:27----------
so that that sort of made me think


---------28:29----------
here's all this propaganda that i've got


---------28:31----------
it can't


---------28:31----------
can't all be true the other part was


---------28:33----------
that um


---------28:35----------
because i had thought so much about the


---------28:36----------
holocaust about the um


---------28:39----------
you know the human missile crisis and


---------28:41----------
all that now i was being confronted as i


---------28:43----------
was getting closer to


---------28:45----------
18 about vietnam and i was in one of the


---------28:49----------
last years of the lottery and i was


---------28:51----------
you know we had to face the fact what am


---------28:53----------
i going to do about vietnam


---------28:54----------
and at the time


---------28:58----------
and still if if you want to be what's


---------29:00----------
called a conscientious objector


---------29:02----------
and you can get a deferment for a


---------29:04----------
conscientious objector


---------29:06----------
you have to be a pacifist you have to be


---------29:08----------
against all war


---------29:10----------
and i was not against all war i think


---------29:12----------
that there are times when it makes sense


---------29:14----------
to defend oneself


---------29:16----------
so i couldn't be a conscientious


---------29:18----------
objector and this was also at the time


---------29:21----------
uh you know martin luther king was


---------29:22----------
assassinated um


---------29:24----------
a little bit before that and there was


---------29:26----------
just so much that was going on about


---------29:28----------
vietnam


---------29:29----------
um when i was actually


---------29:32----------
um 14


---------29:37----------
i was the precinct captain in my area


---------29:39----------
for eugene mccarthy the peace candidate


---------29:41----------
in 1968


---------29:44----------
and of course he got hardly any votes


---------29:46----------
and so i wanted to be closer to the


---------29:48----------
action so i actually volunteered


---------29:50----------
for mayor daley who was the mayor of


---------29:52----------
chicago and i was a runner


---------29:54----------
for the delegates inside the convention


---------29:57----------
of 1968


---------29:58----------
and so i was um


---------30:02----------
traumatized there at one point where i


---------30:04----------
was downstairs


---------30:06----------
in the sort of um outside of the the


---------30:08----------
where the main convention was taking


---------30:10----------
place and there was a media room and i


---------30:11----------
went in there and there was all these


---------30:13----------
tvs and people were watching tvs and it


---------30:15----------
was tvs of the riots in downtown chicago


---------30:18----------
the police riots against the


---------30:19----------
demonstrators


---------30:20----------
and just this way in which uh the


---------30:24----------
delegates were trying to pretend as if


---------30:25----------
life was normal while there was these


---------30:27----------
massive riots going on outside


---------30:29----------
it just really further radicalized me so


---------30:31----------
i decided to


---------30:32----------
um that what i would do in terms of


---------30:35----------
vietnam


---------30:36----------
is that i would not register for the


---------30:39----------
draft


---------30:40----------
that i would not cooperate with the


---------30:43----------
system


---------30:44----------
at all and that i would


---------30:47----------
drain the system of the most energy um


---------30:50----------
by having them come after me and i would


---------30:51----------
go to jail


---------30:52----------
so i talked this over with my parents


---------30:55----------
and they were


---------30:56----------
fine they just said the problem is that


---------30:58----------
if you do that you're going to be a


---------30:59----------
felon and you're never going to be able


---------31:00----------
to be a doctor or lawyer or whatever is


---------31:02----------
going to require a license


---------31:05----------
but they were not sympathetic with the


---------31:06----------
war in vietnam and


---------31:08----------
and so i you know what uh martin luther


---------31:10----------
king had said


---------31:12----------
that um he said for those who


---------31:15----------
think a law is unjust and are willing to


---------31:18----------
break the law


---------31:18----------
and suffer the consequences as


---------31:22----------
a way to send a message to everybody


---------31:23----------
else about the unjust nature of the law


---------31:26----------
that they actually have the highest


---------31:28----------
respect for the law


---------31:30----------
so that this kind of civil disobedience


---------31:32----------
it's it's you're you're really trying to


---------31:34----------
make the


---------31:34----------
system of laws better by showing the


---------31:37----------
injustice


---------31:38----------
yeah so i i thought that since i was


---------31:40----------
paying taxes i had a social security


---------31:42----------
number i was in


---------31:43----------
high school you know that i would be


---------31:45----------
caught


---------31:46----------
but as it turned out it was just this


---------31:49----------
amazing loophole


---------31:51----------
that i didn't register for the draft and


---------31:54----------
around


---------31:55----------
60 000 other people never registered for


---------31:57----------
the draft and nothing


---------31:58----------
happened to us at all enough people were


---------32:02----------
volunteering for the war


---------32:04----------
that um they had enough recruits


---------32:08----------
and somehow or other from


---------32:11----------
anticipating going to jail to then


---------32:13----------
realizing nothing's going to happen


---------32:15----------
so at a very early stage when i was 18


---------32:19----------
thinking that i was going to be caught


---------32:21----------
any day but i was in college and i


---------32:23----------
started doing lsd


---------32:26----------
and psilocybin and uh mescaline and


---------32:29----------
i started getting this intimations of


---------32:32----------
um this deeper unity you know beyond


---------32:35----------
ego identification i had a difficult


---------32:37----------
time with my drug trips because i was


---------32:40----------
um insecure and


---------32:45----------
you know not very emotionally adept and


---------32:48----------
so it was very hard to let go


---------32:49----------
it was very i got scared a lot but i


---------32:51----------
felt that this was very important it was


---------32:53----------
also


---------32:54----------
um 1971 1972. so the the backlash


---------32:57----------
against the 60s


---------32:59----------
really took place in 1970 with the


---------33:01----------
controlled substances act and nixon


---------33:03----------
criminalizing all these drugs saying


---------33:04----------
timothy leary was the most dangerous man


---------33:06----------
in america


---------33:07----------
um and so it was after the backlash that


---------33:11----------
that i started


---------33:12----------
uh doing these psychedelics and i


---------33:13----------
started sensing something which was


---------33:16----------
this why did you start well


---------33:19----------
because of that book because of um one


---------33:22----------
flew over the cuckoo's nest


---------33:23----------
you know i just thought this is


---------33:26----------
brilliant


---------33:27----------
and if if lsd had something to do with


---------33:30----------
this


---------33:31----------
then it's something that i should


---------33:33----------
explore


---------33:35----------
you know that it it's not just a


---------33:36----------
hallucination it's also that i was very


---------33:40----------
interested in psychological


---------33:41----------
factors and this repression how people


---------33:44----------
can be irrational


---------33:45----------
i had i had a great class in high school


---------33:48----------
on young


---------33:48----------
it was um so my senior year of high


---------33:50----------
school i had a jungian psychology class


---------33:53----------
and the only thing we did for the entire


---------33:55----------
semester was read moby dick


---------33:58----------
from a jungian perspective and so again


---------34:01----------
i started getting more and more


---------34:02----------
interested in psychology


---------34:04----------
and that's around the time i started um


---------34:06----------
looking to psychedelics


---------34:08----------
and it was really a political


---------34:12----------
understanding


---------34:13----------
that inspired me the most that if you


---------34:16----------
can


---------34:17----------
identify as part of everything


---------34:20----------
um you know and that that's your core


---------34:23----------
identity and that your other identities


---------34:25----------
of your race or your


---------34:27----------
gender your nationality or your religion


---------34:29----------
those are


---------34:30----------
secondary built on top of this common


---------34:34----------
humanity which is also linked intimately


---------34:37----------
connected with nature


---------34:39----------
that that's the antidote to genocide or


---------34:41----------
the antidote to this irrational


---------34:43----------
dehumanizing and otherizing others so


---------34:47----------
and when i looked at what happened with


---------34:48----------
the 60s and with all the psychedelics


---------34:50----------
and how that motivated a lot of people


---------34:52----------
to get involved with the anti-war


---------34:53----------
movement


---------34:55----------
and also with the environmental movement


---------34:57----------
the women's rights movement civil rights


---------34:59----------
movement


---------35:00----------
that it just felt like in a crazy world


---------35:02----------
where


---------35:03----------
it could we could blow up the whole


---------35:04----------
world with nuclear weapons or there


---------35:06----------
could be another hitler or that their


---------35:08----------
my own country was now doing these


---------35:10----------
things that


---------35:11----------
really seemed um counterproductive and


---------35:14----------
deadly and dangerous


---------35:16----------
and and not helpful um it's


---------35:19----------
it's just felt like here was a ray of


---------35:20----------
hope psychedelics and the psychedelic


---------35:22----------
consciousness


---------35:24----------
can not only do this connection to


---------35:27----------
spirituality but can also be used


---------35:32----------
to help help us with our own individual


---------35:34----------
issues and the fact that they were


---------35:36----------
criminalized


---------35:37----------
and wiped out the research wiped out all


---------35:40----------
over the world


---------35:41----------
and because i at the time i still


---------35:43----------
thought i was going to go to jail any


---------35:44----------
day and i couldn't have a normal career


---------35:46----------
i thought ha


---------35:46----------
it all comes together i can potentially


---------35:49----------
be a psychedelic therapist i could be an


---------35:50----------
underground psychedelic therapist


---------35:53----------
i don't need a license for that and i


---------35:55----------
need psychedelic therapy myself


---------35:58----------
and and i'll just say one other thing


---------36:00----------
what crystallized it for me was that


---------36:04----------
um i i had a lot of difficult times with


---------36:06----------
my trips


---------36:07----------
um and so i went to the guidance


---------36:08----------
counselor at college


---------36:14----------
what did i mean by difficult yeah yeah


---------36:17----------
um well to give you one of the worst


---------36:20----------
examples um resistance i was scared


---------36:22----------
to so you know psychedelics are moving


---------36:25----------
in you they're


---------36:26----------
opening you up your your logical train


---------36:29----------
of thought is


---------36:30----------
uh inhibited and and you're getting


---------36:33----------
feelings and emotions and different kind


---------36:34----------
of


---------36:35----------
visual images when your eyes are closed


---------36:37----------
sometimes when your eyes are open


---------36:39----------
and the sense of uh being safe enough to


---------36:41----------
surrender control and i didn't feel safe


---------36:43----------
enough to do that so


---------36:45----------
one time when i was um yeah at the time


---------36:48----------
also to


---------36:49----------
put this in context the standard dose of


---------36:51----------
lsd was 250 micrograms which was


---------36:54----------
a major existential dose right now a lot


---------36:57----------
of the


---------36:58----------
lsd tabs blotter tabs are like 60 or 80


---------37:01----------
micrograms


---------37:02----------
so this is three or four hits at one


---------37:04----------
time and that's


---------37:05----------
was just standard what people took you'd


---------37:07----------
be going through a period of a couple


---------37:09----------
hours where you have a hard time to talk


---------37:12----------
for those people that love music one of


---------37:14----------
my absolute favorite albums was


---------37:16----------
by david crosby came out during the 60s


---------37:19----------
with people from


---------37:20----------
all the other groups from san francisco


---------37:22----------
but the title of the album was


---------37:24----------
if i could only remember my name


---------37:28----------
so it's a classic psychedelic album it's


---------37:30----------
terrific if i could only remember my


---------37:32----------
name


---------37:32----------
by david crosby so that's what some of


---------37:35----------
these experiences


---------37:36----------
were like and so i i felt like i was


---------37:38----------
scared i couldn't let go


---------37:40----------
and i had the image of my brain


---------37:44----------
um heating up like a light bulb you know


---------37:47----------
there's like


---------37:47----------
a current that and if you resist the


---------37:50----------
current


---------37:51----------
you know it lights up and so i felt like


---------37:54----------
my resistance to all this mental energy


---------37:57----------
was such


---------37:58----------
that my brain was actually melting and i


---------38:02----------
had this


---------38:02----------
uh nasal drip at the time and i started


---------38:04----------
like


---------38:06----------
thinking oh my god that's my brain


---------38:07----------
coming out of my nose


---------38:09----------
wow and i would hear my brain sloshing


---------38:11----------
around and


---------38:12----------
and you know i exaggerated obviously


---------38:16----------
my brain did not melt but that was the


---------38:18----------
feeling of


---------38:19----------
you know one of the worst trips i ever


---------38:21----------
had that i was


---------38:23----------
and then what made it even harder is


---------38:25----------
that it was my fault


---------38:26----------
you know that i was bad that i was


---------38:28----------
resisting that it wasn't from the lsd


---------38:32----------
llc doesn't normally do that it was my


---------38:35----------
own weaknesses that was causing this


---------38:38----------
terrible situation to happen but i felt


---------38:41----------
that i needed to do it i felt like the


---------38:43----------
60s idealism had crashed and burned that


---------38:45----------
we needed to do this inner work to


---------38:47----------
figure out how do we make a better world


---------38:49----------
and so i i kept doing lsd and the


---------38:52----------
experiences kept


---------38:53----------
being more difficult still with


---------38:55----------
intimations of some beautiful moments


---------38:58----------
and that's where i went to the guidance


---------38:59----------
counselor at college at new college of


---------39:01----------
florida


---------39:02----------
in sarasota florida and i said help me


---------39:04----------
with my trip and


---------39:06----------
you know it was a different era then and


---------39:08----------
he took me seriously


---------39:09----------
and he said this is important what


---------39:11----------
you're doing and it's


---------39:12----------
just as important as your classwork uh


---------39:15----------
maybe even more important


---------39:17----------
that you really need to be seeing a


---------39:20----------
you know you're your own instrument you


---------39:21----------
are your own instrument and


---------39:24----------
you need to work on your own clarity as


---------39:26----------
well so that


---------39:27----------
you know we see the world through our


---------39:28----------
own blinders the whole scientific method


---------39:30----------
is about


---------39:31----------
getting past our own biases the beauty


---------39:34----------
of the scientific method is


---------39:36----------
uh methodologies to try to make it so


---------39:38----------
that we can see


---------39:39----------
more closely to what's really there


---------39:41----------
compared to what we want to see


---------39:44----------
so this guidance counselor gave me a


---------39:47----------
book to read


---------39:48----------
and this is what sort of sealed my


---------39:50----------
future rare guidance counselor


---------39:53----------
it was so lucky well beyond lucky


---------39:56----------
um the book was realms of the human


---------39:59----------
unconscious


---------40:00----------
observations from lsd research by stan


---------40:03----------
groff


---------40:04----------
this was 1972. this is stan's first


---------40:07----------
book it wasn't published till 1975.


---------40:12----------
so the guidance counselor had a


---------40:14----------
manuscript copy directly from stan


---------40:18----------
and reading that book is what


---------40:21----------
put it all together for me and i would


---------40:24----------
still recommend that book realms of the


---------40:25----------
human unconscious


---------40:27----------
to people who are looking to understand


---------40:28----------
more about lsd psychotherapy


---------40:31----------
but what stan was talking about was


---------40:36----------
sort of three basic areas you could say


---------40:38----------
you know your


---------40:39----------
psychodynamics based on stuff that


---------40:41----------
happened when you were


---------40:42----------
alive then this um birth trauma


---------40:46----------
this idea of you know going from this


---------40:49----------
floating in your mother's womb to going


---------40:51----------
through this traumatic situation of


---------40:53----------
birth that that kind of


---------40:54----------
imprints things in in consciousness and


---------40:57----------
then beyond that would be the union


---------40:59----------
era that he spoke about which was sort


---------41:01----------
of archetype spirituality mysticism


---------41:04----------
things that went beyond our own


---------41:07----------
individual life but sort of


---------41:08----------
about all humans and all that he learned


---------41:11----------
about


---------41:12----------
these realms from lsd and so it had that


---------41:15----------
mystical spiritual thing which i thought


---------41:17----------
was fundamental for political reasons


---------41:19----------
but


---------41:20----------
it also had a scientific overlay


---------41:23----------
because i had already learned to


---------41:25----------
distrust um


---------41:27----------
religious mythologies that


---------41:30----------
you know a lot of them are you know they


---------41:33----------
they make things too concrete


---------41:36----------
they can be beautiful symbolically but


---------41:38----------
when they become concrete then you have


---------41:39----------
to be


---------41:40----------
a little bit more suspicious of them and


---------41:42----------
then particularly when people say this


---------41:44----------
is the only one right way


---------41:45----------
and all that but so this was science


---------41:48----------
looking at um mysticism and spirituality


---------41:51----------
in a way i felt was trustworthy


---------41:53----------
but the ultimate thing was that it was


---------41:55----------
about psychotherapy


---------41:57----------
so it was about a reality check a


---------41:59----------
practical thing


---------42:00----------
what do all of these mystical what are


---------42:03----------
all of these


---------42:05----------
experiences that you can have what do


---------42:07----------
they actually do to help people


---------42:09----------
enjoy their lives more to have a deeper


---------42:11----------
richer sense of meaning and purpose


---------42:14----------
and that that was something because i


---------42:16----------
think you can get lost in spirituality


---------42:18----------
and lost in mysticism and and


---------42:20----------
where do you bring it back down to earth


---------42:22----------
and to try to practically


---------42:23----------
that's so practically so i thought this


---------42:26----------
was something reliable so i wrote a


---------42:28----------
letter


---------42:29----------
to stan groff now i'm just a confused


---------42:32----------
18 year old you know doing lsd and


---------42:35----------
stands in his


---------42:36----------
40s and is


---------42:40----------
you know premier md phd at johns hopkins


---------42:43----------
doing lsd research that was just


---------42:45----------
being shut down and he wrote me back


---------42:49----------
that was the amazing thing and he


---------42:51----------
encouraged me and he said he was doing a


---------42:52----------
workshop that summer


---------42:54----------
out in california with joan halifax who


---------42:57----------
he had just been married to


---------42:59----------
um and he invited me to attend


---------43:02----------
which i did so i hitchhiked across


---------43:04----------
america in


---------43:05----------
summer of 72 back when people were


---------43:07----------
hitchhiking


---------43:08----------
some people have heard about the rainbow


---------43:10----------
festival which is a big gathering


---------43:12----------
it's kind of a hippie native american


---------43:14----------
gathering and and i saw


---------43:16----------
signs about it the very first one as i


---------43:19----------
was hitchhiking across america and so i


---------43:20----------
ended up going to the first rainbow


---------43:22----------
festival


---------43:23----------
in granby colorado i ended up


---------43:27----------
you know making my way across the


---------43:29----------
country and i took this workshop with


---------43:31----------
stan


---------43:31----------
i did a month-long encounter group


---------43:34----------
in the mountains of california again


---------43:38----------
trying to work on myself as an


---------43:39----------
instrument i heard about primal therapy


---------43:42----------
which was sort of the primal scream


---------43:45----------
about this


---------43:46----------
birth trauma and so i did a three-week


---------43:47----------
primal intensive


---------43:49----------
and in the end of all of it i wasn't


---------43:52----------
where i wanted to be i i wasn't


---------43:54----------
evolved as much as i hoped i still had


---------43:57----------
all sorts of problems


---------43:59----------
um worries concerns and i i


---------44:02----------
i dropped out of college you know i told


---------44:04----------
my parents that


---------44:05----------
school no longer mattered to me that


---------44:08----------
this inner work mattered and i wanted to


---------44:09----------
study lsd


---------44:10----------
and i wanted to drop out of college and


---------44:12----------
i wanted them to pay for me to study lsd


---------44:15----------
and to give you a sense of how my


---------44:18----------
parents were


---------44:20----------
it took them a while but they eventually


---------44:22----------
decided yes they would help me


---------44:24----------
and my what my dad said was that he


---------44:26----------
thought i was a stubborn guy


---------44:29----------
and that um if he didn't help me


---------44:33----------
i would still try to do that and it


---------44:35----------
would take me a longer amount of time to


---------44:37----------
realize


---------44:37----------
it was a mistake and if he helped me


---------44:41----------
i would realize it was a mistake sooner


---------44:44----------
and he said


---------44:45----------
he had a shred of doubt maybe i needed i


---------44:49----------
knew what i needed to do


---------44:51----------
so he also validated that so my parents


---------44:53----------
were willing to


---------44:55----------
uh help me from age 18 drop out of


---------44:57----------
college and study lsd and so


---------44:59----------
after i did all these things i went home


---------45:01----------
and lived with uh my siblings who were


---------45:04----------
going to school but i just sat around


---------45:06----------
for a couple months and


---------45:07----------
that's where i realized that i had um


---------45:10----------
underestimated the importance of


---------45:12----------
integration


---------45:13----------
and i think to sort of weave this back


---------45:15----------
to some of your earlier


---------45:17----------
comments about people who said that they


---------45:18----------
had ptsd or


---------45:21----------
depression or so after their lsd or


---------45:22----------
psilocybin experiences


---------45:24----------
that you really need to spend time


---------45:26----------
integrating it that that's the way that


---------45:28----------
you can process these things that


---------45:30----------
it's not just about the experience at


---------45:32----------
all in fact that's a big


---------45:33----------
part of it but it's even more about what


---------45:36----------
you learn from it what you bring back


---------45:38----------
how you integrate it and i had had a


---------45:41----------
delusion


---------45:42----------
that the more drugs you take the faster


---------45:45----------
you take them


---------45:46----------
the more you'll evolve and i just really


---------45:49----------
didn't understand that


---------45:51----------
you could end up digging yourself deeper


---------45:52----------
into all that way you really need to


---------45:54----------
integrate what you've learned and that's


---------45:57----------
what we've


---------45:58----------
you know totally put into practice in


---------45:59----------
terms of our mdma assisted psychotherapy


---------46:02----------
lots of emphasis on preparation and


---------46:04----------
integration


---------46:06----------
the experiences are embedded in a larger


---------46:09----------
psychedelic


---------46:10----------
uh psychotherapy process


---------46:13----------
most of the sessions without drugs at


---------46:15----------
all so


---------46:16----------
i just really didn't understand that and


---------46:20----------
finally i realized that i was so lost in


---------46:22----------
my head about these


---------46:23----------
spirituality philosophical worldly


---------46:25----------
things


---------46:26----------
that i i felt like i needed to get


---------46:28----------
grounded and so that's where i got back


---------46:30----------
uh


---------46:31----------
i thought i need to build things get in


---------46:32----------
the physical world


---------46:34----------
which which basically led to 10 years


---------46:36----------
for me


---------46:37----------
of building houses building handball


---------46:39----------
courts of just building things


---------46:41----------
to help me integrate my psychedelic


---------46:43----------
experiences and it wasn't till i was 28


---------46:45----------
that i was able to go back to college as


---------46:47----------
a freshman to


---------46:49----------
formally study to be a psychedelic


---------46:51----------
therapist


---------46:52----------
wow interesting yeah so that's that's


---------46:56----------
very rare you know it's interesting rick


---------46:57----------
because i i think um


---------47:00----------
in a sense i think our story has i have


---------47:02----------
some interesting parallels with my life


---------47:04----------
to what


---------47:04----------
you describe and i think this is part of


---------47:06----------
the message that i think


---------47:08----------
our community needs to hear so you know


---------47:10----------
i finished college at the age of 23


---------47:12----------
after failing a bunch of classes


---------47:14----------
and then basically had my parents sort


---------47:17----------
of support me with the goal of becoming


---------47:19----------
a monk


---------47:20----------
um really yeah yeah and and


---------47:24----------
so i was lucky enough because you know i


---------47:26----------
i didn't have to worry about


---------47:27----------
how i was gonna pay for a ticket to


---------47:29----------
india and


---------47:31----------
and i would you know fly to india and


---------47:32----------
i'd stay at ashrams or monasteries and


---------47:35----------
and study different kinds of meditations


---------47:37----------
and


---------47:38----------
i think a little bit more on the


---------47:39----------
esoteric mystical or spiritual side


---------47:42----------
where i also had


---------47:43----------
experiences that were you know


---------47:46----------
far beyond mindfulness um


---------47:50----------
and then i sort of start i started med


---------47:52----------
school at the age of 27


---------47:54----------
and then it took me about four years to


---------47:56----------
sort of get into med school and i think


---------47:58----------
a big thing that


---------48:00----------
we hear a lot from from this community


---------48:02----------
is that like people feel like they're


---------48:03----------
behind


---------48:04----------
you know they're like 23 they're 24


---------48:06----------
maybe they dropped out of college


---------48:08----------
maybe they you know finished college and


---------48:11----------
weren't able to get a job and


---------48:12----------
and i've been trying to explain to them


---------48:15----------
and i think your story is


---------48:16----------
a wonderful example of of in my mind


---------48:19----------
karma


---------48:20----------
karma yeah that it's such an interesting


---------48:23----------
confluence of events you know it's like


---------48:26----------
it's so interesting how your


---------48:28----------
your your life what i'm hearing is like


---------48:30----------
a lot of threads that kind of get woven


---------48:32----------
together you went to some you grew up in


---------48:34----------
in outside of chicago went to a school


---------48:38----------
in florida it sounds like yeah right so


---------48:41----------
like like you wind up at a school


---------48:43----------
and you wind up with a guidance


---------48:45----------
counselor i for the life of me cannot


---------48:47----------
imagine a single guidance counselor i


---------48:50----------
have ever met or ever heard of


---------48:52----------
when someone when an 18 year old comes


---------48:54----------
into your office and says hey i'm having


---------48:56----------
like bad trips


---------48:58----------
they send you straight to like


---------49:00----------
university health services


---------49:02----------
for addictions no one says hey i have a


---------49:05----------
pre-manuscript copy


---------49:07----------
from stan groff who's sort of the


---------49:09----------
eminent researcher on lsd


---------49:12----------
and this is a book that's not going to


---------49:13----------
be published for years take it and read


---------49:15----------
it


---------49:16----------
like the the the statistical


---------49:20----------
unlikeliness of that confluence of


---------49:22----------
events


---------49:24----------
is just such an outlier


---------49:27----------
well i'll say one yes very much so but


---------49:30----------
the college that i chose was an


---------49:32----------
experimental college


---------49:34----------
that had started in the 60s and it had


---------49:37----------
been


---------49:38----------
created by people who really wanted to


---------49:41----------
do an alternative to


---------49:42----------
traditional education interesting and so


---------49:45----------
what they said was that the


---------49:46----------
students curiosity is the most important


---------49:49----------
thing


---------49:50----------
and therefore nothing should stand in


---------49:52----------
the way of the students curiosity


---------49:54----------
so they designed a school where


---------49:57----------
there was no grades it was all written


---------50:01----------
evaluations


---------50:03----------
heavy emphasis on independent study


---------50:06----------
with with professors you could create


---------50:08----------
your own classes you get a few of your


---------50:10----------
friends you say we want to study this


---------50:11----------
and


---------50:12----------
you come up with a reading list or so


---------50:13----------
you talk to a professor you can get


---------50:15----------
credit for that


---------50:16----------
you had to do a contract for a semester


---------50:20----------
and you passed or failed the whole


---------50:21----------
semester and you negotiate what's in the


---------50:23----------
contract


---------50:24----------
it can be some classes some independent


---------50:26----------
study some risk everybody had to do a


---------50:28----------
senior thesis


---------50:28----------
as well now the honors college of the


---------50:31----------
state of florida


---------50:32----------
but the other thing that they did not


---------50:34----------
that i did not know


---------50:35----------
when i um applied there um i


---------50:38----------
i just was getting tired of being boxed


---------50:40----------
in the


---------50:41----------
requirements this and that so the


---------50:43----------
freedom to explore my curiosity was


---------50:45----------
really attracted to me to that school um


---------50:48----------
they sent out stuff to people that did


---------50:50----------
well on the national merit scores and um


---------50:52----------
and so i just got something in the mail


---------50:53----------
from i've never heard about that but


---------50:55----------
the the two things that they did not put


---------50:57----------
in the brochure


---------51:00----------
that i didn't notice when i visited the


---------51:01----------
campus with my father


---------51:03----------
um until i got there was that they had a


---------51:06----------
tradition of all night dance parties


---------51:08----------
with psychedelics until the sun rise


---------51:11----------
the school the building was designed by


---------51:13----------
i am pay


---------51:14----------
the famous architect and it had a


---------51:16----------
courtyard palm court in the middle of


---------51:18----------
the dorms


---------51:19----------
that imp had designed where the


---------51:21----------
classrooms were off that he'd also


---------51:22----------
designed somewhere else


---------51:23----------
and so we would have these uh all night


---------51:25----------
parties with psychedelics


---------51:28----------
um and then in the morning um it would


---------51:31----------
go till sunrise


---------51:32----------
kind of like prefiguring raves and


---------51:34----------
things like that and um


---------51:36----------
but there was also this sense of the


---------51:37----------
individual doing their own psychedelic


---------51:40----------
experiences you know that that was


---------51:41----------
valued so


---------51:42----------
it was both therapeutic spiritual and uh


---------51:46----------
communal recreational celebratory


---------51:48----------
with psychedelics so that was that's how


---------51:50----------
dude


---------51:51----------
yeah well it gets even more so um the


---------51:54----------
swimming pool


---------51:55----------
um it didn't have a lot of facilities it


---------51:58----------
kind of was a


---------51:59----------
a school for the imagination because


---------52:01----------
john ringling the ringling brothers


---------52:03----------
circus


---------52:05----------
had was wintering in sarasota that was


---------52:07----------
their long


---------52:09----------
their history there and so the john


---------52:11----------
ringling's house


---------52:13----------
which is this massive beautiful big


---------52:15----------
party house now a state


---------52:17----------
of florida museum was um right next to


---------52:20----------
the campus and his brother's house


---------52:22----------
charles ringling's house that was


---------52:23----------
donated to the campus to create the


---------52:25----------
school so


---------52:26----------
we we had this like party theme carnival


---------52:29----------
theme circus theme


---------52:31----------
but also there was a woman who actually


---------52:33----------
had studied with jung marion hopping was


---------52:36----------
her name and she taught jungian


---------52:37----------
psychology


---------52:38----------
and her husband was um quite wealthy


---------52:42----------
and they donated this olympic size


---------52:44----------
swimming pool with a big deck around


---------52:46----------
it big fences all around it and somehow


---------52:48----------
or other it evolved into a nudist colony


---------52:52----------
so i was a super shy guy in high school


---------52:55----------
could barely talk to girls


---------52:57----------
and now here i am at in this nudist


---------53:00----------
colony with with all these


---------53:01----------
um you know naked men and women


---------53:05----------
and it just felt like the underground


---------53:08----------
energies of sex and drugs


---------53:10----------
were sort of brought to the surface


---------53:13----------
where we could


---------53:14----------
try to deal with them it felt like an


---------53:16----------
oasis of sanity in a crazy world


---------53:19----------
and so it's not that unusual that there


---------53:21----------
would be a guidance counselor there that


---------53:23----------
would know about


---------53:24----------
lsd research what i think is wild is


---------53:26----------
that you describe the nudist colony with


---------53:29----------
all night psychedelic parties


---------53:30----------
as the oasis of sanity in a crazy world


---------53:35----------
yeah well it just felt that way that so


---------53:37----------
much is repressed


---------53:39----------
that and when you repress stuff it comes


---------53:41----------
out warped and distorted


---------53:44----------
and when you bring that to the surface


---------53:46----------
you can work with it you can see


---------53:48----------
it's just um yeah it did feel like this


---------53:51----------
oasis of sanity that


---------53:53----------
that we and the campus police their


---------53:56----------
job was to protect us from the real


---------53:58----------
police


---------54:00----------
from the city police and so


---------54:04----------
just to give you an example again um


---------54:07----------
they had two lists of where people were


---------54:11----------
when when parents would call or people


---------54:12----------
would come and say you know where


---------54:14----------
where's


---------54:14----------
this uh where's my son or daughter you


---------54:17----------
know what room are they in


---------54:18----------
so they had the list at the police the


---------54:21----------
cop shop we called it they had the list


---------54:23----------
of wherever


---------54:24----------
the rooms were that people were assigned


---------54:25----------
to live in


---------54:27----------
but then they had another list of where


---------54:28----------
people were actually living


---------54:30----------
you know you could move in with your


---------54:31----------
girlfriend or you could do all these


---------54:33----------
different kind of things


---------54:34----------
on campus uh it was just astonishing so


---------54:38----------
it it


---------54:39----------
and and there was this general sense


---------54:41----------
that um


---------54:42----------
you know the young people are leading


---------54:44----------
the revolution we're doing this


---------54:46----------
psychedelic stuff and


---------54:47----------
um you know the older people are you


---------54:49----------
know repressing and so


---------54:51----------
it did feel like an oasis of sanity and


---------54:54----------
and so i just


---------54:55----------
would not be who i am without that


---------54:57----------
particular


---------54:58----------
college experience wow dude that's


---------55:01----------
that's


---------55:02----------
wild man thank you so much for sharing


---------55:04----------
that


---------55:05----------
yeah now i'd also i got a question for


---------55:07----------
you which is uh


---------55:08----------
how did you decide not to become a monk


---------55:10----------
so you you go to meditate you're doing


---------55:12----------
all these things


---------55:13----------
what made you turn away from from that


---------55:16----------
path


---------55:16----------
i so in a sense i didn't turn away so


---------55:18----------
what i real a couple of things one is i


---------55:20----------
met my wife and fell in love and was


---------55:22----------
conflicted for a while


---------55:24----------
um and and so it's funny because i sort


---------55:27----------
of talk about it like i met her at the


---------55:29----------
end i actually so as soon as i tried to


---------55:31----------
become a monk so when i was 21 years old


---------55:33----------
i went to my teachers after one summer


---------55:36----------
so


---------55:37----------
i had a pretty amazing summer where i i


---------55:39----------
started to practice some pretty


---------55:41----------
intensive meditation


---------55:42----------
and and what i loved about it is that i


---------55:44----------
i had some spiritual experiences


---------55:47----------
and so i was always sort of a curious


---------55:49----------
kid was always a skeptical kid but


---------55:51----------
when you have experiences of


---------55:54----------
you know con connectedness or


---------55:58----------
other i mean it's hard to describe but


---------55:59----------
you start to


---------56:01----------
experience sensations and


---------56:05----------
experiences that are different from your


---------56:06----------
day-to-day existence


---------56:09----------
so a good example of this is like


---------56:12----------
sometimes i'll ask people


---------56:13----------
where their thoughts are localized in


---------56:15----------
space


---------56:17----------
and i think if you really pay attention


---------56:19----------
you'll learn


---------56:20----------
that your thoughts are localized


---------56:22----------
actually somewhere around the space of


---------56:23----------
your head


---------56:24----------
but we don't think about our thoughts as


---------56:27----------
being around our head


---------56:29----------
until you haven't like something like an


---------56:31----------
out-of-body experience where your


---------56:33----------
existence is outside of your physical


---------56:38----------
being


---------56:38----------
and then once you step outside of your


---------56:40----------
physical being then you realize oh


---------56:41----------
there's actually like a layer on top so


---------56:43----------
i had these kinds of experiences which


---------56:45----------
were really fascinating and i loved them


---------56:48----------
but really a lot of my deciding to


---------56:50----------
become a monk so i went to my teachers


---------56:52----------
and i said hey i want to take my vows


---------56:53----------
and at the age of 21 i want to become a


---------56:55----------
monk


---------56:55----------
and they said we're we're thrilled that


---------56:58----------
you want to do this fantastic


---------57:00----------
go finish your education go get a


---------57:02----------
doctoral degree


---------57:03----------
and then if you're still interested at


---------57:04----------
the age of 30 we'll take you


---------57:08----------
and and so i think they sort of


---------57:09----------
recognized that i was passionate and


---------57:11----------
that it was sort of


---------57:12----------
a decision that was made from the wrong


---------57:14----------
places and what i realized is that my


---------57:16----------
decision to become a monk was actually


---------57:18----------
out of like ego


---------57:20----------
i'd failed at life i sucked at it i knew


---------57:23----------
i was smart


---------57:24----------
i was the son of two doctors and they


---------57:26----------
had everyone expected so much from me


---------57:28----------
and i expected a lot for myself


---------57:31----------
and so i found myself underperforming


---------57:34----------
compared to people who i was better than


---------57:38----------
and that was really hard for me and so


---------57:40----------
what i realized is that


---------57:42----------
i'm going to devalue everything that i'm


---------57:45----------
bad at


---------57:46----------
and i'm going to become spiritual as


---------57:49----------
opposed to materialistic


---------57:51----------
i'm not going to care about going and


---------57:54----------
becoming a doctor and i'm going to rise


---------57:55----------
above all of that


---------57:56----------
i'm going to be better and all that but


---------57:58----------
really it was like a very deep


---------58:00----------
rooted spiritual ego which i think is


---------58:02----------
very present


---------58:03----------
like in a lot of spirituality there's so


---------58:06----------
much underground ego


---------58:08----------
look at how spiritual i am and and it's


---------58:12----------
really bizarre


---------58:13----------
and so i realized that i don't need to


---------58:15----------
become a monk


---------58:16----------
that actually ultimately becoming a monk


---------58:19----------
is not about wearing a particular thing


---------58:21----------
or living in a particular


---------58:22----------
place it's all about the quality of your


---------58:24----------
internal experience


---------58:26----------
and that being a monk is about attitude


---------58:29----------
it's about paying attention to what's


---------58:31----------
within whether you're doing external


---------58:33----------
things or not it's completely irrelevant


---------58:36----------
and so you know i i think it was strange


---------58:38----------
for a while because i would do things


---------58:40----------
like sleep on the floor and stuff


---------58:41----------
because i didn't care


---------58:43----------
and then my my wife cares about nice


---------58:46----------
things so she would get nice things and


---------58:47----------
i would learn to appreciate those and


---------58:49----------
like


---------58:50----------
also learn that like it doesn't matter


---------58:51----------
whether you sleep in a nice bed


---------58:53----------
or on the floor and like you just like


---------58:55----------
being a monk is entirely internal it's


---------58:57----------
nothing on the outside


---------58:59----------
um and so ultimately that's why i


---------59:01----------
realized that it was


---------59:02----------
it was kind of false and then


---------59:05----------
i i was in love and i was conflicted and


---------59:07----------
then i realized actually that like


---------59:10----------
that was also a division that i didn't i


---------59:12----------
could i could love her and be with her


---------59:14----------
and that


---------59:14----------
that was part of my karma and i could


---------59:16----------
also continue my internal spiritual


---------59:18----------
journey


---------59:19----------
um which is what i've done so that's


---------59:21----------
kind of how i decided


---------59:23----------
wow now i i have a a monk story i'd like


---------59:26----------
to


---------59:27----------
share it seems very appropriate now so


---------59:30----------
this is uh


---------59:31----------
one of the experiences that where i took


---------59:33----------
mdma by myself


---------59:34----------
camping out in nature um this was now


---------59:38----------
in um um 1985.


---------59:43----------
and i had gotten to know a christian


---------59:46----------
monk brother david steinle ross


---------59:48----------
and i i would encourage people to uh


---------59:51----------
check him out


---------59:52----------
he's he's written one book was called


---------59:54----------
the gratitude is the heart of prayer


---------59:56----------
there's something from brother david


---------59:57----------
steinle ross on


---------59:59----------
youtube i think it's like a three-minute


---------60:02----------
meditation about gratitude like today


---------60:04----------
it's a beautiful beautiful thing but he


---------60:07----------
was also


---------60:07----------
ecumenical he was very much


---------60:11----------
even though he was roman catholic he was


---------60:13----------
very mystical he wasn't


---------60:14----------
didn't see that in in only those ways


---------60:16----------
and also i i met him


---------60:18----------
in 1982 um when i went


---------60:21----------
to uh when i first went back to college


---------60:23----------
at age 28 but i started


---------60:24----------
my first semester was at esslin


---------60:26----------
institute in big sur with stan


---------60:28----------
groff on a month-long workshop called


---------60:30----------
the mystical quest


---------60:31----------
he was one of the teachers that's where


---------60:33----------
i also learned about mdma


---------60:35----------
later on in 83 and 84 i had given him


---------60:38----------
mdma he expressed an interest in doing


---------60:41----------
mdma


---------60:42----------
in half doses in the monastery as a tool


---------60:45----------
to aid meditation


---------60:47----------
and he found that it was very helpful


---------60:49----------
and when we


---------60:50----------
sued the dea in 84 to try to keep mdma


---------60:53----------
legal as a medicine there started to be


---------60:56----------
some publicity


---------60:58----------
and in the beginning of 85 newsweek did


---------61:01----------
an


---------61:01----------
article uh the first major media article


---------61:04----------
on mdma and it quoted me but it also


---------61:05----------
quoted brother david and he said that


---------61:07----------
he described his experience doing mdma


---------61:11----------
as a tool for meditation and he said


---------61:13----------
that it


---------61:15----------
produced the same enlightened attitude


---------61:16----------
that uh hmong could spend 30 years


---------61:19----------
trying to meditate to achieve which is


---------61:21----------
an incredible statement


---------61:22----------
the quietness that you can get so i i


---------61:26----------
took mdma one time um


---------61:29----------
shortly after this article came out i


---------61:31----------
was camping out it was just this


---------61:33----------
beautiful


---------61:33----------
beautiful spot um right at the beaches


---------61:37----------
uh at the edge of the pacific the


---------61:39----------
mountains came down right behind me


---------61:41----------
um there was some boulders out in the


---------61:43----------
ocean so that um the high tide came


---------61:45----------
around me but i was protected from the


---------61:47----------
high tide


---------61:48----------
there was a freshwater stream right


---------61:49----------
nearby and


---------61:51----------
it was a safe protected spot that i knew


---------61:53----------
really well


---------61:54----------
and so i decided that i would take mdma


---------61:57----------
there and i was not in a relationship at


---------62:00----------
the time


---------62:01----------
and i was thinking i wonder why would


---------62:03----------
somebody want to be a monk


---------62:04----------
you know what what's the you know and


---------62:06----------
why would somebody want to be celibate


---------62:10----------
and and i also was wondering how do i do


---------62:12----------
what i want to do


---------62:13----------
and not get busted by the dea as well so


---------62:16----------
under the influence of mdma um you know


---------62:19----------
it's not visual like lsd or psilocybin


---------62:21----------
but


---------62:22----------
there was a big tree there and i was


---------62:23----------
sort of projecting images on the tree


---------62:25----------
and the tree was like the dea looking at


---------62:28----------
me


---------62:29----------
um and how do i stay safe and and i came


---------62:32----------
up with this strategy basically which


---------62:33----------
has


---------62:34----------
served me well i think which is that the


---------62:35----------
dea is always looking at what's under


---------62:37----------
the rock


---------62:38----------
you know what's hidden but a lot of


---------62:39----------
times you just come straight at them


---------62:41----------
even if you're criticizing them um


---------62:45----------
ironically that can be safe you know


---------62:47----------
you're just coming right at him


---------62:49----------
so then i started thinking about um


---------62:51----------
brother david


---------62:52----------
and why would somebody want to be


---------62:53----------
celebrate and why would somebody want to


---------62:55----------
be a monk and


---------62:56----------
i was thinking about that for a while


---------62:57----------
and then i just felt like the roaring of


---------62:59----------
the ocean the waves of the ocean


---------63:01----------
the ocean was so enormous and then the


---------63:04----------
sky


---------63:04----------
the milky way and the sky was just


---------63:06----------
incredible


---------63:08----------
and it just felt like i was perched on


---------63:10----------
the edge of the world which i really


---------63:12----------
was in a sense and i started thinking i


---------63:15----------
might just


---------63:16----------
disappear you know what is keeping me


---------63:18----------
here i mean


---------63:19----------
the the universe is so vast um


---------63:22----------
and and i felt like i was dissolving


---------63:24----------
into the universe and and there was that


---------63:26----------
that beautiful aspect of that but then


---------63:29----------
after a while


---------63:30----------
i realized i'm still here you know


---------63:33----------
what's keeping me here and


---------63:36----------
then i started thinking about gravity


---------63:39----------
that somehow or other


---------63:40----------
i had this image of gravity


---------63:44----------
i as the arms of a lover that that i was


---------63:47----------
cradled in the arms of gravity


---------63:50----------
and that that was keeping me together


---------63:53----------
that's what


---------63:54----------
made things adhere instead of just


---------63:56----------
dissipate into everything


---------63:58----------
and i i felt gravity as


---------64:02----------
warm as an embrace as an embrace of a


---------64:04----------
lover


---------64:06----------
and i thought aha this is what the monk


---------64:09----------
and celibacy is about that you're


---------64:11----------
supposed to


---------64:13----------
feel that kind of love for the universe


---------64:16----------
if you focus it on a


---------64:17----------
specific person maybe that makes it


---------64:20----------
harder to


---------64:20----------
to transfer it to the that same kind of


---------64:23----------
warmth to the


---------64:24----------
to the universe and so one once i felt


---------64:28----------
that


---------64:28----------
i after that experience i never have


---------64:31----------
felt as lonely as i have


---------64:33----------
before because i feel like there's this


---------64:35----------
love woven into the universe


---------64:37----------
but then once i realized that i was


---------64:39----------
cradled in the arms of gravity and that


---------64:40----------
this was kind of what the monastic life


---------64:42----------
was in part about i said great


---------64:44----------
now i don't have to be a monk yeah


---------64:47----------
now i can have a real lover as well as


---------64:49----------
the gravity as a lover


---------64:51----------
now 30 years after that i was at a


---------64:54----------
conference


---------64:57----------
and brother david was one of the


---------64:58----------
speakers and


---------65:00----------
he was uh sitting next to me at dinner i


---------65:03----------
purposely went to sit next to him at


---------65:04----------
dinner


---------65:05----------
and we kept in touch over the years but


---------65:07----------
i had never spoken to him about this


---------65:08----------
experience and and i said


---------65:12----------
uh brother david i just want to share


---------65:13----------
with you this experience the most


---------65:15----------
mystical experience really of my whole


---------65:16----------
life


---------65:17----------
and you were connected to it and i'm


---------65:19----------
wondering just what you might


---------65:21----------
think about it and so um i told him the


---------65:24----------
story and i told him about um


---------65:26----------
you know cradled in the arms of gravity


---------65:29----------
and he just was silent for a very short


---------65:32----------
time


---------65:32----------
and he said every day


---------65:36----------
i think about gravity every day


---------65:40----------
i think about gravity every day


---------65:43----------
and he reaffirmed that sense that the


---------65:44----------
gravity and this kind of is a force of


---------65:47----------
love


---------65:47----------
so i i felt that it took 30 years for me


---------65:49----------
to kind of get that affirmation from him


---------65:51----------
that that was


---------65:52----------
the case and and so um i i feel


---------65:56----------
like um that that was one of the pivotal


---------66:00----------
experiences of my life


---------66:02----------
that on the beach yeah thank you so much


---------66:05----------
for sharing rick this has been


---------66:07----------
amazing i think um i know you have to


---------66:09----------
get going in about 15 minutes so


---------66:11----------
i'm kind of curious i think i've got a


---------66:13----------
couple of questions or directions


---------66:16----------
one is uh well one thing i just want to


---------66:19----------
reinforce this point so the first thing


---------66:21----------
is like for people who feel like they're


---------66:22----------
behind i think rick


---------66:23----------
you're a wonderful example of like you


---------66:26----------
know don't


---------66:27----------
compare yourself to someone else's


---------66:29----------
journey


---------66:30----------
and even this last story that you told


---------66:32----------
is like even


---------66:33----------
you know the the ending to this


---------66:36----------
particular experience


---------66:38----------
happens 30 years later yes exactly you


---------66:41----------
know


---------66:41----------
and and so what i'm what i'm really


---------66:43----------
hearing from you and what i want people


---------66:44----------
to really take away is like what i've


---------66:46----------
experienced in my life which is that


---------66:48----------
you're not living anyone else's life


---------66:50----------
you're living your own


---------66:51----------
so don't judge your life by what other


---------66:54----------
people are doing or things like that


---------66:55----------
because


---------66:56----------
it sounds like you started college at


---------66:57----------
the age of 28


---------66:59----------
and then built up this organization


---------67:01----------
where we're now you know i mean maps is


---------67:03----------
really an amazing organization yeah well


---------67:06----------
i i started college at 17 and then


---------67:08----------
dropped out at 18 for 10 years


---------67:10----------
and then went back as a college freshman


---------67:13----------
at age 28.


---------67:14----------
yeah it's crazy um so so i just wanted


---------67:18----------
to kind of


---------67:18----------
wanted to do it any differently i mean


---------67:20----------
it was really the right thing for me and


---------67:21----------
i i think the lesson you're trying to


---------67:24----------
pull out of it is really right yeah is


---------67:26----------
that you're on your own timetable


---------67:28----------
and you don't have to compare with you


---------67:30----------
know what's right for somebody else


---------67:31----------
might not be what's right for you


---------67:33----------
and um you know the the other


---------67:36----------
sort of aspect of this is um and and


---------67:40----------
i'm not quite sure where you were and


---------67:42----------
your wife are with children but


---------67:44----------
um you know my wife and i we've had


---------67:45----------
three children but they've all


---------67:47----------
uh two of them are on their own one of


---------67:49----------
them is still in college


---------67:50----------
um but when you have little kids you


---------67:54----------
end up um you know it just seems like


---------67:56----------
it's going to go on forever


---------67:58----------
looking forward you know it's like it's


---------68:00----------
never going to change you're always


---------68:02----------
going to


---------68:02----------
have your kids at home but when they're


---------68:04----------
gone and you look back


---------68:06----------
it's like a heartbeat where did those uh


---------68:09----------
18 20 years go


---------68:11----------
yeah so what i want to say from that is


---------68:13----------
that to have a 20-year plan or a 30-year


---------68:16----------
plan


---------68:17----------
is not really that long you know before


---------68:21----------
you know it the future will have arrived


---------68:23----------
so also chart your own way don't feel


---------68:26----------
that you're behind others but also you


---------68:28----------
can have a very long-term plan


---------68:30----------
uh and i think a lot of people don't do


---------68:32----------
that and and then you don't plant the


---------68:34----------
seeds


---------68:35----------
that can later blossom all these years


---------68:38----------
later


---------68:38----------
yeah so that's the mistake people make


---------68:40----------
is oh you know i've got to think in more


---------68:42----------
short-term chunks


---------68:43----------
rick you may not understand what i'm


---------68:45----------
about to say but i think it's


---------68:46----------
illustrative so


---------68:47----------
what i'm hearing from you is that you're


---------68:49----------
a late-game carry


---------68:50----------
yeah and and so i don't know exactly how


---------68:54----------
you mean that but


---------68:55----------
the yeah late bloomer is sort of how i


---------68:57----------
see myself yeah


---------68:58----------
yeah right so i i love the way that you


---------69:00----------
kind of think about it i think the


---------69:01----------
problem is that everyone wants to be


---------69:03----------
like early game focused and they don't


---------69:05----------
recognize that you can sow all these


---------69:07----------
seeds and these


---------69:08----------
you know nudist colony all night parties


---------69:11----------
are soda foundation


---------69:13----------
along with you know an incredible work


---------69:15----------
ethic and parents who


---------69:17----------
sort of acknowledge that you're probably


---------69:19----------
wrong but still held enough faith


---------69:21----------
and enough humility to kind of give you


---------69:23----------
a chance and then


---------69:25----------
also that i i sort of see the forces of


---------69:27----------
karma kind of supporting you it's not


---------69:29----------
quite as active as i'm making it sound


---------69:31----------
but well i would say so


---------69:34----------
i'll just share that i had a dream this


---------69:37----------
is what i think is my karma


---------69:39----------
the dream was many people have seen um


---------69:41----------
2001


---------69:42----------
space odyssey the movie by stanley


---------69:44----------
kubrick and near the end of the movie


---------69:46----------
there's the scene where the astronaut is


---------69:48----------
in an all-white room he's on his


---------69:49----------
deathbed


---------69:50----------
this is right before the sort of birth


---------69:52----------
of the star child so in the dream


---------69:54----------
and this is in my middle 20s so this is


---------69:55----------
after i decided to focus my life on


---------69:57----------
psychedelics but


---------69:59----------
um i remember this dream like like it


---------70:01----------
was just last night


---------70:02----------
um so there's a person on a death bed


---------70:06----------
the room is all white and the the fella


---------70:09----------
tells me a story the story is that


---------70:11----------
he was miraculously


---------70:14----------
safe he almost was killed but he was


---------70:16----------
miraculously saved and he knew he was


---------70:18----------
saved for a purpose but he didn't know


---------70:20----------
what the purpose was


---------70:21----------
and then he says to me let me show you


---------70:23----------
how i almost died


---------70:25----------
and it turned out that the scene now all


---------70:27----------
of a sudden we're out of this all-white


---------70:28----------
room we're at the edge of town it's


---------70:30----------
somewhere


---------70:30----------
russia poland something like that


---------70:32----------
there's thousands of jews that are lined


---------70:34----------
up


---------70:34----------
in front of this big mass grave bunch of


---------70:36----------
germans they machine gun them all


---------70:38----------
they're pushed into this mass grave they


---------70:41----------
throw some dirt over it


---------70:43----------
and this guy is wounded but not killed


---------70:46----------
and then it sort of switched a little


---------70:48----------
bit into like a jesus story where he was


---------70:50----------
buried for three days and then he was


---------70:51----------
resurrected sort of so he sort of climbs


---------70:54----------
his


---------70:54----------
and i'm with him in the dirt underground


---------70:56----------
seeing this whole thing and then he kind


---------70:58----------
of comes to


---------70:58----------
and he claws his way up and um he gets


---------71:02----------
end up somehow earlier he knew where the


---------71:04----------
up was and


---------71:06----------
he gets onto the uh the dirt out of


---------71:10----------
that and there's nobody there it was at


---------71:12----------
the edge of town he runs into the woods


---------71:13----------
he works with the partisans


---------71:15----------
uh till the end of the war and then then


---------71:17----------
he said that's how i was almost safe so


---------71:19----------
now we're back in the all-white room


---------71:20----------
he's on his deathbed and he said now


---------71:22----------
i know what my purpose was i know why i


---------71:26----------
was


---------71:27----------
saved from that i know what my purpose


---------71:29----------
is and i'm like oh


---------71:31----------
what did you learn he said my purpose is


---------71:33----------
to tell you to study psychedelics


---------71:36----------
and that that's going to be the sense of


---------71:39----------
mystical connection


---------71:40----------
is going to be the antidote to genocide


---------71:42----------
and in my head i'm thinking


---------71:44----------
oh okay i've already decided that this


---------71:47----------
is a heavy thing


---------71:48----------
you're trying to lay on me you know that


---------71:49----------
that you want to pass this thing on so


---------71:51----------
you can die in peace


---------71:53----------
and in my mind i'm saying okay i already


---------71:55----------
did decide that so


---------71:56----------
um i will accept that i said okay you


---------71:59----------
can lay that on me i will do that


---------72:01----------
and and then he died um and then i walk


---------72:04----------
out of this white room


---------72:05----------
i watched him die i walk out of the


---------72:06----------
right room and all of a sudden i'm in


---------72:08----------
the middle of a forest


---------72:10----------
and then i i i go down there's a little


---------72:12----------
stream and so i'm sitting in front of


---------72:13----------
the stream i dread a lot of hermann


---------72:15----------
hesse and


---------72:16----------
this siddhartha and so i'm like watching


---------72:18----------
the stream go by


---------72:19----------
and and all of a sudden i realized


---------72:22----------
there's a young boy


---------72:23----------
sitting next to me and about 10 years


---------72:26----------
old or so


---------72:27----------
and then i realized i know this boy um


---------72:30----------
i i know his father and his father is a


---------72:33----------
friend of mine


---------72:34----------
and at the time i had a large stash of


---------72:36----------
lsd


---------72:38----------
that i was scared of getting busted so i


---------72:39----------
had asked his father if he would store


---------72:41----------
my lsd stash at his house in his freezer


---------72:44----------
and his father had said yes so once i


---------72:46----------
connected this little boy in the dream


---------72:48----------
to lsd


---------72:50----------
then it all made sense then i woke up so


---------72:53----------
i feel that the karma for me is this


---------72:56----------
all these people that died because they


---------72:59----------
were dehumanized because


---------73:01----------
people were motivated by fears and


---------73:03----------
anxieties that


---------73:06----------
one of the many strategies that can be


---------73:08----------
helpful for that is this kind of


---------73:10----------
helping people understand how we're all


---------73:12----------
connected and helping people work


---------73:14----------
through their own fears and anxiety so


---------73:16----------
that they're not so easily manipulated


---------73:17----------
by


---------73:18----------
by them yeah so uh rick that's a great


---------73:21----------
segue i think to an important question


---------73:22----------
is that


---------73:23----------
we get a lot of people in our community


---------73:25----------
who are wondering okay so they've heard


---------73:26----------
your amazing story


---------73:28----------
right and i think a lot of people um you


---------73:32----------
know feel


---------73:32----------
directionless feel a little bit broken


---------73:35----------
have insecurities and anxieties of their


---------73:37----------
own


---------73:38----------
and want to partake in what you're


---------73:40----------
describing


---------73:42----------
so and i struggle with this too it's


---------73:44----------
interesting i actually have a


---------73:46----------
a patient who has treatment refractory


---------73:48----------
depression


---------73:50----------
who i'm trying to figure out how can i


---------73:52----------
help this person because i do think that


---------73:55----------
it's not like a neurochemical imbalance


---------73:57----------
or something i i really do think that


---------73:58----------
their depression is more spiritual in


---------74:00----------
nature


---------74:01----------
so what do people do who are interested


---------74:04----------
in this kind of healing


---------74:05----------
because as a medical doctor you know i


---------74:07----------
certainly won't


---------74:08----------
and and really can't recommend it right


---------74:10----------
now


---------74:11----------
um and and so but what do people do like


---------74:14----------
so we do get questions about


---------74:16----------
you know i i want to like figure out


---------74:18----------
what my purpose is


---------74:19----------
i want to feel less insecure i want to


---------74:22----------
heal


---------74:22----------
on a spiritual level what should what


---------74:24----------
should they do


---------74:26----------
well first off you can recommend


---------74:29----------
ketamine to people ketamine isn't a


---------74:31----------
medicine for um refactory depression


---------74:33----------
sometimes it does help people have


---------74:35----------
spiritual experiences


---------74:37----------
i i think the first thing and we sort of


---------74:39----------
talked about this earlier


---------74:41----------
is that what's legal and what's moral


---------74:44----------
are two different things


---------74:45----------
so everybody has to decide for


---------74:47----------
themselves


---------74:49----------
to what extent are you going to respect


---------74:51----------
certain laws and to what extent


---------74:53----------
are you not going to so you know


---------74:57----------
that's for each person to decide for


---------74:58----------
themselves what risks are you willing to


---------75:00----------
take


---------75:00----------
um one of the incredible things about


---------75:03----------
stan that i think


---------75:04----------
stan groff that was so remarkable is


---------75:06----------
when psychedelics were criminalized


---------75:08----------
a lot of people who had been psycho


---------75:10----------
research said okay


---------75:12----------
it's taken out of our hands let's


---------75:13----------
explore meditation let's explore other


---------75:15----------
things


---------75:16----------
and then some of even like we don't need


---------75:18----------
psychedelics anymore you know there's


---------75:19----------
other ways to get there which is true


---------75:21----------
there are other ways to get there but


---------75:23----------
what stan did


---------75:25----------
was to see that that kind of


---------75:27----------
non-ordinary state of consciousness that


---------75:29----------
was produced by psychedelics was very


---------75:31----------
valuable


---------75:32----------
and he developed an approach called the


---------75:34----------
holotropic breath work which is


---------75:35----------
hyperventilation


---------75:37----------
with support in groups to let these


---------75:41----------
deeper experiences come out so anybody


---------75:43----------
legally anywhere can look for


---------75:45----------
holotropic breathwork practitioners and


---------75:47----------
there's quite a few hundreds that have


---------75:49----------
been trained around the country


---------75:51----------
and around the world even more that


---------75:54----------
practice holotropic breath work or other


---------75:56----------
kinds of therapies so people can go to


---------75:58----------
therapies


---------76:00----------
i think that there there's um it's a


---------76:03----------
very small place but it's called peyote


---------76:05----------
way church


---------76:06----------
of god and you can go on an individual


---------76:09----------
vision quest with peyote you know


---------76:11----------
they they're part of the native american


---------76:13----------
church they've got a legal context for


---------76:15----------
it


---------76:16----------
you know you know it's not that big but


---------76:19----------
they have it set up for people to take


---------76:21----------
they


---------76:21----------
and wander off you know in a special


---------76:24----------
place where they're


---------76:25----------
camping you can also look for ayahuasca


---------76:27----------
churches


---------76:28----------
cert in america there's quite a lot of


---------76:29----------
ayahuasca experiences that


---------76:32----------
that the two churches uned vegetable and


---------76:34----------
santo dami are legal


---------76:36----------
but um you know most of the ayahuasca


---------76:40----------
circles are not exactly in those kind of


---------76:42----------
settings but you could try those um but


---------76:44----------
i i also think that


---------76:46----------
there are um a lot that can be done with


---------76:49----------
close friends


---------76:50----------
you know a lot of peer support so


---------76:53----------
because you know at college we have this


---------76:55----------
all night dance parties what maps is


---------76:56----------
doing


---------76:57----------
on the one hand it's mostly uh drug


---------77:00----------
development


---------77:00----------
mdma assisted psychotherapy for ptsd


---------77:02----------
through the fda


---------77:04----------
but we also have what we call the zendo


---------77:06----------
project which is psychedelic harm


---------77:07----------
reduction for people


---------77:09----------
who have difficult trips that take it


---------77:12----------
outside of medical context how do we


---------77:13----------
help them


---------77:14----------
so we train all sorts of people in this


---------77:17----------
so people could look at the maps.org


---------77:19----------
website


---------77:20----------
and we have training materials about


---------77:24----------
zendo how do you help somebody with


---------77:26----------
difficult trips we also have what's


---------77:27----------
called the treatment manual


---------77:29----------
for our mdma assisted psychotherapy for


---------77:31----------
ptsd


---------77:32----------
so you go to the research menu bar mdma


---------77:35----------
near the bottom of it it's called um


---------77:38----------
treatment manual that explains how our


---------77:40----------
therapeutic approach is done and you can


---------77:42----------
practice it on your own with your


---------77:43----------
friends um


---------77:45----------
sitting for you or or you can sit for


---------77:47----------
your friends i i think that


---------77:49----------
um it's difficult you know to find


---------77:53----------
ways to channel that interest at a time


---------77:56----------
where we still are living under


---------77:57----------
prohibition um you know denver has made


---------78:00----------
the mushrooms the lowest enforcement


---------78:02----------
priority so now has


---------78:04----------
oakland so as ann arbor there's the


---------78:06----------
oregon psilocybin initiative that's


---------78:08----------
going to be on the ballot


---------78:09----------
so there are more opportunities for


---------78:11----------
people to go to certain


---------78:13----------
areas and have these experience you can


---------78:15----------
go to the netherlands amsterdam for


---------78:17----------
mushroom experiences there are


---------78:18----------
all sorts of people that bring groups


---------78:19----------
there there's going to south america for


---------78:22----------
ayahuasca


---------78:23----------
personally i i prefer things in my own


---------78:25----------
cultural context


---------78:27----------
um but you know some people really like


---------78:29----------
going into these other contexts i think


---------78:32----------
that what you can do is


---------78:34----------
study humanistic and transpersonal


---------78:36----------
psychology


---------78:37----------
uh transpersonal psychology is sort of


---------78:41----------
beyond the person trans it's what we


---------78:43----------
share in common and it does have a lot


---------78:45----------
to do with these kind of spiritual


---------78:46----------
mystical states but it also


---------78:48----------
has a lot to do with you know just


---------78:50----------
regular psychodynamics and what's the


---------78:52----------
root of a lot of the problems


---------78:54----------
and and i think that there are going to


---------78:57----------
be


---------78:59----------
over the next um couple of years we're


---------79:02----------
hoping now we anticipate


---------79:04----------
that if our research continues to go


---------79:06----------
well


---------79:07----------
sometime in early 2023 we should have


---------79:09----------
mdma assisted psychotherapy approved for


---------79:12----------
ptsd as a prescription drug


---------79:14----------
the people working with psilocybin are


---------79:16----------
are thinking


---------79:17----------
maybe the end of 2023 2024 they'll have


---------79:19----------
psilocybin approved


---------79:21----------
we'll be setting up all these


---------79:22----------
psychedelic clinics and the therapists


---------79:24----------
all want to be cross-trained they don't


---------79:26----------
want to be an mdma therapist or a


---------79:28----------
psilocybin


---------79:28----------
therapist or a ketamine therapist they


---------79:30----------
want to be a therapist that knows all


---------79:31----------
these different


---------79:32----------
modalities that we're really trying to


---------79:34----------
bring in a new


---------79:36----------
field of psychedelic psychotherapy where


---------79:38----------
the psychedelic psychotherapists have


---------79:39----------
the range of psychedelics available to


---------79:41----------
them and they customize the treatments


---------79:43----------
according to the individual


---------79:46----------
i think people who are struggling now


---------79:50----------
um it's difficult one way to


---------79:54----------
look at it is clinicaltrials.gov


---------79:57----------
if you go to clinicaltrials.gov


---------79:59----------
pharmaceutical companies sponsors have


---------80:01----------
to list their studies there and you can


---------80:03----------
put in drug and condition


---------80:04----------
and you can see what studies are


---------80:06----------
available that you could maybe volunteer


---------80:08----------
for there are even studies some of them


---------80:11----------
that need healthy volunteers where you


---------80:12----------
can


---------80:13----------
volunteer and get psilocybin or mdma you


---------80:15----------
know as part of the control groups or


---------80:17----------
something


---------80:18----------
interesting so i i think there's


---------80:20----------
opportunities for people but but


---------80:23----------
many of them if they are involving


---------80:25----------
psychedelics are going to be against the


---------80:26----------
law


---------80:27----------
and so that's really up to each


---------80:29----------
individual's moral compass


---------80:31----------
you know what what they feel about that


---------80:33----------
um but but also i would say to people


---------80:35----------
um don't give up hope you know that the


---------80:37----------
things are coming around


---------80:38----------
the things are changing and there will


---------80:40----------
be um increasing opportunities


---------80:43----------
and the other big thing i'll say is


---------80:46----------
dreams you know we tend to undervalue


---------80:48----------
dreams


---------80:48----------
dreams are incredible tools freud called


---------80:51----------
them the royal road to the unconscious


---------80:53----------
you know jung did all sorts of stuff


---------80:55----------
about his dreams um you know i just


---------80:57----------
described to you one of the most


---------80:58----------
important dreams in my whole life that


---------81:00----------
that's really influenced me my sense of


---------81:02----------
karma what i've been passed on


---------81:04----------
through my forebears in a sense so i i


---------81:07----------
think people


---------81:09----------
can spend a lot of time just focus on


---------81:11----------
your dreams and if you don't remember


---------81:13----------
them in the morning just


---------81:14----------
have a dream journal you write that down


---------81:16----------
and um


---------81:17----------
even if you write down i dreamt nothing


---------81:19----------
um you know over time you'll get


---------81:21----------
better and better you'll remember more


---------81:24----------
and that can be a powerful tool for you


---------81:26----------
to work on psychodynamic issues


---------81:29----------
yeah thank you so much for kind of


---------81:31----------
offering that perspective i think um


---------81:33----------
you know just one or two thoughts that i


---------81:35----------
kind of have one is that


---------81:36----------
i think holotropic breath work is pretty


---------81:38----------
interesting i think it has a lot of


---------81:40----------
roots


---------81:41----------
actually in kundalini brown i am yeah


---------81:44----------
yeah and so i actually sort of steer


---------81:47----------
clear of holotropic breath work because


---------81:49----------
i think sometimes it can have i think it


---------81:51----------
needs to be done with the right kind of


---------81:52----------
setting


---------81:53----------
um it can bring stuff to the surface the


---------81:56----------
same way that it's like delicate


---------81:57----------
experiences yep


---------81:58----------
yeah and and so when i was studying


---------81:59----------
kundalini yoga myself i mean it was done


---------82:02----------
in isolation


---------82:03----------
actually precisely for that reason so


---------82:04----------
like you're done it's done with a guru


---------82:06----------
and like


---------82:07----------
it's very intensive and and what my


---------82:10----------
teachers told me is that it's kind of


---------82:11----------
playing with fire and it can be


---------82:13----------
powerful and transformative and it can


---------82:15----------
also really


---------82:17----------
kind of mess you up if you until you


---------82:19----------
learn how to integrate it


---------82:21----------
i mean the interesting thing is in


---------82:22----------
either case the experience is powerful


---------82:24----------
it's really i


---------82:25----------
really like your emphasis on integration


---------82:28----------
afterward it's it's when you kind of


---------82:29----------
talk it through or work it through with


---------82:30----------
a


---------82:31----------
with a guru um that really i think you


---------82:34----------
can


---------82:34----------
really change uh one other thought that


---------82:37----------
that i i kind of just want to share is


---------82:39----------
that


---------82:40----------
you know i had some realization i don't


---------82:42----------
know if this is entirely true of


---------82:43----------
psychedelics but i think it's sort of


---------82:44----------
theoretically true that


---------82:46----------
if you think about chemical substances


---------82:48----------
they don't really


---------82:49----------
change our brain really what they do is


---------82:51----------
activate it


---------82:52----------
right so you look at any any compound


---------82:55----------
and and


---------82:55----------
what it serves as an activator like if


---------82:58----------
you think about marijuana they're


---------82:59----------
endogenous cannabinoids they're


---------83:01----------
endogenous opioids


---------83:03----------
um i don't know necessarily that what


---------83:05----------
they're what we would call endogenous


---------83:07----------
psychedelic compounds but


---------83:09----------
it's been my understanding and what my


---------83:11----------
teachers have told me is that


---------83:12----------
essentially


---------83:13----------
you know if you take if you use


---------83:16----------
something like mdma like this


---------83:17----------
this monk that you mentioned sort of


---------83:19----------
said that 30 years of dedication you can


---------83:22----------
achieve that in one moment with with


---------83:23----------
mdma and i think that that's true


---------83:26----------
i think that the the interesting thing


---------83:28----------
about


---------83:29----------
meditation is that you know you sort of


---------83:31----------
learn how to cultivate a particular


---------83:33----------
branch


---------83:34----------
of spiritual experience and my


---------83:36----------
experience


---------83:37----------
or my understanding has been that in


---------83:39----------
psychedelics you know different


---------83:41----------
compounds will lead to generally


---------83:42----------
speaking different kinds of experiences


---------83:45----------
but when you take a substance you don't


---------83:46----------
really know what you're signing up for


---------83:49----------
um exactly well stan groff has talked


---------83:51----------
about lsd


---------83:52----------
as a non-specific amplifier of the


---------83:55----------
unconscious


---------83:56----------
yeah which means that you don't know


---------83:58----------
what's going to come up and


---------83:59----------
your conscious mind can't predict it you


---------84:01----------
could even have a list of


---------84:03----------
all the things that you want to deal


---------84:05----------
with during this session and what


---------84:07----------
emerges may be completely different yeah


---------84:10----------
that's interesting


---------84:11----------
yeah so i know you've got to run well i


---------84:13----------
do have a bit more time if


---------84:16----------
so i i think you know another 10 15


---------84:18----------
minutes uh


---------84:19----------
i mean i i think rick though the richest


---------84:21----------
the best part of this i think has been


---------84:23----------
your stories bro


---------84:24----------
like i think i think hearing your


---------84:26----------
stories has been has been eye-opening


---------84:28----------
man


---------84:28----------
it's such an interesting background and


---------84:30----------
it's so interesting because i


---------84:32----------
you know i had envisioned you as as you


---------84:34----------
know this this phd who had


---------84:36----------
done research and and just to hear a


---------84:39----------
little bit about your life has been


---------84:40----------
amazing


---------84:41----------
um okay well i have two another story i


---------84:44----------
think that yeah


---------84:45----------
maybe so this comes up with maps of


---------84:47----------
strategy so this is where i really


---------84:50----------
um so this is a story of two days one


---------84:52----------
day where i did dmt the next day


---------84:54----------
ketamine and so again back in 1985


---------84:58----------
so this is you know 35 years ago but but


---------85:01----------
really maps his strategy evolved from


---------85:03----------
that from


---------85:04----------
in a sense from those experiences and


---------85:06----------
what i mean by our strategy is


---------85:08----------
on the one hand is drug development on


---------85:10----------
the other hand is drug policy reform and


---------85:12----------
trying to


---------85:14----------
work on what's called mass mental health


---------85:17----------
that


---------85:18----------
we want to help people that are


---------85:19----------
suffering first that's the doorway into


---------85:21----------
a frightened culture that's been


---------85:24----------
scared about psychedelics that has a lot


---------85:26----------
of misinformation


---------85:28----------
that that is um the opening uh wedge you


---------85:31----------
could say medicalizing


---------85:33----------
but that we all need this kind of


---------85:36----------
mission purpose uh meaning


---------85:39----------
um and healing and growth even if we


---------85:41----------
don't have a clinical diagnosis


---------85:44----------
so masses had this parallel strategy and


---------85:46----------
so


---------85:47----------
where that sort of came um


---------85:51----------
from was these two experiences um


---------85:54----------
also took place at esslin and this was


---------85:57----------
with the groups of people that were


---------85:58----------
gathering to try to figure out how to


---------86:00----------
protect the use of mdma


---------86:02----------
as a therapeutic drug so


---------86:05----------
one day we did dmt this was with terence


---------86:08----------
mckenna ralph metzner a bunch of other


---------86:11----------
people that were very um experienced i


---------86:14----------
had never done dmt and and so the way we


---------86:16----------
did it was


---------86:17----------
there was about eight of us sitting in a


---------86:18----------
room and one person would would smoke


---------86:21----------
the dmt


---------86:22----------
it takes around 10 minutes you just lie


---------86:24----------
back and you have this experience and


---------86:25----------
then you come back


---------86:26----------
and you share a little bit with the


---------86:28----------
other people about what happened so this


---------86:30----------
is the integration part


---------86:32----------
and then you pass the pipe to the next


---------86:33----------
person and then they do it and then each


---------86:35----------
person in sequence will have this


---------86:37----------
um dmt experience


---------86:41----------
and so for me the the dmt which i'd


---------86:44----------
never taken before


---------86:45----------
um it's very powerful now it's the main


---------86:48----------
active ingredient in ayahuasca


---------86:50----------
but when you take it in oral form it


---------86:52----------
comes on slower


---------86:54----------
it lasts longer when you smoke it it's


---------86:56----------
about a 10 minute experience and so


---------86:58----------
the the first thing that i experienced


---------87:01----------
was just uh


---------87:03----------
you smoke it you sort of fall back


---------87:06----------
i just felt there there's a line there


---------87:08----------
was just like a horizontal line


---------87:10----------
and then there was a vertical line and


---------87:13----------
then it turned red it was a color and


---------87:15----------
then it started assembling in


---------87:17----------
cubes so it became kind of um


---------87:20----------
three-dimensional


---------87:21----------
and and then it rapidly turned into like


---------87:23----------
an m.c escher kind of drawing where the


---------87:25----------
the dimensions didn't quite work and


---------87:27----------
then i was blasted into


---------87:28----------
sort of the universe and all of that is


---------87:30----------
like fraction of a second


---------87:32----------
but you know this was the progression of


---------87:34----------
it and so then i


---------87:35----------
i felt like i was part of creation part


---------87:37----------
of this uh big bang and


---------87:39----------
and and at one point i had this thought


---------87:43----------
which is amazing in a way that you can


---------87:44----------
still be thinking


---------87:46----------
um even though your normal orientation


---------87:48----------
is not there


---------87:49----------
that in the most inner parts of myself


---------87:54----------
um and and you talked about this about


---------87:56----------
where are your thoughts located you know


---------87:57----------
and you're saying it's around here but i


---------87:58----------
thought inside


---------87:59----------
my my head where i i talk to myself


---------88:02----------
where i think


---------88:04----------
i'm using words and i didn't invent


---------88:07----------
these words


---------88:08----------
you know in the most private part of me


---------88:10----------
it's


---------88:11----------
from millions of people that have


---------88:14----------
developed the english language that have


---------88:15----------
developed


---------88:16----------
language that all of this might so the


---------88:18----------
part that i think is the most private in


---------88:20----------
a way is not


---------88:21----------
actually the most private it's it's


---------88:23----------
intimately connected with everything


---------88:25----------
that's come before and so i felt like


---------88:27----------
more and more it's just this beautiful


---------88:28----------
thought of this whole long stream of


---------88:30----------
evolution i'm part of everything and


---------88:33----------
and it just just felt great but then i


---------88:35----------
had this thought


---------88:36----------
which you know i've learned not to


---------88:39----------
disregard these thoughts but the thought


---------88:40----------
i had was if you're part of everything


---------88:42----------
and everything's part of you then hitler


---------88:44----------
is part of you too


---------88:46----------
it's not hitler out there i'm all good


---------88:48----------
that bad is out there the


---------88:50----------
the the hitler is part of me too i have


---------88:52----------
to own that


---------88:53----------
and that was just such a shattering


---------88:55----------
thought


---------88:56----------
that um


---------89:00----------
it just really brought me down and i i


---------89:03----------
felt like there's a logic to it i


---------89:05----------
i can't deny it um this inner hitler


---------89:08----------
and so it just depressed me


---------89:12----------
you could say and and the whole rest of


---------89:14----------
the day you know we went through i told


---------89:16----------
my story we went through the rest of the


---------89:17----------
other people's stories uh


---------89:19----------
but the whole rest of the day i was just


---------89:20----------
really wrestling with this thought that


---------89:22----------
um that there's this touch point where


---------89:24----------
part of me is hitler too that i can't


---------89:26----------
really disown that


---------89:28----------
um it was very kind of a somber day so


---------89:32----------
the the next evening we decided that we


---------89:34----------
would do ketamine


---------89:36----------
and this was intramuscular a hundred


---------89:39----------
milligrams ketamine intramuscular this


---------89:43----------
lasts


---------89:43----------
differently it lasts about an hour so we


---------89:46----------
didn't we all did it more simultaneously


---------89:47----------
we


---------89:48----------
we didn't want to you know one person


---------89:50----------
sit there while they would go out for an


---------89:52----------
hour and come back


---------89:53----------
all right so during this experience of


---------89:55----------
ketamine


---------89:57----------
um somehow or other i was


---------90:01----------
into a different space i was um


---------90:05----------
above and behind hitler as he was giving


---------90:08----------
a


---------90:09----------
speech to a a mass rally


---------90:13----------
and i'm thinking okay hitler's part of


---------90:16----------
me i'm potter hitler how do i get inside


---------90:19----------
this part of my head or how do i get


---------90:20----------
inside his head to


---------90:22----------
see about healing this murderous um


---------90:26----------
nature of what he's doing how do i


---------90:29----------
you know do this and and so that got me


---------90:32----------
really scared like i have to psych this


---------90:34----------
guy out i have to figure out what's


---------90:35----------
going on


---------90:36----------
and um and the more that i saw him do


---------90:39----------
these uh speeches


---------90:40----------
this particular speech um and


---------90:43----------
and then i got this sense a whole


---------90:45----------
different sense i'd never thought of


---------90:47----------
about the heil hitler salute the way it


---------90:49----------
was heil hitler and then everybody would


---------90:51----------
do it back to him


---------90:52----------
um and it it felt like this power from


---------90:56----------
the one to the many


---------90:57----------
so that he was doing the salute and then


---------90:59----------
they would all do it back to him


---------91:00----------
so it's like push out this energy and


---------91:03----------
then they would all give their energy


---------91:04----------
back to him


---------91:05----------
and then he would do it again and then


---------91:07----------
they would do it again and it felt like


---------91:09----------
this vibration that was getting stronger


---------91:11----------
and stronger that was increasing this


---------91:12----------
kind of


---------91:13----------
um connection between um you know him


---------91:17----------
they're all giving his power to him and


---------91:19----------
and i started thinking this is this is


---------91:21----------
terrifying i'm i i


---------91:22----------
and i i felt like i might freak out and


---------91:25----------
i had this image then of bubbles that


---------91:27----------
were like air bubbles that were coming


---------91:28----------
to the surface but these were fear


---------91:30----------
bubbles


---------91:30----------
and if these fear bubbles broke the


---------91:33----------
surface then then i would panic and i


---------91:34----------
wouldn't be able to really deal with it


---------91:36----------
and the the one of the good things about


---------91:39----------
ketamine is that it doesn't interfere


---------91:41----------
with your respiration


---------91:42----------
that's why it's such a good anesthetic


---------91:44----------
drug so i had the thought breathe


---------91:46----------
breathe if you just breathe


---------91:47----------
maybe you'll be able to not panic so


---------91:49----------
much so i was able to breathe


---------91:52----------
and i didn't panic and then i got this


---------91:56----------
thought that there is no way


---------91:59----------
to get inside of hitler's head he's


---------92:00----------
getting so much out of it


---------92:03----------
you know that p the same way for


---------92:05----------
psychedelic therapy is that people have


---------92:07----------
to be willing


---------92:08----------
to face things that they're the ones


---------92:10----------
that are doing the healing


---------92:11----------
they're the ones that are doing the hard


---------92:13----------
work you try to create a safe and


---------92:15----------
supportive setting and you prepare them


---------92:17----------
but in the end the therapist is not the


---------92:20----------
the magician that's making everything


---------92:22----------
happen it's the person


---------92:23----------
healing themselves and they have to be


---------92:24----------
willing and so i realized


---------92:27----------
that he wasn't willing


---------92:31----------
there was no way that i i from the


---------92:34----------
outside you know he ended up committing


---------92:36----------
suicide


---------92:38----------
not having any kind of change even after


---------92:40----------
all of germany was


---------92:41----------
you know destroyed and so many people


---------92:43----------
were died


---------92:44----------
um so i realized though that the


---------92:47----------
long-term strategy


---------92:49----------
has to be all of those people that were


---------92:52----------
giving away


---------92:53----------
their power to hitler they get a lot


---------92:55----------
less out of it


---------92:57----------
so that that's why we need mass mental


---------92:59----------
health


---------93:00----------
that the strategy for for maps the


---------93:02----------
strategy that i'm trying to put


---------93:04----------
forward is how do we help all these


---------93:07----------
people who are giving away their power


---------93:09----------
to dictators or authoritarians or


---------93:12----------
you know um we see this a lot in america


---------93:15----------
too people that are giving away their


---------93:16----------
rationality and their power


---------93:19----------
we have to it's it's going to be easier


---------93:20----------
to help each one of them


---------93:22----------
work through their traumas and fears so


---------93:24----------
that they don't give away their power so


---------93:25----------
ironically rather than changing one


---------93:27----------
person


---------93:28----------
it's changing 50 million people or more


---------93:32----------
and so that's where maps of strategy has


---------93:35----------
been that the medicalization


---------93:37----------
is a tool for


---------93:40----------
a larger change in consciousness


---------93:43----------
that can only come from embedding this


---------93:46----------
kind of


---------93:47----------
new awareness in millions and billions


---------93:49----------
of people


---------93:50----------
which then need drug policy reform as


---------93:52----------
well as


---------93:54----------
drug development so most of the um


---------93:57----------
non-profit or for-profit psychedelic


---------93:59----------
companies


---------94:00----------
are about um drug development they're


---------94:04----------
about


---------94:05----------
training other therapists treating


---------94:07----------
people and doing research


---------94:09----------
and so the difference between maps and


---------94:11----------
them is that we are really


---------94:13----------
about mass mental health


---------94:17----------
and going beyond just working with


---------94:19----------
people that have a diagnosis to try to


---------94:21----------
spiritualize


---------94:22----------
humanity as a whole yeah that's that's


---------94:25----------
great you know it's funny so someone


---------94:26----------
a couple months ago mentioned that what


---------94:28----------
we do at healthy gamer


---------94:30----------
is something called aoe healing and


---------94:33----------
aoe means area of effect and so the


---------94:37----------
implication is it's actually i think it


---------94:38----------
aligns perfectly with mass


---------94:40----------
mental health so i mean a big part of


---------94:43----------
our mission and


---------94:44----------
what we do is is exactly what you


---------94:46----------
described it's sort of the idea that


---------94:48----------
you know we think that we can try to


---------94:51----------
understand ourselves better as


---------94:52----------
individuals


---------94:54----------
and the reason that we have these


---------94:55----------
interviews is so that one person can


---------94:57----------
share their experience


---------94:59----------
right and then that your experience goes


---------95:01----------
out and affects a ton of people


---------95:03----------
and then those people create changes in


---------95:06----------
their life without


---------95:06----------
which i think definitely does feed back


---------95:09----------
to you or at least to me


---------95:11----------
um we had a pretty traumatic uh suicide


---------95:14----------
in our community a couple of months ago


---------95:17----------
and you know i think it was hard on me


---------95:21----------
but i i think it was


---------95:22----------
really interesting to feel everyone's


---------95:26----------
energy and support and


---------95:28----------
and how at the end of the day it's like


---------95:30----------
we're all on the same team


---------95:32----------
and you know we have to support each


---------95:34----------
other and and i'm with you a hundred


---------95:36----------
percent about sort of


---------95:38----------
you know fixing each individual person


---------95:40----------
kind of one at a time


---------95:42----------
but that's how you create a mass you you


---------95:44----------
sort of i mean


---------95:45----------
it's a beautiful way to put it i think


---------95:47----------
it's it aligns perfectly with


---------95:49----------
what we've evolved into because that's


---------95:51----------
what healthy gamer has become it's been


---------95:53----------
become a community of somewhere between


---------95:56----------
30 and 250 000 people depending on which


---------96:00----------
metric you use


---------96:01----------
um and you know we really try to support


---------96:04----------
each other and we we try to work on


---------96:06----------
ourselves


---------96:07----------
and we work on ourselves together even


---------96:09----------
the way that you kind of described the


---------96:11----------
dmt process like we have a you know a


---------96:13----------
community like our discord server where


---------96:16----------
people come and sort of share their


---------96:17----------
individual take on things


---------96:19----------
um and then we kind of go around and


---------96:21----------
people will share their own take on a


---------96:23----------
particular subject


---------96:26----------
we had like this particular channel that


---------96:28----------
was devoted to ego so people come in and


---------96:30----------
they talk about okay


---------96:31----------
what's my ego telling me to do how do i


---------96:33----------
understand my ego how does my ego


---------96:35----------
interfere with things


---------96:36----------
and one of the things that i love about


---------96:38----------
hearing these communities and


---------96:40----------
in our groups is that it's really hard


---------96:42----------
to see


---------96:44----------
your problems in you because of


---------96:46----------
cognitive bias


---------96:48----------
it's way easier to see your problem in


---------96:50----------
someone else


---------96:52----------
and you can learn so much when somebody


---------96:54----------
else is talking about the same thing


---------96:56----------
that you can


---------96:57----------
that you struggle with and you're like


---------96:59----------
oh wow that's exactly what i do


---------97:01----------
and it's so much clearer when you're


---------97:03----------
kind of working together with a group of


---------97:04----------
people and when you kind of integrate


---------97:06----------
different people's perspectives


---------97:07----------
you can learn so much more so it's


---------97:10----------
amazing and and i want to say one thing


---------97:13----------
about ego too which is


---------97:15----------
a couple times i've used the word ego


---------97:16----------
death but i've mostly used ego


---------97:18----------
dissolution


---------97:19----------
but um i think ego death gives people


---------97:21----------
the very wrong impression


---------97:23----------
um and so we need our ego we just need


---------97:26----------
our ego to be in the proper


---------97:28----------
place so the metaphor is that um


---------97:32----------
well stan sanderoff has said that the


---------97:34----------
psychedelics are the study of the mind


---------97:36----------
what the microscope is the biology and


---------97:38----------
the telescope is to astronomy


---------97:41----------
and so you know at times the telescope


---------97:43----------
has produced


---------97:45----------
knowledge that was very dangerous and


---------97:47----------
this was for the


---------97:48----------
status quo so this was in the time of


---------97:50----------
copernicus galileo and all


---------97:53----------
and so what we thought at the time or


---------97:55----------
what people thought at the time


---------97:56----------
that the earth was the center of the


---------97:58----------
universe and that everything revolved


---------98:00----------
around that


---------98:01----------
and as it turned out that's not the case


---------98:03----------
um


---------98:04----------
that um we revolve the earth revolves


---------98:06----------
around the sun the sun is just the minor


---------98:08----------
part of this galaxy there's


---------98:09----------
billions of galaxies and i think the


---------98:11----------
same thing is true of the


---------98:13----------
the ego is that we think everything


---------98:15----------
revolves around us but that


---------98:17----------
actually there's the bigger self the


---------98:18----------
bigger world and so we need to put the


---------98:20----------
ego in its place


---------98:22----------
uh but we we need to pay attention to


---------98:24----------
our own ego we are


---------98:25----------
bounded by life and death we are


---------98:27----------
individuals to be egoists


---------98:29----------
to not pay attention to that is also not


---------98:31----------
paying attention to a


---------98:33----------
a key part of reality which is that we


---------98:35----------
are real


---------98:36----------
human beings and we have uh to take care


---------98:39----------
of ourselves and to take care of each


---------98:40----------
other so


---------98:41----------
what stan has also said is that the ego


---------98:45----------
becomes transparent to the transcendent


---------98:50----------
it's like cleaning the window but the


---------98:51----------
window doesn't go away the window


---------98:53----------
protects from


---------98:55----------
various things so i i just think that um


---------98:59----------
you could get very punitive in this idea


---------99:00----------
that i got to have no ego


---------99:02----------
yeah that's really important that that's


---------99:04----------
where i think you get that spiritual ego


---------99:06----------
that you see a lot in spiritual circles


---------99:08----------
the ego of having no ego


---------99:10----------
look at how egoless i am yeah


---------99:14----------
and and so i i'm with you and i think


---------99:16----------
sort of there there's so much that i


---------99:18----------
could kind of relate to what you said


---------99:20----------
in in sanskrit and sort of yogic


---------99:22----------
traditions um


---------99:23----------
you know and i'll just leave you with


---------99:24----------
two or three like i think the most


---------99:26----------
relevant things the first is that


---------99:28----------
you know the yogis also say ego is a


---------99:30----------
function of mind just like emotions or


---------99:32----------
intellect it's just about who's in


---------99:34----------
control


---------99:35----------
is the ego in control of you or are you


---------99:37----------
in control of the ego


---------99:40----------
the second thing that i i kind of it's


---------99:42----------
it's interesting so there's there are


---------99:44----------
four


---------99:45----------
um mahavakyas which are like great


---------99:48----------
phrases


---------99:49----------
and i think these are sort of the


---------99:50----------
essence of what a lot of yogis


---------99:52----------
understood


---------99:53----------
and one of them is aham brahmasmi which


---------99:55----------
means i am the universe


---------99:57----------
and and i think this is very poorly


---------100:00----------
understood because i think people sort


---------100:01----------
of assume that this is kind of like a


---------100:04----------
yoga calendar sort of concept it's like


---------100:07----------
i am like you know we're all connected


---------100:09----------
like it's not an intellectual or a


---------100:11----------
physical philosophical concept


---------100:13----------
aham brahmasmi is the experience that


---------100:16----------
you are hitler and hitler is you


---------100:18----------
and that that like is is terrifying


---------100:22----------
as that is that essentially there is


---------100:24----------
some kind of


---------100:25----------
underlying unity which carl jung talks


---------100:27----------
about


---------100:28----------
which you know people who have


---------100:29----------
psychedelic experiences talk about and


---------100:31----------
the yogis talk about


---------100:33----------
which is that the self and the other


---------100:35----------
that there is atman which is individual


---------100:37----------
soul and paramatman which is universal


---------100:39----------
soul


---------100:39----------
and that essentially like there's one


---------100:41----------
ocean and you can pull a drop


---------100:43----------
out and is the drop no longer the ocean


---------100:46----------
is it a separate thing what happens to


---------100:47----------
the drop as it goes back into the ocean


---------100:50----------
you know and and so like a humbra masmi


---------100:52----------
is like the main thing that


---------100:55----------
when i sort of do meditative practices


---------100:57----------
on the hum brahmasmi i think i have


---------100:59----------
experiences somewhat like what you


---------101:00----------
describe


---------101:02----------
um but it's interesting that there's so


---------101:04----------
much overlap between like eastern


---------101:05----------
mysticism and a lot of what you're


---------101:07----------
describing


---------101:08----------
yeah i i guess i'd like to go back just


---------101:11----------
for a second and then i do have to go


---------101:13----------
um which is to the the the sadness that


---------101:15----------
you said about the person that committed


---------101:17----------
suicide that was part of the community


---------101:19----------
and this isn't just about that person


---------101:20----------
but


---------101:21----------
but i think a lot of times what happens


---------101:23----------
is people lose the connection to the


---------101:26----------
whole


---------101:26----------
they feel so isolated and alone


---------101:30----------
that life is unbearable but but they


---------101:33----------
they have somehow


---------101:34----------
lost that touch with the the bigger


---------101:37----------
like uh you know cradled in the arms of


---------101:39----------
gravity or that kind of


---------101:41----------
love that permeates the universe or even


---------101:43----------
being part of something bigger


---------101:45----------
that that that i think that experience


---------101:48----------
can help


---------101:49----------
people um as an antidote to suicide


---------101:54----------
yeah that's been my experience that a


---------101:56----------
lot of people who feel suicidal


---------101:58----------
ultimately what they feel the most


---------101:59----------
profoundly is alone


---------102:01----------
yes isolated and um


---------102:06----------
it's a it's interesting as a mental


---------102:07----------
health provider to to see


---------102:09----------
what works for suicide and what doesn't


---------102:11----------
and


---------102:12----------
i mean i think that's a conversation


---------102:14----------
maybe for a different day but


---------102:15----------
rick i know you got to get going thank


---------102:17----------
