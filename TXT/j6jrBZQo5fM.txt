---------00:00----------
this is not the life that i wanted right


---------00:01----------
i took all the right steps and i ended


---------00:03----------
up in the wrong place


---------00:05----------
i've wasted six years towards working uh


---------00:08----------
working towards a degree i hate


---------00:09----------
chemistry i'm also terrified of dropping


---------00:11----------
out


---------00:12----------
so hi some background info i used to be


---------00:14----------
a straight a student in high school


---------00:17----------
but didn't have any interest to pursue


---------00:19----------
in university so i applied to chemistry


---------00:21----------
because it was my highest grade


---------00:24----------
i have spent six long years in


---------00:25----------
university for a program i have zero


---------00:27----------
interest in and quite frankly despised


---------00:29----------
being in during these six years i've


---------00:30----------
taken many different subjects for my


---------00:33----------
electives in hopes of finding something


---------00:34----------
i'm passionate about math biology


---------00:37----------
kinesiology psychology philosophy


---------00:40----------
none of them really clicked for me but


---------00:42----------
now i'm considering a full switch into


---------00:43----------
computer science which would require me


---------00:45----------
to switch schools since my gpa is low


---------00:47----------
uh-oh


---------00:49----------
my problem is i'm incredibly ashamed of


---------00:51----------
how much time i've sunk oh look


---------00:53----------
it's almost like this is a test case


---------00:56----------
chat my problem is i'm incredibly


---------00:58----------
ashamed of how much i've sunk into this


---------01:00----------
degree that's made me extremely


---------01:01----------
miserable my peers are all graduated


---------01:03----------
there's the comparison some have jobs


---------01:06----------
some are starting a family some about to


---------01:07----------
compete their master's programs


---------01:09----------
meanwhile i feel anxious and depressed


---------01:11----------
being where they were six years ago


---------01:14----------
it feels so difficult to leave


---------01:16----------
leave it since it's really all i've had


---------01:18----------
in the past six years


---------01:19----------
i don't know if i'm capable of going


---------01:21----------
into a new degree and starting fresh at


---------01:23----------
the age of 24


---------01:24----------
but i also know i'll hate my life if i


---------01:27----------
stay


---------01:28----------
i'm also afraid of how my parents may


---------01:30----------
react when i tell them i've wasted so


---------01:32----------
much money in tuition rent etc my


---------01:34----------
parents worked extremely hard and i'm i


---------01:37----------
feel extremely grateful that they helped


---------01:39----------
me pay for my college funds


---------01:42----------
i feel this pressure to succeed and


---------01:43----------
provide for them like they did for me


---------01:45----------
but at the same time i've come to a


---------01:47----------
point where my mental health is


---------01:48----------
crumbling and i'm not sure how much more


---------01:49----------
of this i can take


---------01:50----------
my parents don't know i'm struggling


---------01:52----------
with these thoughts but even sharing


---------01:54----------
problems with them would make me feel


---------01:56----------
like a failure or disappointment


---------01:58----------
i don't really know what it is i think


---------02:00----------
i'll gain from posting this maybe i just


---------02:02----------
wanted to vent and hear other people's


---------02:04----------
thoughts


---------02:05----------
ps never been to therapy thought of


---------02:07----------
going to one provided by the school but


---------02:09----------
i've heard they treat students with


---------02:11----------
rude and with little respect


---------02:13----------
okay


---------02:15----------
so uh you know


---------02:18----------
let's talk about this all right so this


---------02:20----------
is the case of what seems like a 24 year


---------02:23----------
old who has been in college for


---------02:26----------
six years studying chemistry


---------02:29----------
feels obligated


---------02:31----------
to


---------02:33----------
stay and finish their degree really


---------02:35----------
hates their degree is burnt out


---------02:37----------
you know has some of the gifted syndrome


---------02:39----------
kind of stuff going on right so a's in


---------02:41----------
a's early on crappy gpa in college


---------02:45----------
a shame gap


---------02:46----------
that is based on what they're expecting


---------02:50----------
of themselves and what they're capable


---------02:51----------
of has a lot of comparison so what's


---------02:54----------
going on in this person and why


---------02:56----------
are more and more people at the age of


---------02:58----------
22 or 24 struggling to finish college


---------03:00----------
and like not sure what to do they feel


---------03:02----------
like trapped between continuing this


---------03:05----------
thing that they've already invested so


---------03:07----------
much in


---------03:08----------
versus kind of giving up and then like


---------03:10----------
if you give up like that's the last nail


---------03:12----------
in the coffin then you've really given


---------03:13----------
up and then like


---------03:15----------
you haven't really


---------03:16----------
wasted those six years right until you


---------03:19----------
give up


---------03:20----------
so this is the tricky thing about this


---------03:21----------
situation let's just talk about that for


---------03:23----------
a second


---------03:24----------
if you finish


---------03:25----------
the last six of your years of your life


---------03:27----------
haven't been a waste


---------03:29----------
right it just took a better late than


---------03:31----------
never it's not like you wasted six years


---------03:33----------
because at least they're counting


---------03:34----------
towards something took you a couple


---------03:35----------
other years but at least you didn't


---------03:36----------
waste it


---------03:38----------
whereas giving up which is what you want


---------03:39----------
to do more than anything else


---------03:41----------
means that you've wasted those six years


---------03:44----------
so now we really understand why this


---------03:46----------
person is stuck


---------03:48----------
because every day they continue they


---------03:49----------
haven't given up and if they haven't


---------03:51----------
given up they haven't wasted six years


---------03:52----------
of their life so they propagate they


---------03:55----------
stay in this dead


---------03:58----------
career path this dead major


---------04:01----------
for the sake of not wasting six years of


---------04:04----------
their life and in doing so they've


---------04:05----------
wasted six years of their life right


---------04:07----------
because now if you're giving up this


---------04:08----------
person probably had those thoughts like


---------04:09----------
even before they picked the major


---------04:12----------
but they sort of kept like plowing


---------04:13----------
forward like because


---------04:16----------
out of avoidance of giving up and


---------04:18----------
wasting all of that time because it's


---------04:20----------
all wasted if i give up


---------04:22----------
and so this is the biggest problem right


---------04:24----------
so this is how


---------04:26----------
kids nowadays i'm i guess this person


---------04:28----------
isn't a kid end up in what i call an


---------04:30----------
early life crisis


---------04:32----------
so a lot of times people talk about


---------04:34----------
mid-life crises right and traditionally


---------04:36----------
people will usually talk about men and


---------04:38----------
what will happen is like dudes will get


---------04:40----------
their hair colored like sometimes


---------04:41----------
they'll go through a divorce they'll


---------04:43----------
have an affair or even if they don't


---------04:45----------
have an affair go through divorce


---------04:47----------
they'll buy like some really expensive


---------04:49----------
car


---------04:50----------
that you know has a retractable roof


---------04:52----------
and they'll drive around and there's


---------04:53----------
like the mid-life crisis right


---------04:56----------
so what we're seeing time and time again


---------04:58----------
is what i would call the early life


---------05:00----------
crisis and there's like a generation of


---------05:01----------
people having an early life crisis and


---------05:04----------
this is a classic example of this like i


---------05:06----------
picked a major for all the wrong reasons


---------05:08----------
or i picked a career because i thought


---------05:10----------
it would be safe or good or whatever i'm


---------05:12----------
just deeply deeply unhappy in it i'm


---------05:13----------
burnt out i can't continue but i can't


---------05:15----------
stop


---------05:16----------
because if i stop it'll be a waste


---------05:19----------
and they're stuck so this is the early


---------05:21----------
life crisis so why is this happening


---------05:23----------
more than it used to


---------05:25----------
so what used to happen within a midlife


---------05:27----------
crisis is you got a lot of reassurance


---------05:30----------
that hey this is what you need to do


---------05:31----------
this week it'll get better at the end


---------05:32----------
it'll get better at the end it'll get


---------05:34----------
better at the end


---------05:35----------
and so you're kind of like blind right


---------05:37----------
like you're just kind of like you're


---------05:39----------
vote your fo your vision is like focused


---------05:41----------
and forward you kind of just chugging


---------05:42----------
along it'll get better i'll be happy one


---------05:44----------
day like once i'm done with school i'll


---------05:45----------
get a job then i'll be happy once you


---------05:47----------
get the job once i get promoted i'll be


---------05:48----------
happy because we're just told by


---------05:50----------
everyone that you'll be happy in the


---------05:51----------
future you'll be happy in the future


---------05:52----------
you'll be happy in the future


---------05:54----------
and then you you try that for a while 10


---------05:56----------
years 12 years 15 years and then you


---------05:58----------
kind of hit this mid-life crisis where


---------05:59----------
you're like this is not the life that i


---------06:01----------
wanted right i took all the right steps


---------06:03----------
and i ended up in the wrong place and


---------06:05----------
then you have this mid-life crisis i'm


---------06:06----------
40 years old like how can i start over


---------06:08----------
how do i find joy what happens sometimes


---------06:10----------
you get divorced sometimes you start


---------06:13----------
dating a 25 year old like you know there


---------06:15----------
are all kinds of things that that


---------06:17----------
mark the midlife crisis


---------06:19----------
so nowadays what we have is the early


---------06:20----------
life crisis and why is that


---------06:22----------
i think it's because there's an


---------06:23----------
increased awareness


---------06:25----------
that didn't used to be there so if we


---------06:27----------
look at the big difference between like


---------06:29----------
40 years ago and today


---------06:31----------
there's a dissemination of awareness i


---------06:33----------
mean dissemination of information and


---------06:35----------
increased awareness of like where things


---------06:36----------
are heading because people are


---------06:38----------
communicating more now right so this


---------06:40----------
person is posting this thing because


---------06:42----------
they've seen other people post similar


---------06:44----------
thoughts so there's almost like a


---------06:45----------
permission to explore these feelings to


---------06:47----------
have these feelings


---------06:50----------
we're all kind of more cosmically aware


---------06:52----------
that like if we put our heads down and


---------06:54----------
plow forward we're not guaranteed


---------06:56----------
success


---------06:57----------
that's the promise we were given like 30


---------06:59----------
40 years ago that's the promise of my


---------07:01----------
generation the millennial generation


---------07:03----------
promise we were given is that if you put


---------07:04----------
your head down and you work really hard


---------07:06----------
you'll be happy


---------07:07----------
turned out that that wasn't the case and


---------07:09----------
so our my generation the millennials


---------07:11----------
like we all sort of suffered for a while


---------07:13----------
right like we're trying to figure this


---------07:15----------
out and then like the generation beneath


---------07:17----------
us recognizes they're so much more


---------07:19----------
self-aware than they've ever been


---------07:21----------
they're so much more aware that like


---------07:22----------
life on autopilot is not going to bring


---------07:24----------
you happiness so people start to


---------07:26----------
question more they start to wonder more


---------07:27----------
they start to like recognize like oh i'm


---------07:29----------
burnt out like this is becoming more of


---------07:31----------
a thing


---------07:32----------
and so we have early life crises so


---------07:35----------
here's my experience as a psychiatrist


---------07:37----------
having an early life crisis is way


---------07:38----------
better than having a mid-life crisis so


---------07:41----------
in a weird way i think this is actually


---------07:42----------
healthy for our society


---------07:44----------
so when i was struggling 24 years old


---------07:46----------
had just graduated from college and


---------07:49----------
couldn't get a job


---------07:50----------
had applied to medical school got 40


---------07:52----------
rejections


---------07:54----------
you know couldn't get a job as a


---------07:55----------
research assistant like i didn't know


---------07:56----------
what i was doing with my life like i


---------07:58----------
wasn't doing anything


---------08:00----------
so i had to do a lot of hard soul


---------08:01----------
searching and thankfully i did that soul


---------08:03----------
searching when i was like 24


---------08:05----------
and then like figured things out by the


---------08:07----------
time i was 28


---------08:08----------
and then it was fine because i had sort


---------08:10----------
of figured everything out and i don't


---------08:11----------
think i'm headed towards a midlife


---------08:12----------
crisis


---------08:13----------
right so i'm almost 40 now but you know


---------08:16----------
i'm not ex


---------08:17----------
generally speaking things are going


---------08:18----------
pretty good so i don't think i'm gonna


---------08:19----------
wake up in three years and be like


---------08:21----------
i made a mistake where did my life go


---------08:23----------
i'm pretty happy with how things have


---------08:24----------
gone and i do think that i would have


---------08:26----------
been very unhappy if i hadn't gone


---------08:28----------
through that process


---------08:30----------
so this is the thing if you all are in


---------08:31----------
an early life crisis i think there are a


---------08:33----------
couple of really important things to


---------08:34----------
recognize the first is to recognize that


---------08:36----------
what you're going through is actually


---------08:38----------
quite common and it's actually really


---------08:40----------
important that the early life crisis is


---------08:42----------
a voice within you that's actually


---------08:45----------
trying to guide you you're not wasting


---------08:46----------
your life by giving up on chemistry


---------08:49----------
you're starting to live your life


---------08:51----------
there are a couple of things that are


---------08:53----------
really important to recognize here one


---------08:55----------
is that this person


---------08:56----------
you know we tend to only value things


---------08:59----------
that move towards our final goal


---------09:02----------
so for me for example like i'm not


---------09:04----------
really much of a clinician now right i


---------09:06----------
do maybe i see five to ten hours of


---------09:08----------
patients per week


---------09:10----------
and and like but it took me years and


---------09:12----------
years of seeing patients to realize


---------09:16----------
that


---------09:17----------
like


---------09:18----------
it's not actually my favorite thing in


---------09:20----------
the world


---------09:21----------
and so sometimes i think what we


---------09:22----------
underestimate is like the value of


---------09:24----------
education so what i mean by education is


---------09:26----------
not what you learn in school but like


---------09:28----------
spending six years of your life to like


---------09:30----------
discover what you truly love or look for


---------09:33----------
what you truly love and realize that oh


---------09:34----------
i'm not going to like changing majors is


---------09:37----------
not the solution to finding what i truly


---------09:39----------
love


---------09:40----------
that's a very very important discovery


---------09:42----------
because what it means is that no major


---------09:44----------
will satisfy you so you shouldn't pick


---------09:46----------
your major based on satisfaction you


---------09:48----------
need to start looking for satisfaction


---------09:49----------
in other ways maybe cs will be in the


---------09:52----------
right direction


---------09:53----------
this is the other thing is because we


---------09:55----------
expect


---------09:56----------
our majors or our careers or our classes


---------09:59----------
to fulfill us


---------10:00----------
whereas learning that


---------10:02----------
your major is not going to give you


---------10:04----------
fulfillment is actually a very very


---------10:06----------
important lesson why is that because


---------10:08----------
that changes your expectations


---------10:10----------
okay i'm not going to find my passion in


---------10:12----------
college so i might as well pick


---------10:13----------
something i know it's going to suck


---------10:15----------
i'm not expecting it to be anything


---------10:16----------
better than that you let go of your


---------10:17----------
expectations you'll start enjoying it


---------10:20----------
so it's it's the price of education it's


---------10:23----------
the price of learning and you have a


---------10:24----------
mid-life crisis you have an early life


---------10:26----------
crisis


---------10:27----------
so i think the best thing to do if


---------10:28----------
you're in an early life crisis is kind


---------10:30----------
of listen to yourself recognize also


---------10:32----------
that you haven't necessarily wasted time


---------10:35----------
you just spent time learning what you


---------10:36----------
didn't like


---------10:38----------
right so finding your favorite food


---------10:40----------
is not about just eating your favorite


---------10:42----------
food right it's about trying lots of


---------10:44----------
different things until you find


---------10:45----------
something that you like


---------10:46----------
finding the right person assuming that


---------10:48----------
you're into monogamy and all that good


---------10:50----------
stuff like you want to get married right


---------10:52----------
so it's sort of a different it's a value


---------10:54----------
system that i'm assuming there


---------10:56----------
like finding the right person to marry


---------10:58----------
involves looking through a lot of wrong


---------11:00----------
people right that's just how it works


---------11:03----------
and so something about the way that we


---------11:05----------
judge ourselves when it comes to life is


---------11:07----------
that the only thing that the benchmark


---------11:09----------
that we set ourselves up against is


---------11:11----------
perfection


---------11:12----------
4.0 in high school 4.0 in college off to


---------11:16----------
start your own company or go to law


---------11:18----------
school or get an mba and then i'm going


---------11:21----------
to go vp of this at this place then i'm


---------11:24----------
going to do this and then i'm going to


---------11:25----------
get stock options and i'm going to go


---------11:26----------
here and i'm gonna start my own company


---------11:28----------
and i'm gonna be i'm gonna retire at 45


---------11:31----------
right we expect nothing but perfection


---------11:34----------
from ourselves there's no time in our in


---------11:37----------
our


---------11:37----------
plan for life for detours or like


---------11:40----------
learning things or figuring things out


---------11:42----------
like we just expect ourselves to just


---------11:44----------
think about how absurd this is we expect


---------11:46----------
18 year old kids who have never been in


---------11:47----------
college and have no idea what they want


---------11:49----------
to do with their life to pick a major


---------11:51----------
that sort of commits them to a career


---------11:53----------
path like what the hell


---------11:55----------
how on earth are you supposed to commit


---------11:56----------
you get an 18 year old to commit to a


---------11:58----------
career path


---------11:59----------
they've never done anything


---------12:00----------
but this is the way that society exists


---------12:03----------
they ask you to make commitments and


---------12:04----------
then you get into the sunk cost fallacy


---------12:07----------
right where it's like throwing good


---------12:08----------
money after bad well i did chemistry


---------12:10----------
because it's the best score that i had


---------12:11----------
so i might as well do something i'm good


---------12:12----------
at


---------12:14----------
and then you spend you


---------12:15----------
are doing chemistry for one year and


---------12:17----------
you're like well


---------12:18----------
it's not like i like anything else so


---------12:20----------
let me continue chemistry you do


---------12:21----------
chemistry for two years well i'm not


---------12:22----------
really liking this so much let me try


---------12:23----------
kinesiology let me try physiology it's


---------12:25----------
not like i like any of those things i


---------12:26----------
guess i'll stick with chemistry year


---------12:28----------
four


---------12:28----------
i don't actually like chemistry so i'm


---------12:30----------
going to drop half these classes i i


---------12:32----------
can't motivate myself year five years


---------12:34----------
six


---------12:36----------
it's like what else am i going to do i


---------12:37----------
don't know so i might as well just keep


---------12:38----------
doing this


---------12:41----------
so it's it's terrifying


---------12:44----------
like the situations that we put people


---------12:46----------
in


---------12:47----------
and so now what's happening is there's a


---------12:48----------
raised awareness of this people are


---------12:50----------
realizing like oh other people are


---------12:51----------
unhappy too it's actually okay to be


---------12:53----------
unhappy so then they post things like


---------12:55----------
this and then you have an early life


---------12:56----------
crisis what do i want to do with my life


---------12:58----------
that's what our entire audience is it's


---------13:00----------
like a group of people having an early


---------13:01----------
life crisis


---------13:02----------
and like because


---------13:04----------
you know we have more than five viewers


---------13:05----------
it seems like it's a societal problem


---------13:08----------
which is totally okay so i had an early


---------13:10----------
life crisis i thought it was fantastic i


---------13:11----------
think the best thing that ever happened


---------13:12----------
to me


---------13:13----------
i would be so miserable if i got into


---------13:15----------
medical school right away because then i


---------13:18----------
would have like become a cardiologist or


---------13:20----------
surgeon or something like that because


---------13:21----------
it was all about ego


---------13:23----------
i i would have been embarrassed to


---------13:24----------
become a psychiatrist even though it's


---------13:25----------
what i love


---------13:26----------
i'd have been like that's not a real


---------13:28----------
doctor like people aren't gonna like be


---------13:29----------
like oh


---------13:31----------
psychiatrist is not a real doctor


---------13:33----------
you know like all that stupid ego stuff


---------13:35----------
would have dictated my life


---------13:37----------
and i would have been miserable


---------13:39----------
but i've been rich and miserable


---------13:42----------
instead


---------13:43----------
i'm streaming on twitch and wearing a


---------13:45----------
hoodie and this is my work for the day


---------13:48----------
right


---------13:50----------
and so i know it's it's terrifying but


---------13:51----------
like


---------13:52----------
take the time that you need to figure


---------13:54----------
out the things that you need to figure


---------13:55----------
out very practically if you have to have


---------13:56----------
conversations with your parents you have


---------13:58----------
conversations with your parents


---------14:00----------
and like what you tell your parents is


---------14:02----------
look


---------14:04----------
i've tried my level best to make this


---------14:05----------
work i'm just incredibly unhappy


---------14:08----------
and


---------14:10----------
you know i don't really think that


---------14:13----------
like


---------14:13----------
this is gonna work for me


---------14:15----------
it's gonna be tough


---------14:17----------
you know


---------14:19----------
and like i'm trying to figure out how to


---------14:22----------
honor your sacrifice


---------14:24----------
i'm trying to figure out how to do


---------14:25----------
something that i can repay everything


---------14:27----------
that you've done for me with


---------14:28----------
but i just don't think it's chemistry


---------14:30----------
and i need some time to try to figure


---------14:32----------
that out and i like to like explore what


---------14:34----------
to do with my life i tried living on


---------14:36----------
autopilot for far too long and it's just


---------14:38----------
not working


---------14:39----------
and this is the key thing that you


---------14:40----------
really have to understand


---------14:42----------
so for all these people who are in early


---------14:44----------
life crisis here's the key thing to


---------14:46----------
remember


---------14:48----------
it's


---------14:49----------
it's the avoidance of the conflict


---------14:52----------
that keeps you paralyzed and stuck on


---------14:54----------
autopilot right so in this person it's


---------14:56----------
like coming to terms with like dropping


---------14:58----------
out of college


---------15:00----------
kept you major in in chemistry


---------15:02----------
coming to terms with


---------15:05----------
disappointing your parents is too hard


---------15:07----------
so you're not going to say anything to


---------15:08----------
them because even telling them you're


---------15:10----------
going to feel like a failure so it's the


---------15:11----------
avoidance of that conflict which keeps


---------15:14----------
you in autopilot because you're like


---------15:16----------
sticking your head in this end you're


---------15:17----------
like this is not working anymore but i


---------15:20----------
can't change it i can't disappoint


---------15:21----------
people i can't quit i can't do any of


---------15:23----------
those things even though every fiber of


---------15:25----------
my being is telling me to do those


---------15:26----------
things and so internally you're tortured


---------15:30----------
you're stuck you're being pulled in two


---------15:32----------
different directions you're being torn


---------15:34----------
apart because you want to avoid the


---------15:36----------
negative consequence you want to avoid


---------15:37----------
the conflict you're scared of what your


---------15:40----------
parents will say or think so instead of


---------15:42----------
actually fixing the problem all you do


---------15:44----------
is pretend that everything is okay so


---------15:46----------
your parents


---------15:48----------
don't realize we can't let them know


---------15:50----------
that you're not really enjoying yourself


---------15:53----------
they may put two and two together


---------15:54----------
because first of all they're your


---------15:55----------
parents and secondly you've been in


---------15:56----------
undergrad for six years so maybe they


---------15:58----------
may know something is up but let's not


---------15:59----------
worry about that right now


---------16:01----------
right it's recognizing that internally


---------16:03----------
you're not willing to like grieve or


---------16:05----------
give up or mourn the price of what


---------16:07----------
you've done so you say stay stuck and


---------16:09----------
then year seven goes by year eight goes


---------16:11----------
by year nine goes by and if you do that


---------16:13----------
for a while then you end up with a


---------16:14----------
midlife crisis


---------16:16----------
that's what all the people with midlife


---------16:17----------
crises were doing


---------16:19----------
they would just keep plowing forward to


---------16:20----------
avoid conflict and don't accept what's


---------16:23----------
actually wrong in your life don't try to


---------16:24----------
do anything about it


---------16:26----------
just pretend everything is okay


---------16:28----------
it's like the band continuing to play


---------16:30----------
when the titanic is sinking


---------16:32----------
just pretend the problem doesn't exist


---------16:33----------
i'm not listening


---------16:35----------
[Music]


---------16:37----------
right so it's really challenging to


---------16:41----------
confront your fears


---------16:43----------
so now we're going to give you a nyani


---------16:44----------
yoga practice for that


---------16:46----------
you guys may think that oh path of


---------16:48----------
knowledge that's great i don't actually


---------16:49----------
have to sit down and meditate like i can


---------16:51----------
just think my way to enlightenment


---------16:52----------
absolutely my friend the path of


---------16:54----------
knowledge is for you


---------16:56----------
so you guys ready for your path of


---------16:58----------
knowledge


---------16:59----------
practice for


---------17:00----------
if you have an early life crisis and


---------17:02----------
you're avoiding conflict and don't want


---------17:03----------
to admit to yourself that your life is


---------17:05----------
empty and on autopilot


---------17:08----------
here it is


---------17:09----------
the next time you go out to eat


---------17:12----------
when a waiter asks you


---------17:14----------
how is your food


---------17:16----------
complain that is the practice


---------17:19----------
say hey if there's anything wrong with


---------17:21----------
your food don't just like complain just


---------17:23----------
because there's anything you don't like


---------17:25----------
about your food it needs a little bit


---------17:26----------
more salt needs a little bit more sauce


---------17:28----------
has too much sauce just complain just be


---------17:31----------
like you know


---------17:32----------
it's not the best to be honest


---------17:34----------
if you don't think if you'd give it like


---------17:36----------
a seven out of ten tell them you know


---------17:37----------
i'd give it a seven out of ten i think i


---------17:39----------
need to do this this than this


---------17:40----------
do it politely don't be an [ __ ]


---------17:43----------
you know don't be a karen


---------17:45----------
just be honest


---------17:47----------
just tell them


---------17:48----------
honestly i'm a little bit disappointed


---------17:51----------
it's kind of undercooked in the middle


---------17:53----------
tell them


---------17:55----------
right be respectful be kind be


---------17:57----------
compassionate but be honest


---------18:01----------
and then that's where it's kind of like


---------18:04----------
yeah don't lie i'm not telling you guys


---------18:06----------
to lie i'm just saying if there's some


---------18:07----------
problem with your food just tell your


---------18:08----------
waiter


---------18:10----------
or waitress


---------18:12----------
right no it's not being a douchebag so


---------18:14----------
if you're disrespectful about it that's


---------18:16----------
being a douchebag if you blame the


---------18:18----------
waiter and be like


---------18:20----------
throw a temper tantrum


---------18:22----------
if you like no you if they ask you how's


---------18:24----------
your food just answer the question that


---------18:26----------
they asked you


---------18:27----------
right that's all i'm saying you should


---------18:28----------
do and if you like it then you can say


---------18:31----------
that too


---------18:32----------
just tell them honestly what you think


---------18:33----------
about the food


---------18:36----------
and now notice within yourself what


---------18:38----------
happens


---------18:40----------
when you start to do that


---------18:41----------
because what is this a practice of why


---------18:42----------
is this


---------18:43----------
why is this a meditation practice is dr


---------18:45----------
k just trying to make you feel


---------18:46----------
uncomfortable well yeah that's a little


---------18:48----------
bit of that


---------18:49----------
but what it really is is recognizing


---------18:51----------
when i feel something on the inside


---------18:54----------
and i hold it in for the sake of


---------18:57----------
disrupting other people's ruffling other


---------18:59----------
people's feathers that's how you get


---------19:01----------
into an early life crisis like this


---------19:04----------
because you're so conflict-avoided that


---------19:06----------
you can't even own something as simple


---------19:08----------
as my sandwich has too much tomato


---------19:13----------
you know like that's all


---------19:15----------
and so practice this is what nyani yogg


---------19:16----------
is what happens within you and then pay


---------19:19----------
attention what makes it hard to do what


---------19:21----------
makes it easy to do how is it received


---------19:23----------
by other people


---------19:25----------
can you vocalize what you truly feel


---------19:27----------
internally even if it sets someone up to


---------19:29----------
feel a little bit bad because here's the


---------19:31----------
really cool thing so if you guys are


---------19:33----------
afraid of making people feel bad you


---------19:35----------
know if you get something and it's not


---------19:36----------
what you if you really want to be nasty


---------19:38----------
about it if you want to be like


---------19:39----------
slytherin style then you can like when


---------19:41----------
they order something and then tell them


---------19:42----------
you ordered something else and like


---------19:44----------
that's lying though but you know i don't


---------19:46----------
think you should do something like that


---------19:48----------
but and because here's the cool thing is


---------19:50----------
like oftentimes chefs and waiters will


---------19:51----------
like want to fix it for you right


---------19:54----------
and so you let them fix it for you then


---------19:55----------
you can give them honest feedback you'd


---------19:56----------
be like hey this is so much better i


---------19:57----------
really appreciate it oh yeah just like


---------19:59----------
that side of sauce really fix things


---------20:02----------
can i get some ketchup oh the ketchup


---------20:03----------
actually fixes it thank you so much


---------20:06----------
right you can you can do you can be a


---------20:08----------
good person i'm not saying don't be a


---------20:10----------
good person you have to be an evil


---------20:11----------
person but be honest


---------20:13----------
this is


---------20:15----------
to be honest with the people around you


---------20:16----------
be authentic with yourself and do so in


---------20:18----------
a compassionate way and if you are so


---------20:20----------
it's so hard for you to do that because


---------20:22----------
then that's why we pick it right nyan


---------20:24----------
yoga is like


---------20:26----------
there's no you can't it's not as easy as


---------20:28----------
just sitting there and breathing so nyan


---------20:29----------
yoga is actually regarded as the hardest


---------20:32----------
path to enlightenment


---------20:35----------
and so there are a bunch of people out


---------20:36----------
there like you thinking oh i have such


---------20:37----------
high iq i can do path of knowledge easy


---------20:39----------
peasy no


---------20:41----------
it's the path of contemplation it's not


---------20:43----------
the path of information


---------20:45----------
not yan yoga is not gained just by


---------20:47----------
reading books it's gained by the


---------20:50----------
application of what you read into


---------20:52----------
like experiments on the self


---------20:56----------
so give it a shot there's your on your


---------20:58----------
practice okay


---------21:09----------
you
