---------00:00----------
blows my [ __ ] mind but meditation


---------00:02----------
literally protects you from heart


---------00:03----------
attacks literally physiologic mechanisms


---------00:07----------
it's like anyone a fourth-year medical


---------00:09----------
student if I took the time if we were


---------00:11----------
talking on chat I could walk a


---------00:13----------
fourth-year medical student through this


---------00:15----------
process it's not BS it's just literally


---------00:19----------
how our body works


---------00:25----------
as well learn something new we're doing


---------00:27----------
physical meditation dadbod or do you


---------00:32----------
guys want to do something a little bit


---------00:33----------
more mental how about I teach you guys


---------00:37----------
how to breathe okay so I'm gonna teach


---------00:45----------
you guys how to breathe so so thanks for


---------00:55----------
the sob gizmo so here's here's what


---------00:58----------
we're gonna do I want you guys to just


---------01:02----------
breathe in we're gonna start with


---------01:04----------
abdominal breathing so I want you to do


---------01:06----------
is try to hold your chest as steady as


---------01:09----------
possible and as you breathe in I want


---------01:12----------
you to push your stomach out and as you


---------01:16----------
breathe out I want you to pull pull your


---------01:19----------
stomach in and pull your navel towards


---------01:22----------
your spine sound on notifications is


---------01:27----------
very loud alert box okay I'll teach you


---------01:37----------
guys how to sit - we'll teach you how to


---------01:40----------
sit posture is easy so I want you guys


---------01:44----------
when you breathe out so I'm gonna stop


---------01:45----------
reading to it shut


---------01:46----------
so stop typing because if you're typing


---------01:49----------
you're probably not breathing so when


---------01:52----------
you breathe in let your navel come out


---------01:57----------
when you breathe out pull your stomach


---------01:59----------
in


---------02:12----------
now I want you guys to watch regular


---------02:15----------
breath so watch my shoulders


---------02:18----------
that's right dealer breath right you


---------02:22----------
guys see how much my chest and shoulders


---------02:24----------
are moving abdominal breath you guys got


---------02:37----------
that


---------02:38----------
so Valley comes out when you inhale and


---------02:42----------
belly moves back in when you exhale okay


---------02:52----------
so now we're gonna add the second phase


---------02:56----------
of what this practice is called


---------02:57----------
triphasic breathing so now when you're


---------03:00----------
fully inhaled with your belly then what


---------03:03----------
I want you to do is mindfully expand


---------03:06----------
your chest and then breathe more so


---------03:09----------
there's gonna be like a second phase you


---------03:19----------
guys feel that so valley first then


---------03:24----------
chest and what you'll find is that you


---------03:28----------
can actually breathe more than you can


---------03:31----------
with just your belly if you do the chest


---------03:34----------
breathing after so let's practice that


---------03:36----------
for three rounds


---------03:48----------
and then what we're gonna do the is the


---------03:51----------
final phase the third phase of triphasic


---------03:53----------
breathing which is gonna be you're gonna


---------03:55----------
raise your shoulders which is gonna be


---------03:57----------
clavicular breathing so you have three


---------03:59----------
areas which kind of control in the


---------04:02----------
expansion of your lungs your valley


---------04:05----------
which is your diaphragm your chest so


---------04:09----------
chest expansion is gonna be like your


---------04:10----------
your muscles around your rims and the


---------04:13----------
third area is actually your clavicles so


---------04:16----------
when you breathe in expand the chest and


---------04:20----------
then lift up your shoulders and you'll


---------04:23----------
be able to get just a little bit like


---------04:25----------
five percent more breath in and then do


---------04:28----------
each phase at a time so start with


---------04:30----------
abdomen chest clavicles abdomen chest


---------04:46----------
and clavicles if you feel dizzy take


---------04:59----------
breaks between your breaths dizziness is


---------05:03----------
from elevated co2 I mean a co2 that's


---------05:06----------
too long


---------05:16----------
if you're yawning that's fine just go


---------05:18----------
ahead and yawn don't suppress it and


---------05:20----------
then go back to the practice so now


---------05:22----------
close your eyes and do five rounds on


---------05:24----------
your own


---------05:26----------
start with the belly transition to the


---------05:29----------
chest raise the shoulders and then out


---------05:39----------
I'd say you should do this practice


---------05:41----------
before you charge your laser beams but


---------05:43----------
I'm going to stop talking for a minute


---------05:44----------
we're going to do five breaths


---------06:16----------
you


---------06:48----------
okay I'm going to answer a bunch of


---------06:53----------
questions that I see okay so the first


---------06:55----------
thing is can you change the way you


---------06:57----------
subconsciously breathe during the day


---------06:58----------
yes so if you practice breathing you'll


---------07:01----------
start to breathe less from the chest and


---------07:04----------
more from the abdomen you can train


---------07:06----------
yourself to breathe deeper you can train


---------07:08----------
yourself to breathe slower absolutely


---------07:10----------
second question domination time asks co2


---------07:13----------
to low it equals dizziness what about


---------07:16----------
co2 too high is that the same thing


---------07:26----------
absolutely not so spiritual experiences


---------07:30----------
in meditation are believed to be due to


---------07:33----------
sort of like toxic levels of co2 in the


---------07:37----------
brain so when you start to get a trippy


---------07:40----------
experience during meditation the most


---------07:43----------
prevailing or at least I think the best


---------07:45----------
neuroscience theory for why people feel


---------07:48----------
like an expansion of consciousness and


---------07:50----------
other things like that is is due to


---------07:55----------
elevated levels of co2 so what happens


---------07:58----------
when you meditate on a very regular


---------07:59----------
basis is your body acclimatize --is to


---------08:03----------
low levels of oxygen in high levels of


---------08:05----------
co2 and a very low respiratory rate okay


---------08:09----------
so if that means is that for a normal


---------08:12----------
human so I see someone understands


---------08:14----------
respiratory physiology and chat and says


---------08:17----------
co2 too high equals acidosis equals more


---------08:20----------
breathing yes that's the standard


---------08:22----------
physiologic response when your co2 is


---------08:25----------
elevated your brain tells you to breathe


---------08:28----------
more so that you can breathe off that


---------08:30----------
co2 the interesting thing is when you


---------08:33----------
meditate your body becomes acclimatized


---------08:36----------
to high levels of co2 to where it


---------08:38----------
recruits other kinds of mechanisms that


---------08:41----------
don't require rapid breathing and when


---------08:44----------
you meditate up for a very regular basis


---------08:47----------
you begin to have a very low respiratory


---------08:49----------
rate but it doesn't damage you you


---------08:51----------
shouldn't try to restrict your


---------08:52----------
respiratory rate it's just like when you


---------08:54----------
guys meditate like I don't know if you


---------08:56----------
guys realize this but your respiratory


---------08:57----------
rate is dropping right when you do like


---------09:00----------
triphasic Barre


---------09:01----------
like it's not hard to do like five


---------09:04----------
breaths a minute like it's really not


---------09:06----------
like each breath that was like a


---------09:18----------
15-second breath like maybe 12 or 15 and


---------09:22----------
so if I if it takes me if I breathe in


---------09:25----------
for seven seconds and breathe out for


---------09:26----------
seven seconds


---------09:27----------
that's a respiratory rate of four per


---------09:30----------
minute that's four breaths a minute


---------09:32----------
right which is like not that hard to do


---------09:35----------
I can tell you breathe in for seven


---------09:47----------
that's a 15-second breath so what


---------09:51----------
happens in meditation is that you your


---------09:53----------
body becomes acclimatize to high levels


---------09:55----------
of co2 in the brain and what people


---------09:58----------
believe is that when you have high


---------10:00----------
levels of co2 in the brain for prolonged


---------10:02----------
periods of time you actually start to


---------10:04----------
have like a trippy spiritual experience


---------10:07----------
the other thing that's really


---------10:10----------
fascinating is one of the ways through


---------10:11----------
which meditation protects you from heart


---------10:13----------
attacks is the other thing so it does a


---------10:16----------
question for chat does anyone know what


---------10:19----------
your heart does when it becomes starved


---------10:22----------
for oxygen who let's test people's


---------10:26----------
physiologic knowledge what is your heart


---------10:28----------
do when it it doesn't get enough oxygen


---------10:30----------
you guys know


---------10:31----------
[Music]


---------10:40----------
okay it dilates the coronary that's


---------10:44----------
correct


---------10:44----------
and what is the long-term effect of


---------10:47----------
chronic hypoxia on the heart


---------10:55----------
vasodilation is a temporary effect so it


---------11:03----------
sends signals to create collateral


---------11:06----------
circulation right so when you're when


---------11:08----------
your heart is starved for oxygen so this


---------11:10----------
is what happens in the heart as your


---------11:13----------
arteries get clogged the heart


---------11:16----------
angiogenesis that's correct so as your


---------11:19----------
heart as your arteries get clogged the


---------11:22----------
amount of space through which blood can


---------11:24----------
travel to nourish your heart goes down


---------11:26----------
as you get a blocked artery your heart


---------11:30----------
starts to become starved for oxygen as


---------11:33----------
it becomes starved for oxygen it does


---------11:36----------
two things it sends immediate signals to


---------11:39----------
dilate the artery so if we dilate the


---------11:41----------
artery we increase its it's like how


---------11:44----------
wide it is which facilitates more flow


---------11:47----------
the other thing that it does is sends


---------11:49----------
signals to create more blood vessels


---------11:52----------
angiogenesis right so when you meditate


---------11:58----------
for prolonged periods of time your


---------12:03----------
oxygen levels start to go lower but not


---------12:07----------
in a damaging way because it's like a


---------12:08----------
chronic thing your body acclimatize us


---------12:10----------
to it and it sends signals to your heart


---------12:13----------
to create collateral circulation which


---------12:16----------
in turn means that if you've got a


---------12:17----------
blocked coronary artery in your


---------12:19----------
irregular meditator the damage from that


---------12:21----------
coronary artery is going to be way less


---------12:24----------
because your body has developed


---------12:26----------
alternate paths of circulation through


---------12:28----------
meditation blows my [ __ ] mind


---------12:32----------
but meditation literally protects you


---------12:34----------
from heart attacks literally physiologic


---------12:37----------
mechanisms it's like anyone a


---------12:39----------
fourth-year medical student if I took


---------12:40----------
the time if we were talking on chat I


---------12:43----------
could walk a fourth-year medical student


---------12:45----------
through this process it's not BS


---------12:49----------
it's just literally how our body works


---------12:51----------
as our breathing rate goes down our


---------12:55----------
oxygen level goes down and you can't


---------12:59----------
normally meditate like for 20 minutes a


---------13:01----------
day until you get really good at it and


---------13:02----------
then like you have these stories of like


---------13:05----------
these Yogi's in the Himalayas that go


---------13:06----------
into like semi semi hibernation states


---------13:09----------
right and like I don't know if you guys


---------13:12----------
have heard about this stuff then you've


---------13:13----------
got other stuff like wim HOF who does


---------13:16----------
like you guys heard about wim HOF the


---------13:18----------
Iceman so this is a guy that like


---------13:21----------
learned this nepalese like this


---------13:23----------
Himalayan meditation technique which is


---------13:25----------
what they do to stay warm so you have


---------13:27----------
like these Yogi's that are living in the


---------13:28----------
Himalayas that are like not wearing


---------13:30----------
coats they just like hang out there in


---------13:33----------
like a simple shawl and the reason that


---------13:35----------
they can sustain that is because they do


---------13:37----------
bizarre things to their physiology and


---------13:39----------
like wim HOF is a guy who learned this


---------13:42----------
stuff and then it has like all these


---------13:44----------
like like physiologists like testing him


---------13:46----------
they stick him in like sub sub-zero like


---------13:49----------
temperatures and he like doesn't get


---------13:52----------
frostbite or die he just is fine


---------13:54----------
so like meditation has a lot of profound


---------13:58----------
impacts on the human body okay so we've


---------14:05----------
got a couple of other questions so let


---------14:07----------
me just get to these okay so Tom you


---------14:13----------
shouldn't be anteriorly translating your


---------14:15----------
t3 t4 vertebra your clavicles should be


---------14:18----------
going up not forward if that makes sense


---------14:36----------
okay so people are asking questions


---------14:38----------
about when I try to made it say I worry


---------14:41----------
a lot about it not going as well as it


---------14:42----------
went before that makes it very hard to


---------14:44----------
clear my mind any advice congratulations


---------14:46----------
Matt the Strummer also asked is it


---------14:49----------
normal for meditation to go really well


---------14:50----------
at first but then get more difficult


---------14:53----------
after a while absolutely so the tricky


---------14:58----------
thing about meditation is the way that


---------15:01----------
you enter the know mind state of


---------15:03----------
meditation is by having no expectations


---------15:06----------
right so like the first time if you guys


---------15:09----------
were around for charging the laser beam


---------15:10----------
technique we did a meditation technique


---------15:13----------
and I ask people what does it feel like


---------15:14----------
and one person to chat literally said it


---------15:17----------
feels like I'm charging a laser beam and


---------15:19----------
the cool thing is like when I don't tell


---------15:21----------
you what to expect your mind cannot have


---------15:25----------
an expectation and therefore you could


---------15:27----------
sit fully with the experience once you


---------15:30----------
sit with an experience and you feel like


---------15:33----------
you have some kind of experience in


---------15:34----------
meditation then that creates an


---------15:37----------
expectation to have that experience


---------15:39----------
again and that expectation makes it hard


---------15:43----------
to meditate so the most difficult


---------15:46----------
spiritual experience to have in


---------15:49----------
meditation is the second one not the


---------15:51----------
first one the first one is actually easy


---------15:53----------
and then once you start expecting then


---------15:58----------
it becomes hard because then you're


---------16:00----------
attached to that meditation then you


---------16:02----------
create the thought oh this isn't working


---------16:03----------
it's not I'm not feeling the way that I


---------16:06----------
used to feel it's not working the way


---------16:08----------
that it used to this isn't working


---------16:10----------
that's what you tell yourself when you


---------16:11----------
meditate and that thought in and of


---------16:14----------
itself is why you don't get into


---------16:16----------
meditation the state of meditation so is


---------16:19----------
it hard for it to happen is it hard for


---------16:22----------
like you to do it after a while


---------16:23----------
absolutely that's the most common


---------16:26----------
challenge in meditation and the cool


---------16:28----------
thing is once you recognize that okay


---------16:31----------
the reason I'm not able to meditate is


---------16:33----------
because I'm trying to meditate and the


---------16:35----------
reason I'm trying to meditate is because


---------16:37----------
now I understand what meditation is


---------16:38----------
because I did it before


---------16:41----------
that's a bizarre and paradoxical and


---------16:43----------
wonderful hilarious challenge and so I


---------16:48----------
would say like Matt and this person who


---------16:50----------
asked this question is it hard


---------16:51----------
absolutely just recognize that recognize


---------16:54----------
that for some time it's gonna be harder


---------16:56----------
for me to get that meditation going


---------16:59----------
again and then also to return to the


---------17:02----------
technique so your thought is you're


---------17:03----------
gonna have all these thoughts right


---------17:04----------
you're gonna be like oh it's not working


---------17:05----------
it's not working just go back to the


---------17:07----------
technique just focus on your breath


---------17:08----------
ignore whether it's working stop trying


---------17:10----------
to make it work if it's working that's


---------17:13----------
fine if it's not working that's fine to


---------17:16----------
just focus on the technique just focus


---------17:19----------
on the technique focus on the technique


---------17:20----------
focus on the technique the more you


---------17:22----------
focus on the technique that's what got


---------17:24----------
you there in the first place that's what


---------17:25----------
will get you there again
