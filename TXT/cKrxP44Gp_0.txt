---------00:00----------
if you don't accept yourself as a trans


---------00:02----------
woman


---------00:04----------
you are placing a value on cis women


---------00:07----------
over trans women


---------00:08----------
oh 100 yeah right and so that's i think


---------00:11----------
the basic problem is that like you are


---------00:13----------
valuing something above yourself that


---------00:16----------
you will never be


---------00:22----------
yeah so welcome and you go by natalie is


---------00:25----------
that right


---------00:26----------
natalie yeah okay so i'm all oak or dr k


---------00:29----------
thank you very much for coming today um


---------00:32----------
nice to meet you


---------00:33----------
i really love your so let's start sorry


---------00:37----------
i'm just


---------00:38----------
fixing my camera which is why


---------00:42----------
so uh do you want to just start because


---------00:43----------
i i know you're predominantly on youtube


---------00:45----------
or exclusively on youtube


---------00:47----------
do you want to just tell us a little bit


---------00:48----------
about who you are natalie and and what


---------00:50----------
kind of work you do


---------00:52----------
uh sure yeah my name is natalie wynn


---------00:56----------
i am the creator of the youtube channel


---------00:57----------
contra points


---------00:59----------
and that is a channel i've been doing


---------01:01----------
for about four years


---------01:03----------
it's changed a lot over the time i've


---------01:05----------
been doing it


---------01:06----------
and it is i would say


---------01:10----------
it's about politics but it's also


---------01:13----------
i guess more generally about internet


---------01:15----------
culture


---------01:16----------
it's more about the internet culture


---------01:18----------
side of politics


---------01:19----------
so when i started on youtube i was kind


---------01:22----------
of


---------01:23----------
well there's a lot of creators who are


---------01:25----------
doing what was called like


---------01:27----------
anti-sjw content uh


---------01:29----------
anti-social justice warrior content


---------01:31----------
ranting about these crazy blue haired


---------01:33----------
student activists who are destroying


---------01:34----------
western civilization


---------01:36----------
and a lot of my early content was aimed


---------01:39----------
at trying to like


---------01:41----------
introduce a more measured discourse


---------01:43----------
around like


---------01:44----------
social justice issues progressive issues


---------01:47----------
because i felt that youtube was a


---------01:49----------
very very right wing


---------01:52----------
things that the world has changed a lot


---------01:54----------
in four years the internet's changed a


---------01:56----------
lot youtube's changed a lot and i have


---------01:58----------
changed a lot


---------01:59----------
um i am in a different way


---------02:03----------
it's a whole different website a whole


---------02:04----------
different world now um


---------02:06----------
you know i'm now just one among a sea


---------02:09----------
of people who's doing sort of what they


---------02:12----------
call a left


---------02:12----------
to the content now and i also


---------02:16----------
have uh you know changed


---------02:19----------
genders in that time because i started


---------02:24----------
uh you know when i started in 2016 i was


---------02:26----------
having


---------02:27----------
like a kind of gender crisis um


---------02:30----------
but i shortly realized that i was a


---------02:33----------
trans woman and i've


---------02:34----------
been transitioning medically and


---------02:36----------
socially since 2017


---------02:39----------
and all of that's kind of factored into


---------02:41----------
the content that i make on youtube


---------02:43----------
interesting um thank you so much for


---------02:46----------
sharing that so


---------02:47----------
like i think your videos are fantastic


---------02:51----------
and i don't know if you have um


---------02:53----------
experience teaching


---------02:55----------
but like they're very well done i think


---------02:58----------
from a


---------02:58----------
information dissemination standpoint i


---------03:00----------
think you're a phenomenal teacher


---------03:02----------
thank you i am before i did this i was a


---------03:06----------
i was i was getting a phd in philosophy


---------03:10----------
and dropped out but


---------03:13----------
um yeah i did teach a couple classes or


---------03:15----------
at least take tas and classes


---------03:17----------
that actually makes a lot of sense now


---------03:19----------
that i think about it because i think


---------03:21----------
what i really appreciate about your


---------03:22----------
videos is um you know whether you


---------03:25----------
agree or disagree with the content


---------03:26----------
whatever but i think from a


---------03:29----------
craftsmanship standpoint they're very


---------03:31----------
thoughtful very logical


---------03:32----------
i think you form a really good like


---------03:35----------
sequence of explaining context and


---------03:37----------
background before


---------03:38----------
you know arriving at your thesis it


---------03:40----------
doesn't surprise me at all that you


---------03:41----------
formally studied philosophy because i


---------03:43----------
think that's a


---------03:43----------
you know they trained you how to think


---------03:45----------
and construct an argument more than


---------03:46----------
anything else


---------03:48----------
um thank you yeah it turned out to be


---------03:50----------
well and on you like no one expects to


---------03:52----------
get a philosophy drop outside of


---------03:53----------
academia but


---------03:55----------
i found the one thing where it actually


---------03:58----------
i'm sure it's useful for a lot of things


---------04:00----------
but it's pretty surprising


---------04:01----------
actually specifically useful for this


---------04:03----------
yeah um in


---------04:04----------
in some fields like strategic consulting


---------04:06----------
they actually highly prioritize or


---------04:08----------
highly value philosophy degrees


---------04:10----------
because training and philosophy is


---------04:12----------
sometimes training and thinking


---------04:15----------
yeah it teaches you a certain approach


---------04:17----------
to to things like


---------04:18----------
the ability to sort of understand a


---------04:20----------
perspective that you disagree with


---------04:22----------
or to like build up arguments for an


---------04:25----------
argument that you disagree with


---------04:26----------
and then like sort of counter it it's a


---------04:29----------
kind of like i guess i call it like


---------04:30----------
intellectual empathy where you


---------04:33----------
understand like why you try to


---------04:34----------
understand


---------04:35----------
what exactly someone else thinks and why


---------04:38----------
they think it


---------04:39----------
that's maybe the more psychological side


---------04:40----------
is why i was going to say that sounds


---------04:42----------
like my job


---------04:44----------
yeah yes that's definitely


---------04:47----------
definitely more in psychology so natalie


---------04:49----------
i don't know how familiar you are with


---------04:51----------
healthy gamer but if i can just orient


---------04:52----------
you to how we do interviews


---------04:55----------
um so you know we usually don't we'll


---------04:57----------
have guests who


---------04:58----------
may be like you know prominent in a


---------05:01----------
particular field but


---------05:02----------
we don't really talk about


---------05:05----------
the work that they do so it's not like


---------05:08----------
you know we're really here to learn


---------05:09----------
about


---------05:10----------
people yeah sure and and i think so


---------05:14----------
often times i'll i'll ask questions that


---------05:16----------
are like personal so like i want to know


---------05:17----------
about you as a person in your journey


---------05:19----------
as opposed to any particular political


---------05:21----------
views that you may believe in or


---------05:23----------
whatever


---------05:23----------
yeah yeah and you know if if a political


---------05:27----------
view that you


---------05:28----------
have relates to something personal in


---------05:30----------
your life i think that's actually like


---------05:33----------
totally cool um but generally speaking


---------05:35----------
you know we we talk about people and i


---------05:37----------
think a lot of


---------05:38----------
what uh our viewers really appreciate is


---------05:41----------
um seeing themselves in the person that


---------05:44----------
they're talking to so the the


---------05:45----------
discussions tend to be a little bit more


---------05:47----------
personal


---------05:48----------
sure that being said you know if there


---------05:50----------
is anything that


---------05:51----------
um you're welcome to draw whatever


---------05:55----------
boundaries you want around the


---------05:56----------
discussion


---------05:57----------
i'm not here to try to expose anything


---------05:59----------
or anything like that


---------06:00----------
um you know like if there's something


---------06:02----------
that you feel uncomfortable with


---------06:04----------
you're welcome to say hey i just don't


---------06:05----------
want to answer that um


---------06:07----------
and then if i notice you're getting


---------06:09----------
uncomfortable i may actually point it


---------06:11----------
out to you


---------06:12----------
and then ask for permission to proceed


---------06:14----------
okay sounds good


---------06:16----------
i mean i'm a habitual divulger of


---------06:18----------
information about myself


---------06:20----------
so that's probably going to work out


---------06:22----------
fine what does that mean a habitual


---------06:24----------
divulger of information about you well i


---------06:26----------
i it means i enjoy the confession


---------06:29----------
the confessional format i i mean


---------06:32----------
every once every every couple you know


---------06:35----------
twice a year maybe i make a video that's


---------06:36----------
really more about me than about anything


---------06:38----------
else


---------06:39----------
what do you enjoy about divulging


---------06:41----------
information about yourself


---------06:44----------
well i i suppose i'm interested in


---------06:47----------
myself


---------06:48----------
because i around to this person all the


---------06:51----------
time and sometimes i


---------06:52----------
form opinions i i guess i i don't know


---------06:55----------
it's


---------06:56----------
it feels there's also maybe a kind of


---------06:59----------
there's probably some kind of


---------07:01----------
therapeutic thing for me it feels good


---------07:02----------
to sort of


---------07:04----------
speak your truth as it were i don't know


---------07:07----------
i i cannot it can also be sort of i


---------07:10----------
think it can be unhealthy just


---------07:12----------
sometimes when you're kind i don't know


---------07:14----------
if


---------07:15----------
for instance i find it easier sometimes


---------07:17----------
to talk to a million people than to talk


---------07:19----------
to one person


---------07:21----------
in that i think especially online


---------07:24----------
there's a kind of when you're producing


---------07:26----------
you know i'm sure people can relate to


---------07:28----------
this when you're posting anything on


---------07:29----------
social media


---------07:30----------
there's a kind of illusion of of


---------07:33----------
solitude


---------07:34----------
that comes from being alone at your


---------07:36----------
computer


---------07:38----------
um i often are you know alone in front


---------07:40----------
of the camera


---------07:42----------
which is often how i'm filming right and


---------07:44----------
how i'm writing


---------07:46----------
and so i've i'm sort of gotten over this


---------07:49----------
i'm


---------07:49----------
becoming more a professional but there


---------07:52----------
used to be a time when i would um


---------07:54----------
you know the first time that i would see


---------07:57----------
the video i had just spent 100 hours


---------07:59----------
making in the youtube player itself


---------08:03----------
i would have this moment of panic like


---------08:04----------
oh god like other people can actually


---------08:06----------
see this


---------08:08----------
like this is not just my private video


---------08:10----------
diary that i've been working


---------08:12----------
on um but i don't know i guess it feels


---------08:15----------
good to sort of like share what you're


---------08:16----------
going through and oftentimes


---------08:19----------
you know a bunch of other people will


---------08:22----------
find


---------08:23----------
something relevant to themselves about


---------08:25----------
what you've shared


---------08:26----------
and so that to me is very um


---------08:29----------
[Music]


---------08:31----------
well it often it makes you feel less


---------08:32----------
alone you know when you hear that other


---------08:35----------
people have been through


---------08:36----------
something similar and that's actually


---------08:38----------
exactly what we're about we're about


---------08:40----------
you know i think a lot of the it's the


---------08:43----------
reason i started streaming was because


---------08:45----------
what i noticed is i was having the same


---------08:47----------
conversations like over and over and


---------08:49----------
over again


---------08:50----------
and everyone thought that they were


---------08:51----------
alone with their struggles


---------08:53----------
yeah and what it turns out is that


---------08:56----------
everyone is struggling with the same


---------08:57----------
stuff it's just


---------08:58----------
that's not what we advertise right we we


---------09:01----------
put on a mask and we show people


---------09:03----------
something else


---------09:04----------
and so everyone else gets the impression


---------09:06----------
that the world is like a lot of people


---------09:08----------
who are doing fantastic


---------09:10----------
whereas all of us are struggling yeah


---------09:14----------
and so well i think there's a using a


---------09:16----------
leap of faith almost that happens


---------09:18----------
when you put out something very personal


---------09:21----------
because


---------09:23----------
you're you know maybe everyone thinks


---------09:25----------
you're crazy


---------09:27----------
um or maybe and this is a leap of faith


---------09:31----------
the fact that you're going through


---------09:32----------
something in private that's not often


---------09:34----------
discussed


---------09:35----------
it's going to turn it's going to turn


---------09:36----------
out that you know 10 000 other people


---------09:38----------
are going through that same thing


---------09:40----------
and they all connect with you so so


---------09:42----------
you're sort of hoping


---------09:43----------
or even if they're not going through


---------09:44----------
exactly what you're going through


---------09:46----------
it relates in some way to their own


---------09:48----------
experience and so you're hoping they


---------09:50----------
connect on on some level


---------09:52----------
yeah so can you share with us is there


---------09:54----------
has there been a particular leap of


---------09:56----------
faith that you've taken that's


---------09:58----------
surprised you in terms of how people


---------10:01----------
responded to it


---------10:04----------
let's see uh yeah there's been a few


---------10:08----------
um trying to think of a


---------10:12----------
like the best example well i


---------10:15----------
did a video a long time ago on


---------10:18----------
in cells the insult movement and


---------10:22----------
i kind of in the last part of that video


---------10:26----------
related because that you know i spent a


---------10:29----------
lot of time on insult forms like


---------10:31----------
when i part of what i do when i cover a


---------10:33----------
um


---------10:34----------
like an intern you know some facet of


---------10:37----------
internet culture


---------10:38----------
because i would go into the forums and


---------10:40----------
i'll like sort of spend time


---------10:41----------
learning the vocabulary and learning


---------10:43----------
like what are the concerns how


---------10:45----------
you know what are the what are the usual


---------10:47----------
objections that people give


---------10:48----------
to you know to insults that they've


---------10:50----------
heard a hundred times and are just


---------10:51----------
already don't want to hear um you know


---------10:55----------
and so i guess what i found is that like


---------10:57----------
there's something kind of profoundly


---------10:59----------
i guess relatable to me about


---------11:02----------
that like obsessive like self abuse


---------11:06----------
that a lot of like in cells have right


---------11:09----------
this kind of putting themselves down all


---------11:11----------
the time and


---------11:12----------
to the point of like physiologically


---------11:15----------
like anatomically analyzing their


---------11:17----------
defects in great detail


---------11:20----------
and that it reminded me i guess of um


---------11:23----------
a lot of like the uglier trans faces


---------11:27----------
online


---------11:28----------
which in a different you know this kind


---------11:30----------
of different context


---------11:31----------
involve exactly the same thing which is


---------11:34----------
like a kind of


---------11:35----------
an obsessively negative self-harming


---------11:39----------
like analysis of your own anatomy


---------11:42----------
right uh the black pill


---------11:46----------
right the the that's what cells call it


---------11:48----------
the idea that


---------11:49----------
you know because of their you know


---------11:51----------
inferior bone structure


---------11:54----------
that they are doomed by nature to have


---------11:57----------
a lonely life but yeah


---------12:01----------
yeah and and so you said that that you


---------12:03----------
said it sort of resonated with you on


---------12:05----------
on some level or it was it did yeah yeah


---------12:09----------
i found something familiar about it um


---------12:12----------
you know write down it's through some


---------12:14----------
weird weirdly specific parallels are you


---------12:16----------
concerned about the shapes of facial


---------12:18----------
bones


---------12:20----------
and can you do you mind if i ask you a


---------12:22----------
little bit more like personally about


---------12:24----------
what it was that resonated with you or


---------12:26----------
what kinds of thoughts that you've had


---------12:28----------
about yourself i'm assuming you're


---------12:31----------
thinking about yourself


---------12:32----------
absolutely i mean at the time i was


---------12:34----------
actually considering


---------12:36----------
going through like a major facial


---------12:38----------
surgery


---------12:39----------
um to change my appearance which i ended


---------12:42----------
up doing


---------12:43----------
um but it's it's funnily enough it's


---------12:46----------
actually


---------12:47----------
a frequent topic on insult forms too


---------12:49----------
where they'll talk about


---------12:50----------
basically doing all the opposite things


---------12:52----------
of what i did you know


---------12:54----------
augmenting the jaw and to get a stronger


---------12:58----------
more masculine look


---------12:59----------
and uh you know strengthening the brow


---------13:02----------
bone and


---------13:03----------
doing all these things that give them


---------13:05----------
that like chiseled


---------13:07----------
chadley appearance and and so what is it


---------13:10----------
that


---------13:10----------
how does changing your physical


---------13:13----------
appearance


---------13:15----------
how does that relate to the way that you


---------13:17----------
perceive or feel or talk


---------13:19----------
talk to yourself like how do you like


---------13:22----------
you know what


---------13:23----------
what help what motivates you to do that


---------13:25----------
and what does it mean to you to do that


---------13:28----------
well i think it's something that most


---------13:30----------
people do to some extent


---------13:32----------
like i think everyone has everyone with


---------13:35----------
a mirror


---------13:36----------
has some kind of thing about themselves


---------13:39----------
they don't like


---------13:40----------
i think that when you're trans like i am


---------13:43----------
like there's an additional layer of it


---------13:46----------
whereas i mean you like


---------13:48----------
i went through a period where like i


---------13:49----------
mean i was presenting


---------13:51----------
appearing to the world as a as a man and


---------13:54----------
that's how like there's a very that's a


---------13:57----------
very


---------13:58----------
drastic sense of what i'm saying in the


---------14:00----------
mirror


---------14:01----------
is wrong um and i think that


---------14:04----------
you know i think that's not as you know


---------14:08----------
it's a complicated question isn't it


---------14:10----------
like how much


---------14:11----------
of that dysphoria gender dysphoria


---------14:15----------
how much of that is just what it means


---------14:17----------
to be trans as part of who we are has to


---------14:19----------
be respected


---------14:20----------
and how much of it is a kind of


---------14:24----------
negative like internalized hatred


---------14:27----------
because society views trans people with


---------14:29----------
a very cruel gaze


---------14:32----------
and sometimes it's not clear like what


---------14:34----------
is gender dysphoria


---------14:36----------
and what is just me internalizing this


---------14:38----------
kind of


---------14:39----------
ugly way that people have looking at


---------14:41----------
trans people


---------14:42----------
so natalie do you mind if i ask you some


---------14:44----------
questions about like


---------14:45----------
what your sense of like kind of where


---------14:48----------
you grew


---------14:49----------
up i mean not so much in terms of


---------14:50----------
details about where but like what


---------14:52----------
your upbringing was like and and how you


---------14:55----------
learned that you were trans


---------14:58----------
yeah i can talk about that a little bit


---------15:01----------
i mean


---------15:01----------
i had um i guess it was such as an early


---------15:05----------
in my early childhood i had a pretty


---------15:08----------
a pretty normal boyhood in a way like


---------15:11----------
it's actually i don't think


---------15:13----------
like pre-12 years old i actually look


---------15:16----------
back on that time


---------15:17----------
mostly with with positivity i think that


---------15:20----------
you know


---------15:21----------
i i was sort of neither the most


---------15:25----------
i was certainly not the most masculine


---------15:26----------
boy but i was not like


---------15:28----------
i wasn't feminine to the point where it


---------15:29----------
was a major problem


---------15:31----------
um but when i was a teenager i guess


---------15:34----------
i sort of began there was this like


---------15:37----------
discontent


---------15:38----------
beginning to stir the senses something


---------15:40----------
was wrong


---------15:42----------
um in my 20s it just got worse


---------15:46----------
and worse can you explain that feeling


---------15:50----------
um like how would it make


---------15:53----------
i'm just imagining that there's like


---------15:55----------
someone who's 19 who's watching right


---------15:57----------
now


---------15:58----------
and how would they know you know


---------16:01----------
yeah how would you know you're trans


---------16:02----------
that's the question i get a lot


---------16:04----------
um well it gets a lot of trans people


---------16:07----------
will tell you that it's it's easy like


---------16:08----------
oh if you're even questioning at all


---------16:10----------
that means you're trans i don't agree


---------16:11----------
with that


---------16:12----------
i think that a lot of people question


---------16:14----------
their gender for a lot of


---------16:15----------
reasons um and i think


---------16:19----------
that you know whether you're raised as a


---------16:22----------
boy or as a girl like there's a lot of


---------16:24----------
like gendered expectations


---------16:26----------
put on to you there's a lot of um you


---------16:28----------
know


---------16:29----------
there's a kind of image of you know what


---------16:32----------
what you're supposed to be doing a


---------16:34----------
script


---------16:34----------
that you're supposed to be following and


---------16:36----------
it's it's everyone to some extent i


---------16:39----------
think


---------16:39----------
questions that a little bit about


---------16:41----------
themselves like i think this


---------16:43----------
that may be especially true of of women


---------16:45----------
people who are raised girls like


---------16:47----------
that's a very constrict well well it's


---------16:50----------
i think it's true with men in a


---------16:51----------
different way but it's um


---------16:53----------
you know that there's often times like


---------16:56----------
going to be


---------16:56----------
situations where you know even if you


---------16:59----------
are


---------16:59----------
just a you know a regular cis woman like


---------17:02----------
you're going to think like


---------17:03----------
this sucks i don't like being treated


---------17:05----------
like a woman because it sucks


---------17:07----------
right right and there's times when you


---------17:09----------
know when it sucks to be a man


---------17:11----------
like it's absolutely it does um but so


---------17:14----------
to me it's a question of


---------17:16----------
figuring out like not just whether


---------17:18----------
you're responding to those things but


---------17:21----------
in my case it's more a question of you


---------17:24----------
know


---------17:25----------
i just don't i feel like socially


---------17:28----------
i sort of fit a script for women better


---------17:33----------
and physically i'm so i have this kind


---------17:35----------
of


---------17:36----------
this sense of alienation from my body


---------17:39----------
that is making it hard for me


---------17:43----------
to like it's it's


---------17:46----------
you i feel i felt sort of feel like i


---------17:48----------
had to be detached from my body or go


---------17:50----------
outside of my body


---------17:51----------
i didn't feel sort of physically


---------17:53----------
connected to the world


---------17:55----------
and i you know people who are


---------17:58----------
trans women who are sort of not aware


---------18:00----------
that they're trans yet tend to do a lot


---------18:02----------
of


---------18:02----------
things that they can't quite explain to


---------18:04----------
themselves like like


---------18:06----------
an atypical forum for man amount of body


---------18:10----------
shaping


---------18:11----------
and uh or that kind of thing just kind


---------18:14----------
of trying to have a more androgynous


---------18:16----------
look i guess was something that i'd been


---------18:18----------
doing for a long time


---------18:19----------
and then you know i i would kind of like


---------18:23----------
as a joke you know it's halloween


---------18:27----------
well what if i would have fighted it was


---------18:30----------
a girl


---------18:30----------
wasn't that funny


---------18:34----------
you know and that kind of thing and at


---------18:36----------
some point you know


---------18:38----------
you you realize that like it took me a


---------18:40----------
long time honestly


---------18:41----------
there was a lot of denial and excuse


---------18:44----------
making


---------18:45----------
but i think you know youtube in some


---------18:47----------
ways helped me


---------18:48----------
help me figure it out as i was kind of


---------18:50----------
presenting


---------18:51----------
um you know at the time i was it was


---------18:53----------
played off as like


---------18:55----------
a bit where i was like going to be the


---------18:58----------
a degenerate cross-dresser that was just


---------19:01----------
the idea


---------19:01----------
the stick but so it looks like you used


---------19:04----------
a lot of humor


---------19:05----------
and yeah which is um


---------19:09----------
it's kind of what you because you i was


---------19:11----------
sort of aware that like


---------19:12----------
you know like i knew that i didn't look


---------19:14----------
like a woman like i i looked like a man


---------19:16----------
in a dress and people think


---------19:17----------
that's the thing that people find funny


---------19:20----------
so i guess


---------19:21----------
my way of coping with that was to be


---------19:22----------
like well i guess it is kind of funny


---------19:24----------
let's make it funny and so i did that


---------19:28----------
but at some point i kind of realized


---------19:29----------
like this is actually is not funny to me


---------19:32----------
it's like like this is what i want to be


---------19:35----------
and


---------19:36----------
i don't want you know i actually


---------19:39----------
i i feel like i'd rather live as a woman


---------19:42----------
um and that you know when i when i


---------19:45----------
realized that there was a kind of period


---------19:47----------
where i was going back and forth in the


---------19:48----------
meaning now that's because insanity


---------19:50----------
don't do that


---------19:50----------
and then times when i was being like


---------19:52----------
okay but it's what i want


---------19:54----------
and you know through through


---------19:57----------
the warriors through stages like for a


---------19:59----------
while i just identified as a


---------20:01----------
gender queer meaning that i sort of


---------20:03----------
identify with neither gender


---------20:05----------
i thought of myself as just like an


---------20:07----------
androgynous person


---------20:09----------
and so i would wear you know i was i was


---------20:12----------
like freaking biggie was looking like


---------20:13----------
i'd be wearing


---------20:14----------
nail polish and lipstick but like still


---------20:17----------
being


---------20:17----------
like socially like being a man i guess


---------20:20----------
uh


---------20:21----------
using a male name and things but just


---------20:23----------
being a sort of


---------20:24----------
uh i don't know flamboyant or um


---------20:31----------
how what is the word i'm looking for


---------20:33----------
like uh adorned man


---------20:35----------
but i guess um you know i just


---------20:38----------
at a certain point i realized that i


---------20:40----------
wanted to there was like a medical


---------20:42----------
component to this


---------20:44----------
you know i thought that i was uh well i


---------20:46----------
felt that like


---------20:47----------
there was a problem not just it's a


---------20:49----------
certain point it's not just about oh


---------20:51----------
i painted my nails so lots of men paint


---------20:53----------
their nails that's fine


---------20:54----------
right i wore a dress well men wear


---------20:57----------
dresses all the time


---------20:58----------
like but at a certain point i was like


---------21:00----------
but like this is like


---------21:01----------
this is not what i want to be i don't


---------21:02----------
want to be a man on a dress i'm like


---------21:05----------
i think i'm supposed to be a woman and


---------21:08----------
uh that then you know i i it was always


---------21:11----------
it was


---------21:11----------
all very gradual i kind of stumbled into


---------21:14----------
it like something i don't know the


---------21:15----------
different trans people have different


---------21:16----------
stories


---------21:17----------
some trans people that they know from


---------21:18----------
the age of three they just have this


---------21:20----------
strong inner conviction their different


---------21:22----------
gender


---------21:23----------
that's not really my story to me it was


---------21:25----------
it was more just like a series of the


---------21:27----------
gender problems and gender confusion


---------21:30----------
that just kind of settled on this


---------21:32----------
natalie how


---------21:33----------
how has your internal experience or


---------21:36----------
how have your feelings changed or your


---------21:38----------
thoughts changed


---------21:40----------
as you've walked along that journey so


---------21:43----------
i'm imagining


---------21:44----------
i'm trying to envision like when you


---------21:45----------
were 16 years old and you looked in the


---------21:47----------
mirror like


---------21:48----------
how did you feel about yourself and what


---------21:49----------
did you think about yourself


---------21:52----------
um well i think when i was very young


---------21:55----------
like that


---------21:56----------
i kind of like found a way of expressing


---------22:00----------
these feelings through like


---------22:03----------
just being a pretty boy you know and


---------22:05----------
like i was like well that's fine like


---------22:07----------
that's kind of me


---------22:08----------
you know um but i guess that's really


---------22:12----------
hard i think one thing that happened is


---------22:14----------
when i got a bit older like


---------22:16----------
that occupying like that kind of role


---------22:19----------
you know


---------22:20----------
at some point like can you be a 40 year


---------22:21----------
old pretty boy like


---------22:23----------
i don't know maybe maybe you can like


---------22:26----------
i'm sure i'm sure that there's there's


---------22:27----------
there's


---------22:27----------
hollywood actors and stuff out there who


---------22:30----------
i would describe that way


---------22:31----------
but i i guess i kind of realized like


---------22:35----------
you know being a boy was okay


---------22:38----------
but being a man wasn't if that makes


---------22:41----------
sense


---------22:42----------
sure yeah i mean i think you know


---------22:45----------
boys and girls and men and women i think


---------22:47----------
there's more


---------22:49----------
um you know androgyny between boys and


---------22:51----------
girls


---------22:52----------
exactly exactly and so i that's kind of


---------22:56----------
how i see myself like


---------22:57----------
as i can perceive myself kind of


---------22:59----------
becoming a man


---------23:01----------
that really like triggered the sense of


---------23:05----------
dread


---------23:05----------
and feeling of wrongness like no like


---------23:07----------
i'm not supposed to be that


---------23:09----------
um and so i think that


---------23:12----------
i also around this time like you know i


---------23:15----------
was not raised with


---------23:16----------
a knowledge of trans people not in any


---------23:18----------
detail


---------23:19----------
um certainly not in a very positive um


---------23:23----------
you know what have you dread about being


---------23:25----------
a man i guess i sort of


---------23:27----------
felt like


---------23:30----------
i felt that it wasn't an expression of


---------23:32----------
myself


---------23:34----------
and that's if you're i know that's


---------23:36----------
that's kind of fake that i feel like i'm


---------23:38----------
not


---------23:38----------
making it clear it's the kind of feeling


---------23:40----------
that's hard to put into words


---------23:42----------
it's like i just i would just


---------23:50----------
look at women and see like nothing like


---------23:53----------
that's what i should be doing


---------23:54----------
you know like i i sort of it's a matter


---------23:57----------
of um


---------23:58----------
at a certain point kind of like


---------23:59----------
identification like i think that


---------24:02----------
most people get their idea of what it


---------24:05----------
means to be a man or what it means to be


---------24:06----------
a woman


---------24:07----------
from other men and women like you sort


---------24:10----------
of form


---------24:11----------
role models i guess you have like sort


---------24:13----------
of


---------24:14----------
a verb i mean trans people and and cis


---------24:18----------
people are


---------24:18----------
are similar in a lot of ways like like


---------24:21----------
we all


---------24:22----------
you know have some way a version of our


---------24:25----------
gender that's like


---------24:26----------
we feel like that's us you know and


---------24:28----------
obviously there's a lot of different


---------24:30----------
ways of being a man there's a lot of


---------24:32----------
different ways of being a woman


---------24:34----------
but um i guess


---------24:39----------
you know and i think when you're an


---------24:41----------
adolescent especially you're kind of


---------24:43----------
experimenting with different options


---------24:45----------
like you might sort of try to be six


---------24:48----------
different people


---------24:49----------
between ages 13 and 18. that's pretty


---------24:51----------
common


---------24:52----------
but um like what happens when you start


---------24:55----------
admiring


---------24:57----------
the you start seeing yourself in women


---------25:00----------
and not in men that's a great way to put


---------25:02----------
it yeah


---------25:04----------
um so i i guess what you identify with


---------25:07----------
or what you


---------25:09----------
strive to be or the kinds of role models


---------25:11----------
you have


---------25:12----------
happen to be not from your gender


---------25:16----------
yeah yeah it reminds me of you know


---------25:19----------
people say


---------25:20----------
um when i was in med school and trying


---------25:22----------
to figure out what i wanted to do


---------25:26----------
what people told me was like you know


---------25:28----------
don't worry about the field


---------25:30----------
like think about the kinds of doctors


---------25:32----------
that feel like role models to you


---------25:34----------
yeah yeah you know and and so i'm kind


---------25:37----------
of curious


---------25:38----------
you know going through surgery um


---------25:42----------
i'm trying to find the right word for it


---------25:43----------
i i feel like drastic


---------25:45----------
is a little bit judgmental so i'm trying


---------25:47----------
to steer clear of that word but


---------25:49----------
um you know


---------25:52----------
let's put it this way it's it's a big


---------25:54----------
step right so basically


---------25:56----------
yeah like drastic is not entirely wrong


---------25:59----------
i i know i have like a little bit of a


---------26:01----------
negative connotation you take things too


---------26:03----------
far


---------26:04----------
but i it is um it's a significant


---------26:07----------
decision to make um especially like you


---------26:10----------
know the


---------26:11----------
the main surgery i've had is facial


---------26:12----------
feminization


---------26:14----------
which is a terrifying surgery like


---------26:16----------
you're changing your face


---------26:18----------
which is a very personal um thing you


---------26:21----------
know


---------26:21----------
um i think and there was a lot of fear


---------26:23----------
about that going into it i thought like


---------26:25----------
am i am i gonna lose myself like am i


---------26:28----------
gonna not


---------26:29----------
look like me anymore um and what


---------26:32----------
happened


---------26:34----------
well as it turns out i i basically just


---------26:36----------
love it


---------26:38----------
like i look more like myself now than i


---------26:40----------
did before interesting


---------26:42----------
in my case it was it was the right


---------26:44----------
decision


---------26:45----------
um i i but it's uh


---------26:49----------
it's certainly not something to do


---------26:50----------
lightly i think it's


---------26:52----------
uh you should it's good to spend a few


---------26:55----------
years honestly thinking about it before


---------26:57----------
you're doing it


---------26:58----------
because it's uh yeah it's an ordeal it's


---------27:01----------
an ordeal to go through it's a lot of


---------27:02----------
pain and difficulty and expense


---------27:05----------
to put yourself through um but i think


---------27:08----------
like to me i mean especially as someone


---------27:10----------
who's on camera all the time


---------27:12----------
like it really was a preoccupation that


---------27:15----------
i had this like


---------27:16----------
you know especially once i knew that


---------27:18----------
knew that was possible i was like i want


---------27:20----------
this is something i need for myself


---------27:23----------
yeah so let me ask you something so i


---------27:25----------
you know i probably am a little bit


---------27:27----------
disrespectful towards in cells more so


---------27:29----------
than i


---------27:30----------
i should be um and but i i sometimes


---------27:33----------
kind of struggle a little bit with like


---------27:35----------
that balance of changing yourself


---------27:37----------
because


---------27:38----------
there's a part of me and i think this


---------27:40----------
like sort of doesn't internally make


---------27:41----------
sense to me there's a part of me that


---------27:42----------
says that


---------27:44----------
you know it's completely fine if you


---------27:46----------
want to change your body but


---------27:48----------
something within me recoils from the


---------27:50----------
idea if i was talking to an incel


---------27:53----------
and they said you know i want a more


---------27:55----------
masculine jawline


---------27:56----------
or i want this kind of facial surgery to


---------27:59----------
make me look more chad-like


---------28:01----------
and i'm really not trying to make fun of


---------28:02----------
them now sometimes i do that i probably


---------28:04----------
shouldn't


---------28:05----------
it's hard not to because they do say


---------28:06----------
some ridiculous things but


---------28:09----------
there are very misogynistic things and


---------28:11----------
and so


---------28:12----------
i'm just trying to understand like you


---------28:16----------
know


---------28:16----------
is that the same or is that different


---------28:21----------
i think it's a complicated question like


---------28:23----------
uh


---------28:24----------
you know there's there's in cells who


---------28:26----------
are talking about plastic surgery who


---------28:27----------
are fixated on plastic surgery


---------28:29----------
within feminism there's discourse about


---------28:32----------
like


---------28:32----------
is this just women trying to meet like


---------28:35----------
oftentimes like racist and patriarchal


---------28:37----------
expectations about


---------28:39----------
female beauty i'm instead of just


---------28:41----------
learning to love themselves as they are


---------28:43----------
um


---------28:44----------
so i would say like would you know i


---------28:46----------
think that even an in-seller


---------28:48----------
or you know cis woman like has a


---------28:52----------
right has a right to get plastic surgery


---------28:53----------
as well of course i think that these


---------28:56----------
desire comes up from a different place


---------28:59----------
though


---------28:59----------
in a different um there's a different


---------29:01----------
kind of justification for it


---------29:03----------
like i think what like i think what's


---------29:05----------
kind of like aching us out


---------29:07----------
about in cell plastic surgery is that


---------29:09----------
oftentimes the


---------29:10----------
explanations they give for why they're


---------29:12----------
doing it are based on things that are


---------29:14----------
kind of false and deranged


---------29:16----------
like the notion that you need this


---------29:18----------
certain jawline for women to be


---------29:20----------
attracted to you and that's going to fix


---------29:22----------
everything like


---------29:24----------
that that doesn't make sense and it's


---------29:26----------
probably not true


---------29:28----------
and it's um it just comes from a


---------29:30----------
fundamentally misguided like


---------29:33----------
idea of like i mean it didn't and again


---------29:36----------
i don't want to say it's always the


---------29:37----------
wrong thing to do


---------29:38----------
like maybe you have an incredibly weak


---------29:40----------
chin and you just genuinely do look a


---------29:42----------
lot better with a


---------29:43----------
stronger jawline and that's going to


---------29:45----------
make you happy like maybe so


---------29:47----------
maybe so but maybe not and i've seen a


---------29:50----------
lot of people posting on insult forms


---------29:51----------
where it's like


---------29:52----------
there's patently nothing wrong with your


---------29:54----------
face and


---------29:55----------
they and they've but they've kind of


---------29:57----------
scapegoated


---------29:59----------
this they say this my physical


---------30:00----------
appearance like that's why i'm lonely


---------30:02----------
like that's the problem i have with


---------30:04----------
women like if i change this like


---------30:06----------
everything's gonna be fixed and that


---------30:08----------
is delusional thinking because i don't


---------30:11----------
think having a stronger jawline is going


---------30:13----------
to suddenly make you


---------30:14----------
you know women magnetized i mean


---------30:17----------
honestly that's so my experience with


---------30:20----------
the insults and part of the reason that


---------30:21----------
i make fun of in cells


---------30:22----------
is that i find that when i talk to a


---------30:25----------
person


---------30:26----------
i have trouble i've been looking for


---------30:28----------
what i call a true insult


---------30:30----------
for a long time and and what my


---------30:33----------
experience has been is that any time you


---------30:35----------
talk to a person who identifies as an


---------30:37----------
incel


---------30:38----------
if you i the more i talk to them the


---------30:41----------
more that i get to know them


---------30:42----------
i can't find an incel in there you know


---------30:45----------
what what i see is just relatively


---------30:48----------
regular


---------30:49----------
level of insecurity or you know concern


---------30:52----------
about their appearance or things like


---------30:53----------
that


---------30:54----------
um but it's you know it's interesting i


---------30:57----------
i just wonder a little bit about


---------30:59----------
some of these because you're sort of


---------31:00----------
mentioning like feminist


---------31:02----------
communities that sort of talk about a


---------31:04----------
particular body type that


---------31:06----------
is essentially the result of the


---------31:07----------
patriarchy and i'm wondering actually if


---------31:09----------
the converse is true and that's what the


---------31:11----------
incels feel that there's sort of this i


---------31:13----------
mean it sounds actually like the same


---------31:14----------
argument where it's like there's a


---------31:15----------
feminine standard of beauty um yeah


---------31:18----------
and and that people are being judged and


---------31:21----------
aligning towards that and i never


---------31:22----------
thought that feminists and in cells


---------31:24----------
would be making the same argument


---------31:26----------
but yeah this is the sparkly uh well i


---------31:29----------
think uh


---------31:30----------
i i think that i guess in cells 10 when


---------31:33----------
we talk about surgery they tend not to


---------31:34----------
be super critical of it


---------31:36----------
like they feel that there's this male


---------31:37----------
standard of beauty um


---------31:40----------
but oftentimes instead of attributing


---------31:42----------
that to say like patriarchy


---------31:43----------
this like social circumstance that could


---------31:45----------
be changed


---------31:47----------
they attribute it to like evolution the


---------31:50----------
nature of


---------31:51----------
the dating market and the nature of like


---------31:53----------
the you know competitive meeting and all


---------31:54----------
this kind of stuff


---------31:56----------
yeah but it seemed to think the female


---------31:58----------
brain is just wired to like this kind


---------32:00----------
of jaw you know whereas i think that the


---------32:02----------
feminist critique is more


---------32:04----------
it is the idea that like oh this is all


---------32:07----------
socially constructed


---------32:09----------
um now i think that with trans


---------32:12----------
surgery it's kind of


---------32:15----------
complicated because there's kind of a


---------32:17----------
little bit of of two different things


---------32:19----------
going on


---------32:20----------
one is like gender dysphoria there's a


---------32:22----------
person's individual internal sense


---------32:25----------
often totally against what a person has


---------32:27----------
been raised to think they should be


---------32:29----------
right


---------32:29----------
like i was raised to think i should be a


---------32:31----------
man why am i not doing that


---------32:33----------
like because there's something


---------32:34----------
individually about me that is like


---------32:36----------
rejected the script i was handed


---------32:40----------
um and so i think that like part of the


---------32:42----------
reason for my wanting to have surgery


---------32:44----------
was really just to


---------32:45----------
my personal desire to see myself as i


---------32:49----------
feel i should be


---------32:50----------
even against society to wanting me to


---------32:52----------
look like that however


---------32:55----------
when you start you know i live as a


---------32:56----------
woman and people judge me as a woman


---------32:59----------
and they judge my parents as they would


---------33:01----------
judge a woman's appearance a lot of the


---------33:02----------
time


---------33:03----------
with some complicating factors because


---------33:04----------
of the fact that people know that i'm


---------33:05----------
trans


---------33:06----------
um but i think that i


---------33:10----------
it's a question i definitely struggled


---------33:11----------
with when i was you know preparing to


---------33:13----------
get surgery


---------33:14----------
it's like who am i doing this for


---------33:16----------
exactly like am i doing this because


---------33:17----------
this is me is this what's going to make


---------33:19----------
me happy like this is what i want to see


---------33:21----------
in the mirror like this is all for me


---------33:23----------
or am i doing it because i think it's


---------33:25----------
gonna make me look


---------33:26----------
more socially acceptable and be more


---------33:29----------
desirable to other people


---------33:31----------
more um easily able to assimilate


---------33:35----------
and to other you know into society and


---------33:37----------
you yeah


---------33:38----------
and answers both yeah it's it's


---------33:40----------
interesting because there's actually


---------33:42----------
i really love that you mentioned that


---------33:44----------
because it's like where does the desire


---------33:45----------
to change come from


---------33:47----------
yeah does it come from wanting something


---------33:49----------
from other people right so if i'm let's


---------33:52----------
say like i want a stronger jawline to


---------33:54----------
attract more women


---------33:56----------
that doesn't feel that feels to me like


---------33:59----------
it's a desire to change yourself


---------34:01----------
to accommodate or have something to do


---------34:04----------
with the outside world


---------34:05----------
whereas what it's all about other people


---------34:07----------
and what they want yeah


---------34:08----------
and what i'm hearing from you is that


---------34:10----------
like the fundamental difference is like


---------34:12----------
i mean not to say that you don't want


---------34:13----------
something from the outside world as well


---------34:15----------
but that


---------34:15----------
there's a difference between wanting to


---------34:18----------
be satisfied with the way that


---------34:20----------
you look for your own sake as opposed to


---------34:23----------
wanting to look a particular way


---------34:26----------
for other people and to get something


---------34:29----------
from other people


---------34:30----------
absolutely like i think that for insults


---------34:33----------
this is all


---------34:34----------
they don't particularly seem to care


---------34:36----------
about looking in the mirror and seeing


---------34:37----------
this


---------34:38----------
whatever they're flawed a jaw or


---------34:39----------
whatever it is except that they think


---------34:42----------
that


---------34:42----------
this is holding them back socially or


---------34:45----------
sexually


---------34:46----------
and like if they could just fix this


---------34:49----------
part of their anatomy


---------34:50----------
then you know this would be a means to


---------34:52----------
the end of attracting women


---------34:55----------
and so natalie as you transitioned um


---------34:58----------
how were you


---------34:59----------
judged what's that been like for you


---------35:02----------
um well it's not easy to


---------35:06----------
especially online like people view i


---------35:08----------
mean people online are just who are just


---------35:10----------
horrible in general


---------35:11----------
are pretty horrible in general they can


---------35:13----------
be anyway they can also be amazing but


---------35:15----------
but there's a lot of like judgment and


---------35:17----------
negative judgment i think


---------35:18----------
women get scrutinized very very heavily


---------35:21----------
based on their appearance


---------35:22----------
and then trans women in particular i


---------35:24----------
find attract as certain like


---------35:27----------
like not from everyone but there's a


---------35:29----------
subset of people who are sort of


---------35:31----------
have this cruel obsession with trans


---------35:34----------
people and sort of analyzing them and


---------35:36----------
deconstructing them


---------35:38----------
and just picking us apart and that's


---------35:40----------
something that i've experienced a lot


---------35:42----------
and i would be lying if i had if i said


---------35:44----------
it didn't get to me


---------35:46----------
can you can you tell us a little bit


---------35:48----------
more about that


---------35:50----------
uh yeah well people when you know you


---------35:52----------
will see


---------35:53----------
sometimes it's youtube comments


---------35:55----------
sometimes it's you know


---------35:56----------
the responses to your tweets or comments


---------35:58----------
on instagram they'll have to say these


---------36:00----------
things for me


---------36:01----------
it mostly isn't that it's mostly what it


---------36:04----------
goes on like


---------36:06----------
in a secluded part of the internet you


---------36:09----------
know there used to be a


---------36:10----------
reddit subreddit called gender critical


---------36:13----------
which is which is like ostensibly like


---------36:15----------
a trans exclusionary radical feminist


---------36:18----------
way of thinking


---------36:18----------
but what you're often kind of what does


---------36:21----------
that mean


---------36:22----------
so there's a cut there's a there's a


---------36:24----------
faction of radical feminists


---------36:26----------
who are like vehemently opposed to trans


---------36:29----------
people


---------36:30----------
because they view trans women they


---------36:33----------
basically don't


---------36:34----------
think that being a trans person is


---------36:35----------
legitimate they view trans women as


---------36:38----------
men who are kind of impinging on female


---------36:41----------
space sort of invaders


---------36:43----------
interesting yeah and they sound like


---------36:46----------
gender appropriation


---------36:48----------
yeah that's often an argument they'll


---------36:49----------
make and then they view transformation


---------36:51----------
as like


---------36:52----------
as like our lost damaged sisters who


---------36:55----------
just are just internally misogynistic


---------36:57----------
and trying to be men to escape


---------36:59----------
um but like oftentimes people will just


---------37:02----------
judge other people for all kinds of


---------37:04----------
stuff


---------37:04----------
oh yeah people but it often just devolve


---------37:08----------
into like simple like


---------37:10----------
like a roasting basically and you know


---------37:12----------
it's not


---------37:13----------
it's not just them it's not just these


---------37:14----------
people there's there's a lot of people


---------37:16----------
on the internet who


---------37:17----------
enjoy this if you ever go to you know


---------37:19----------
4chan god help you


---------37:20----------
like there's people there's parts of


---------37:22----------
that website where they sort of will


---------37:24----------
obsess over trans people


---------37:25----------
and it's like it's especially bad if


---------37:28----------
you're yeah


---------37:28----------
there's a lot of criticisms to be made


---------37:30----------
for 4chan but oddly enough


---------37:32----------
and hopefully i'm not speaking out of


---------37:33----------
turn i was really surprised recently so


---------37:35----------
i


---------37:35----------
you know sometimes i work with people


---------37:36----------
with autism and it seems like it's


---------37:38----------
actually a pretty supportive place it's


---------37:41----------
it's for people with autism it's kind of


---------37:44----------
strange


---------37:46----------
it's a complicated website i mean


---------37:48----------
there's parts of it that um


---------37:50----------
that are like are pretty pleasant


---------37:52----------
there's there's


---------37:54----------
there's parts of it that have even like


---------37:56----------
kind of like


---------37:58----------
fostered some of the good parts of the


---------38:00----------
internet and people will


---------38:02----------
you know anonymously without any


---------38:04----------
expectation of thanks or


---------38:06----------
reward um like do very nice things for


---------38:09----------
each other


---------38:10----------
i've absolutely seen those how things


---------38:12----------
happen on 4chan but then it can also


---------38:14----------
devolve and it sort of depends on which


---------38:16----------
you know uh which form you're in


---------38:18----------
but it can develop it and just use


---------38:20----------
incredible nastiness and cruelty


---------38:22----------
also yeah and i think that especially


---------38:25----------
that that


---------38:26----------
tends to be within that with with trans


---------38:28----------
people


---------38:29----------
so i don't know it's not it's been a


---------38:31----------
common experience that i'll run across


---------38:33----------
i've gotten better at just avoiding this


---------38:35----------
kind of thing but you run across a forum


---------38:37----------
wherever it is where people are just


---------38:40----------
like


---------38:41----------
you know they're posting pictures of you


---------38:43----------
or videos of you and they're just like


---------38:45----------
tearing you apart like your physical


---------38:48----------
appearance


---------38:48----------
they're misgendering me they're either


---------38:51----------
they're dead naming me that's saying


---------38:53----------
like


---------38:53----------
you know oh look at his giant shoulders


---------38:56----------
look at his like


---------38:57----------
like will anyone ever believe that's a


---------38:59----------
real female voice like of course not


---------39:01----------
and like like this kind of it's just uh


---------39:05----------
it's very mean or they call you a sexual


---------39:07----------
pervert and say that you're just


---------39:08----------
narcissistic


---------39:09----------
and it's uh so a lot of it


---------39:13----------
it's very like cruel i guess and how


---------39:15----------
does that


---------39:16----------
i mean what's it like to be on


---------39:20----------
the receiving end of that well you feel


---------39:23----------
like


---------39:23----------
like a butterfly pinched to a board or


---------39:26----------
like a vivid section in a way


---------39:28----------
it's it's very it um it hurts it does


---------39:31----------
and like


---------39:32----------
and a lot you know i think of myself as


---------39:33----------
a very thick-skinned person


---------39:36----------
like i'm a person who's been arguing on


---------39:38----------
the internet for four


---------39:40----------
four plus years professionally i am


---------39:42----------
acquainted


---------39:43----------
with negative comments and negative


---------39:45----------
feedback


---------39:46----------
but i feel like this style of thing in


---------39:48----------
particular


---------39:49----------
has really hurt my self-image and it has


---------39:53----------
kind of


---------39:53----------
caused me to become like preoccupied


---------39:56----------
with my appearance


---------39:57----------
in a way that i think if i were not


---------39:59----------
online i never would have cared this


---------40:01----------
much


---------40:02----------
and in a way that i feel it sometimes is


---------40:04----------
pathological


---------40:06----------
what what kind of preoccupations


---------40:10----------
well i i feel um


---------40:13----------
i feel like i have to be very prepared


---------40:16----------
to go on camera


---------40:18----------
i i when i look at myself and the um


---------40:21----------
you know i'll glance over here and look


---------40:23----------
at my um


---------40:25----------
the my own monitor basically


---------40:29----------
and i'm just sort of analyzing it i


---------40:31----------
imagine the things that people are going


---------40:32----------
to say about me


---------40:34----------
and i guess you sort of internalize this


---------40:37----------
very negative


---------40:38----------
way of looking at you and


---------40:41----------
the worst part is then you you begin


---------40:43----------
just applying it to yourself


---------40:45----------
and maybe we're still applying it to


---------40:47----------
other trans people


---------40:48----------
what does that mean applying it to


---------40:50----------
yourself well you sort of look at


---------40:52----------
yourself with the owner


---------40:54----------
you're the same judgmental mean


---------40:57----------
kind of gaze other people look at you


---------41:01----------
so so i i find myself in if this is too


---------41:03----------
personal please let me know


---------41:05----------
natalie but i find myself like wanting


---------41:07----------
to know the actual


---------41:09----------
thoughts that go through your head


---------41:12----------
um that when when you see


---------41:16----------
like when and i would imagine that that


---------41:18----------
actually your


---------41:19----------
criticalness of your appearance


---------41:20----------
fluctuates personally


---------41:23----------
i would say i would hypothesize and i'm


---------41:25----------
curious about you know when it's more


---------41:26----------
active


---------41:28----------
what are the actual thoughts that you


---------41:29----------
have about yourself


---------41:32----------
like what thoughts kind of thoughts go


---------41:33----------
through your mind


---------41:36----------
well i will i will sort of i mean if i'm


---------41:39----------
filming a video for example i'll be


---------41:41----------
looking over


---------41:42----------
in the monitor and i'll see like you i


---------41:45----------
look like such a transsexual


---------41:47----------
and i'll say well you are transsexual


---------41:49----------
you idiot of course you look like one


---------41:51----------
and then and i'll you know i'll listen


---------41:53----------
to according to my voice and be like oh


---------41:55----------
god like that does not sound good


---------41:57----------
and you know it sounds like a fake voice


---------41:59----------
it sounds like i'm


---------42:00----------
trying too hard or i will um


---------42:04----------
like i can't watch like my old videos i


---------42:06----------
can't watch videos


---------42:07----------
from two years ago where i was sort of


---------42:09----------
like not as good at this


---------42:10----------
as i am now and those are just horribly


---------42:13----------
painful


---------42:14----------
and when you say horribly painful so i


---------42:17----------
i'm i'm going to share something with


---------42:19----------
you well let me just start off with this


---------42:21----------
so i i'm noticing there's actually two


---------42:23----------
things one is your reaction


---------42:25----------
and the second is your reaction to your


---------42:28----------
reaction


---------42:29----------
and i think a lot of toxicity that


---------42:31----------
people struggle with


---------42:32----------
in terms of the way they view themselves


---------42:34----------
actually comes from that second part


---------42:36----------
right one is like so


---------42:39----------
just to kind of repeat back to you and


---------42:41----------
this is why i'm asking so i want to try


---------42:43----------
to illustrate this


---------42:44----------
point for other people too that you look


---------42:45----------
at yourself and you say oh i look


---------42:47----------
like such a transsexual and then


---------42:52----------
sometimes people you know clip what i


---------42:54----------
say


---------43:04----------
so you know you you you say to yourself


---------43:07----------
oh i look like such a transsexual and


---------43:09----------
then actually i think


---------43:10----------
that's actually okay it to me but i


---------43:13----------
think the really damaging thing that we


---------43:14----------
do to ourselves is we


---------43:16----------
um we say of course you do


---------43:20----------
you're a [ __ ] transsexual right yes


---------43:23----------
and


---------43:24----------
and so like the funny thing is that you


---------43:25----------
can respond to that initial


---------43:27----------
observation in two ways which is like


---------43:30----------
yeah this is just


---------43:31----------
you know i'm i'm never gonna look like a


---------43:33----------
perfect woman because


---------43:35----------
you know somewhere in there there's a y


---------43:36----------
chromosome and that's okay


---------43:38----------
right like i can learn to be like i can


---------43:41----------
be accepting


---------43:42----------
that i'm not gonna look a particular way


---------43:44----------
or whatever but


---------43:45----------
but i think when we really get into


---------43:47----------
those dark places it's like you can make


---------43:49----------
an observation


---------43:50----------
which is fair right and then like but


---------43:54----------
then it's like the thing that we tell


---------43:55----------
ourselves


---------43:56----------
after the observation that's really


---------43:58----------
damaging


---------44:00----------
and what i find is that people try to


---------44:01----------
fix that first thought


---------44:03----------
which is they like try to convince


---------44:05----------
themselves that when i look in the


---------44:06----------
mirror


---------44:06----------
you know i don't want to look like


---------44:08----------
whereas like i think that's actually


---------44:10----------
missing a point which is that


---------44:11----------
it's it's okay to look like that like


---------44:14----------
yeah you know


---------44:16----------
no i agree that like i think that


---------44:18----------
something i sort of


---------44:19----------
i think is an area i've begun to approve


---------44:21----------
and prove a little bit recently


---------44:23----------
is is to say like oh yes i like a


---------44:26----------
transsexual well good


---------44:27----------
being transsexual is good and it's fine


---------44:29----------
it's like you're allowed to be a trans


---------44:31----------
woman


---------44:31----------
like you're allowed to it's allowed it's


---------44:34----------
it's an okay thing to be


---------44:35----------
and if you look like one okay you are


---------44:37----------
one and that's not bad


---------44:39----------
like i think that's like the more the


---------44:41----------
more healthy response


---------44:43----------
yeah and sometimes sometimes i'm like


---------44:45----------
feeling that sometimes i'm able to get


---------44:46----------
to that


---------44:47----------
point of confidence or i'm like well


---------44:49----------
yeah


---------44:50----------
and like that's fine and like that's not


---------44:52----------
something to be ashamed of


---------44:53----------
um and then sometimes i slide back into


---------44:56----------
like the negativity about it


---------44:58----------
yeah yeah so so in a weird way you say


---------45:00----------
and that's fine that's not something to


---------45:01----------
be ashamed of


---------45:02----------
i think like there's even one other


---------45:04----------
layer of compassion here


---------45:06----------
which is that if you're ashamed of it


---------45:08----------
it's okay to be ashamed of it


---------45:11----------
yeah accepting the shame and like yep i


---------45:14----------
guess


---------45:14----------
not blaming myself for it yeah


---------45:17----------
absolutely right so like like it's okay


---------45:19----------
to be ashamed


---------45:20----------
about your appearance like it's almost


---------45:22----------
like saying like okay i get where you're


---------45:23----------
coming from


---------45:24----------
cool man like don't beat yourself up


---------45:27----------
about it


---------45:28----------
um and i use man as a gender-neutral


---------45:29----------
term which i knew i know is going to get


---------45:31----------
me in trouble at some point


---------45:33----------
and i i try to catch myself but it


---------45:35----------
doesn't bother me


---------45:37----------
um so can you can you tell me natalie


---------45:39----------
and and once again if we you know touch


---------45:41----------
how are we doing so far am i asking you


---------45:42----------
questions that feel hurtful or personal


---------45:44----------
no no this is good okay this is i i


---------45:47----------
think it's actually really helpful


---------45:48----------
because i


---------45:49----------
i like hearing your actual thoughts


---------45:51----------
because i think that's


---------45:52----------
something that we all do whether you're


---------45:53----------
trans or cis or whatever


---------45:55----------
we all judge ourselves and then


---------45:58----------
oftentimes


---------45:59----------
beat ourselves up for our own judgment


---------46:03----------
and the wildest one i heard recently


---------46:05----------
which is so common


---------46:06----------
it just really hurts me sometimes to


---------46:08----------
hear that when people make progress


---------46:10----------
instead of being happy about it they


---------46:13----------
beat themselves up for not making


---------46:15----------
progress sooner


---------46:17----------
yeah it's one of the strangest


---------46:19----------
phenomenon but like instead of like


---------46:21----------
moving forward in life


---------46:22----------
as you start to move forward you start


---------46:23----------
beating yourself up more and you kind of


---------46:25----------
say like oh


---------46:26----------
why didn't i do this when i was 20 or


---------46:28----------
it's really strange anyway


---------46:30----------
oh it's well that's definitely how i


---------46:31----------
feel about transitioning like there's a


---------46:33----------
i think this is very common there's a


---------46:34----------
lot of regret for like why didn't i do


---------46:36----------
this earlier like


---------46:38----------
it would have been easier when i was


---------46:39----------
earlier i would have missed out on less


---------46:41----------
time and like it's uh you know i i


---------46:44----------
really


---------46:45----------
started taking hormones when i was 28 so


---------46:48----------
that's on the later side


---------46:50----------
um you know and i feel like oh it would


---------46:51----------
be if i'd done this when i was 19


---------46:53----------
this would have been so much easier had


---------46:55----------
a better result like


---------46:57----------
i would have wasted less time in this


---------46:58----------
like gender limbo that i spent a lot of


---------47:00----------
my 20s in


---------47:02----------
but i don't know it is like it's it's


---------47:04----------
just what i had to do it's just what i


---------47:06----------
had to go through to realize this to get


---------47:07----------
to where i am


---------47:09----------
so uh i try not to like to dwell on the


---------47:12----------
regret too much and like it could be


---------47:14----------
worse like it you know i


---------47:17----------
i did get it i got it in my 20s and like


---------47:19----------
you know things have gone pretty well


---------47:21----------
for me considering


---------47:23----------
it's not not necessarily something to


---------47:25----------
complain about but it is often


---------47:27----------
you know it's a kind of background


---------47:29----------
regret


---------47:30----------
yeah why not complain about it


---------47:33----------
well i don't know maybe it's fine to


---------47:34----------
complain about it okay


---------47:36----------
sometimes it also accompanies it as kind


---------47:38----------
of i think i think among trans people


---------47:40----------
envy is so common like


---------47:44----------
it's it's one of the things i feel makes


---------47:46----------
my community of trans people sort of


---------47:48----------
difficult for me to be around


---------47:50----------
is that i feel like there's


---------47:53----------
you know we're all sort of under the


---------47:55----------
same pressures and so there's this like


---------47:57----------
like girls who look amazing


---------48:01----------
and who kind of pass easily as women


---------48:04----------
and and just you know are kind of


---------48:07----------
thriving in that way


---------48:09----------
are they often intensely resented by


---------48:12----------
people who haven't made that


---------48:13----------
and the other side of this is that often


---------48:15----------
times like the people who are


---------48:17----------
you know trans women who are super


---------48:19----------
possible who are pretty zoo or whatever


---------48:21----------
like they they can be very contemptuous


---------48:24----------
of people who aren't


---------48:25----------
and i find myself often like in


---------48:28----------
both of those mindsets at various times


---------48:31----------
um


---------48:32----------
where you know sometimes i i will look


---------48:35----------
at the other


---------48:36----------
the trans women and particularly on


---------48:37----------
youtube who thrive and a lot of these


---------48:40----------
people are people who transitioned it


---------48:41----------
you know 16 17 18 another 22 and they're


---------48:45----------
gorgeous and they're perfect and i'm


---------48:47----------
just like oh god


---------48:48----------
like why am i even allowed to be on


---------48:50----------
camera around these people


---------48:52----------
um and then other times like you know i


---------48:55----------
think i will kind of


---------48:57----------
was a terrible part of psychology human


---------48:59----------
psychology


---------49:00----------
where the sort of abusive things that


---------49:03----------
are said about you


---------49:05----------
there's a sick pleasure and reiterating


---------49:07----------
those things that someone else


---------49:09----------
and i like um i'm sorry to say that i'm


---------49:12----------
not a buff


---------49:13----------
at least in my head doing that to other


---------49:15----------
trans women yeah


---------49:17----------
i think sometimes sometimes we forget


---------49:20----------
that


---------49:21----------
hatred is born of hurt in my


---------49:24----------
overwhelming experience


---------49:26----------
yes and and you know not not that this


---------49:29----------
is a conversation about themselves but i


---------49:31----------
think that's just another example of a


---------49:32----------
community where


---------49:34----------
most of these people that i talk to it's


---------49:36----------
usually like


---------49:37----------
there's some hurtful experience that


---------49:39----------
happens to them


---------49:41----------
and then they start to hate the thing


---------49:44----------
that hurt them which


---------49:45----------
unfortunately is part of being human um


---------49:48----------
yeah and and what what do you i mean


---------49:50----------
what is it


---------49:51----------
so it sounds like you're aware that you


---------49:53----------
experience envy and you sort of also


---------49:56----------
have some


---------49:56----------
mean thoughts what's that like


---------50:00----------
to like see someone who's like 16 and


---------50:02----------
has transitioned and


---------50:03----------
and i'm imagining a miss the boat sort


---------50:06----------
of kind of feelings that can


---------50:07----------
it's a very mystical feeling like it's


---------50:10----------
there's this there's this this intense


---------50:12----------
like


---------50:12----------
regret and longing and envy to have


---------50:15----------
gotten


---------50:16----------
what i miss you know what i mean i think


---------50:18----------
that there's definitely an element of


---------50:20----------
that


---------50:20----------
um and i


---------50:23----------
uh you know i try not to dwell on it


---------50:26----------
because i know it's it's totally


---------50:27----------
unproductive


---------50:28----------
i can't go back in time like you know it


---------50:31----------
is much better to look forward and be


---------50:33----------
grateful for what i had you have and


---------50:35----------
accept it but it is also you know it's


---------50:39----------
hard to entirely put it out of your mind


---------50:41----------
yeah so oddly enough um natalie i'd i'd


---------50:45----------
play devil's advocate there for a second


---------50:47----------
and i think part of the reason that


---------50:49----------
those feelings linger


---------50:51----------
is because you may not be dwelling on


---------50:54----------
them enough


---------50:56----------
right so like like i think that this is


---------50:58----------
a really challenging


---------51:00----------
tight rope to walk but the balance


---------51:02----------
between emotional processing


---------51:05----------
and like wallowing in regret whereas


---------51:08----------
yeah you know i i hear this thing a lot


---------51:11----------
and it sounds really positive and i


---------51:12----------
think generally speaking it is


---------51:14----------
but it's not true peace right so if you


---------51:17----------
say like oh like you look at that person


---------51:19----------
and you have thoughts of like


---------51:21----------
you know envy and you have thoughts of


---------51:23----------
regret and then you kind of say well i


---------51:24----------
should be grateful because at least i


---------51:26----------
did it


---------51:27----------
in my 20s and yeah i'm lucky enough to


---------51:29----------
have done


---------51:30----------
xyz and maybe i don't live in you know


---------51:33----------
a country that's less accepting of trans


---------51:36----------
people


---------51:36----------
and and so what happens is you take that


---------51:38----------
negativity and you like like


---------51:41----------
push it down with positivity yeah


---------51:44----------
yeah absolutely and that that's adaptive


---------51:47----------
but i think what i've seen is that like


---------51:48----------
then the negativity keeps


---------51:50----------
cropping up right and and ultimately


---------51:53----------
what you want to do is


---------51:54----------
is actually like accept that you know


---------51:56----------
mourn


---------51:58----------
right as opposed to regret and or even


---------52:01----------
just accept that


---------52:02----------
regret and accept that this is your i


---------52:05----------
i'm going to toss out a word karma or


---------52:07----------
karma like this is just


---------52:08----------
your path in your life and it's not


---------52:11----------
going to be perfect


---------52:13----------
um but it got to be careful because i


---------52:16----------
think a lot of times we try to squash


---------52:18----------
negativity with positivity especially if


---------52:20----------
we're like


---------52:21----------
you know pretty


---------52:25----------
um decent human beings for lack of a


---------52:27----------
better term


---------52:29----------
i've heard only i've heard this term


---------52:30----------
like toxic positivity thrown around


---------52:33----------
to describe this like sort of refusal to


---------52:37----------
engage with the negative


---------52:39----------
to the point where it becomes like


---------52:41----------
almost damaging


---------52:42----------
and or damaging yeah i was gonna say not


---------52:45----------
almost


---------52:46----------
no let's see it becomes damaging and


---------52:47----------
yeah i do think that especially like


---------52:50----------
because i have a i i'm very conscious of


---------52:52----------
the fact that like i can in the grand


---------52:54----------
scheme of things like i am lucky and


---------52:56----------
privileged


---------52:57----------
beyond most trans people and


---------53:01----------
there's a scent with that there's a


---------53:02----------
sense of like


---------53:04----------
i have no entitlement to this petty


---------53:08----------
regretful like moping


---------53:11----------
you know because i'm so lucky to have


---------53:13----------
what i have


---------53:14----------
but it is true that it it does that does


---------53:17----------
not


---------53:18----------
are you that sounds to me like toxic


---------53:21----------
positivity


---------53:22----------
yeah okay maybe so cause


---------53:25----------
because i i think let me let me like if


---------53:27----------
i can just share something with you


---------53:28----------
natalie like so


---------53:29----------
yeah i think this is a really common


---------53:33----------
problem i mean i think it's a problem


---------53:34----------
people disagree with me so i i think


---------53:36----------
that like


---------53:38----------
no amount of privilege


---------53:42----------
or luck it


---------53:45----------
excuses suffering right like so


---------53:48----------
like like would then i think he was


---------53:50----------
right about this sort of said that like


---------53:52----------
human beings suffer it's like part of


---------53:53----------
what we do and no matter how much you


---------53:55----------
have


---------53:55----------
we suffer and somewhere along the way


---------53:57----------
like we started blaming people who were


---------53:59----------
privileged for suffering


---------54:01----------
and i'm not saying that like people who


---------54:02----------
are privileged shouldn't appreciate it


---------54:04----------
right so this is really tricky because


---------54:06----------
people sort of say like if i express


---------54:08----------
suffering and i have some kind of


---------54:09----------
privilege


---------54:10----------
that i'm being ungrateful or you know


---------54:12----------
you you tell yourself that that like i'm


---------54:14----------
feel i'm entitled but i think you're


---------54:17----------
allowed to suffer and i think if you


---------54:18----------
have privilege you should use that


---------54:20----------
privilege for the betterment of the


---------54:21----------
world but


---------54:21----------
your individual suffering like no amount


---------54:23----------
of privilege and we can see this because


---------54:26----------
you know you can see a lot of people who


---------54:27----------
are very successful and have a lot of


---------54:28----------
money and things like that


---------54:30----------
who are clearly like distraught and bent


---------54:32----------
out of shape and things like that


---------54:33----------
celebrities and


---------54:34----------
and you know yeah political candidates


---------54:38----------
figures they're told there is this sense


---------54:41----------
that like


---------54:42----------
once you make it to a certain level like


---------54:46----------
well you've lost your right to complain


---------54:49----------
like


---------54:50----------
or or you cannot possibly be suffering


---------54:53----------
unless


---------54:54----------
there's something sort of wrong with you


---------54:56----------
right


---------54:57----------
like if you're if you if you have money


---------54:59----------
and you have success


---------55:00----------
and you're not happy well like you're


---------55:03----------
ungrateful you're spoiled you're not


---------55:04----------
aware of your privilege and if you just


---------55:06----------
be aware of how lucky you are


---------55:08----------
then you would be happy um but yeah i


---------55:12----------
found that not to be the case at all i


---------55:14----------
mean the last year


---------55:15----------
like this has been one of the hardest


---------55:17----------
years of my life


---------55:18----------
to be honest and it's also uh


---------55:21----------
oh well a lot of things um but but one


---------55:24----------
but certainly not a lack of like


---------55:26----------
you know career success like i'm i mean


---------55:29----------
this is i'm at the peak of this i've


---------55:30----------
never


---------55:31----------
you know i'm i'm doing financially very


---------55:33----------
well like


---------55:34----------
i'm doing the views thank you


---------55:38----------
the views are just pouring in like i can


---------55:41----------
count on a million views per video which


---------55:42----------
is like


---------55:43----------
it's wild it's like it's a lot of views


---------55:46----------
but most people are on this website on


---------55:48----------
this platform are lying to get that


---------55:50----------
money


---------55:51----------
and it's like i don't think i ever would


---------55:53----------
have believed


---------55:54----------
four years ago that having what i have


---------55:57----------
now


---------55:58----------
wouldn't have made me happier it would


---------56:00----------
just be unimaginable to think that oh


---------56:02----------
having all these things i wanted


---------56:04----------
if getting them wouldn't really make me


---------56:07----------
happier


---------56:08----------
but it doesn't and it's like it's


---------56:11----------
it's hard to like i don't know if i can


---------56:14----------
convince anyone of that i feel like it's


---------56:16----------
something you almost deceive for


---------56:17----------
yourself


---------56:18----------
um because i know it's not like no one


---------56:20----------
ever told me it's like it's almost like


---------56:22----------
platitudinous that like money doesn't


---------56:24----------
buy happiness


---------56:25----------
like we all say these things but


---------56:29----------
then when you're when you you don't


---------56:30----------
really believe them until you live them


---------56:33----------
yeah that's like that's kind of where


---------56:34----------
i'm at so


---------56:36----------
so um so many different places to go so


---------56:39----------
i'm going to give you three options that


---------56:41----------
i'd love to talk about let me know if


---------56:42----------
any


---------56:43----------
feel okay to you one is i'm a little bit


---------56:46----------
curious about


---------56:49----------
um what you think and feel when you


---------56:52----------
watch older videos of yourself


---------56:55----------
the reason i feel like that's important


---------56:56----------
is because i i hope natalie that you can


---------56:59----------
actually just


---------57:00----------
be at peace with where you are


---------57:03----------
and i think the way to really get there


---------57:06----------
is by confronting


---------57:08----------
you know what you've stuffed down about


---------57:10----------
the way that you look at yourself or the


---------57:12----------
way that you think about yourself


---------57:14----------
that's one second thing um which maybe


---------57:17----------
is a little bit more philosophical is to


---------57:19----------
think a little bit about


---------57:20----------
you know where does happiness come from


---------57:22----------
right so we do have these plat


---------57:24----------
you know these like platitudes um is


---------57:26----------
that


---------57:27----------
platitude that doesn't feel like is that


---------57:29----------
the right word


---------57:31----------
okay um about you know money doesn't buy


---------57:35----------
happiness and sort of this idea so then


---------57:37----------
like where does happiness come from


---------57:39----------
and what can we understand about the


---------57:41----------
nature of happiness


---------57:42----------
and the third thing that i find myself


---------57:44----------
being curious about is you said that the


---------57:45----------
last year hasn't been easy and i'm i'm


---------57:47----------
curious about what's been challenging


---------57:49----------
for you


---------57:50----------
because it sounds like from a


---------57:51----------
professional standpoint you're doing


---------57:52----------
really well you've cornered what made it


---------57:55----------
yeah and and so what do you what do you


---------57:57----------
think any of those


---------57:59----------
kind of resonate with you or that


---------58:01----------
they're all pretty good


---------58:03----------
i think uh yeah we'll start with um


---------58:10----------
sorry what was the first one the first


---------58:11----------
one was like what do you see when what


---------58:13----------
do you think of


---------58:14----------
what do you think or what happens in


---------58:15----------
your mind when you look at older videos


---------58:17----------
of yourself


---------58:18----------
oh yeah so i just can't stand it like


---------58:22----------
because i see someone you know at a much


---------58:25----------
earlier stage of transition


---------58:28----------
and like a lot of things are wrong with


---------58:30----------
what i'm seeing


---------58:31----------
like i'm seeing like uh you know like oh


---------58:34----------
god like i didn't know how to do makeup


---------58:36----------
properly it looks terrible


---------58:37----------
i what am i wearing like what kind of


---------58:40----------
cringy not understanding how to dress


---------58:43----------
yourself as a woman


---------58:44----------
thing is this like what i i hear my


---------58:47----------
voice which at the time is much worse


---------58:48----------
than it is now i mean


---------58:50----------
when i was you know if you go way back i


---------58:53----------
had like


---------58:53----------
a much deeper much more masculine voice


---------58:56----------
and then


---------58:57----------
there's also a lot of just deeply


---------58:59----------
awkward stages along the way


---------59:01----------
where my voice i'm trying to i'm trying


---------59:04----------
to sound


---------59:05----------
more feminine because i'm more womanly


---------59:07----------
i'm not succeeding


---------59:08----------
you know that's my impression of it it


---------59:10----------
sounds like strained


---------59:12----------
and false you know and it's like


---------59:16----------
there's already this success this like


---------59:18----------
such like negativity around


---------59:20----------
trans women being like men


---------59:23----------
trying to be women or men acting like


---------59:25----------
women that to like go back and see


---------59:27----------
myself


---------59:28----------
basically as that is very painful


---------59:32----------
what hurts about it well


---------59:35----------
it's a i guess it's


---------59:38----------
i'm at a point where i think of myself


---------59:41----------
like


---------59:42----------
i don't think of myself as a man trying


---------59:44----------
to be a woman


---------59:45----------
i think of myself as a woman with a male


---------59:47----------
path


---------59:49----------
um and so to see myself like as almost


---------59:52----------
this like


---------59:53----------
caricature of what i don't want to be of


---------59:56----------
what people


---------59:57----------
like i like to think what people


---------59:59----------
mistakenly think trans people are and


---------60:01----------
i'm like literally seeing myself as that


---------60:04----------
like it's like i just hurts because i


---------60:06----------
see


---------60:07----------
i sort of take the gaze that people


---------60:09----------
maybe see all trans people as


---------60:11----------
and i literally have seen myself that


---------60:13----------
way so interesting


---------60:15----------
yeah so what i'm hearing you say is that


---------60:17----------
like when you look at yourself from a


---------60:18----------
couple of years ago


---------60:20----------
yeah you see the negative stereotype of


---------60:23----------
a trans woman


---------60:25----------
you are the embodiment of what people


---------60:29----------
negatively you're like you're you're uh


---------60:32----------
you're the embodiment of the negative


---------60:34----------
representation of a trans woman


---------60:36----------
yeah that's exactly what it is yeah


---------60:39----------
have you ever seen this subreddit called


---------60:41----------
blunder years


---------60:43----------
no so it's it's it's like a great place


---------60:46----------
where people post like pictures of


---------60:48----------
themselves like


---------60:49----------
usually during teenage years or things


---------60:50----------
like that and yeah


---------60:52----------
and you know i guess to play on wonder


---------60:54----------
years but like the blunder years like


---------60:55----------
before you got to


---------60:57----------
be where you are you know when you were


---------60:59----------
transitioning


---------61:01----------
um you know it's interesting because


---------61:02----------
when i hear you talk about yourself the


---------61:04----------
the closest thing that i can think of is


---------61:06----------
actually like thinking about puberty


---------61:09----------
and just how awkward puberty is


---------61:12----------
i think that i think it has a lot of


---------61:14----------
parallels to


---------61:15----------
puberty i mean sometimes people are


---------61:17----------
trans you know trans world we call it


---------61:19----------
like


---------61:19----------
second adolescence meaning that it's


---------61:22----------
like a


---------61:22----------
a period where similarly your body is


---------61:25----------
changing


---------61:26----------
your identity is changing your social


---------61:28----------
world is changing


---------61:29----------
and so in a lot of ways you act like a


---------61:33----------
teenager


---------61:33----------
acts and you make mistakes that


---------61:35----------
teenagers make but i feel like this


---------61:37----------
additional layer of being undignified by


---------61:39----------
an older person doing it


---------61:42----------
and you know the person who should know


---------61:44----------
better we think right


---------61:45----------
and like that's the second part yeah


---------61:49----------
just just started interrupt but like you


---------61:51----------
know so like you set a standard like so


---------61:53----------
like you're allowed to blunder yeah


---------61:57----------
it's it's when you say that you should


---------61:58----------
know better like you're not


---------62:00----------
allowing yourself to go through a second


---------62:03----------
puberty


---------62:04----------
you know with all that entails including


---------62:06----------
the awkwardness and the incredible


---------62:08----------
yearbook pictures


---------62:09----------
right yeah no i think this is true i


---------62:12----------
think that like


---------62:13----------
i think that would help me a lot more if


---------62:15----------
i could reach a point of compassion of


---------62:17----------
seeing


---------62:18----------
this as like an awkward like sort of


---------62:21----------
pseudo-adolescent period um i guess


---------62:24----------
what is the obstacle to that well part


---------62:26----------
of it is that most people


---------62:28----------
don't transition right so there's not


---------62:31----------
like a widespread


---------62:32----------
cultural awareness and like relatability


---------62:35----------
to like because everyone knows


---------62:36----------
everyone can relate to looking back at


---------62:38----------
your like 16 year old yearbook and being


---------62:40----------
like oh god


---------62:41----------
right because i think most people kind


---------62:43----------
of do but but it's much harder to relate


---------62:45----------
to like


---------62:46----------
i don't know looking back at you at age


---------62:49----------
28


---------62:50----------
in your early transition stage making


---------62:52----------
all these terrible faux pas


---------62:54----------
and like and just like not having it


---------62:56----------
together


---------62:58----------
yeah so i can see what you're saying


---------62:59----------
about you know not having it relate


---------63:01----------
to the common experience um


---------63:05----------
but in my experience and there's a butt


---------63:07----------
there right so


---------63:08----------
natalie that i i think that relating to


---------63:10----------
a common mis


---------63:11----------
experience is a common mistake about


---------63:14----------
like


---------63:15----------
growth because i think actually the more


---------63:18----------
you look at your own growth


---------63:20----------
it sounds to me like you've grown


---------63:22----------
immensely and i think most of the growth


---------63:24----------
that you've gone through


---------63:25----------
has nothing to do with the common


---------63:27----------
experience in fact it has been


---------63:28----------
in spite of and separate from the common


---------63:30----------
experience which is your point exactly


---------63:31----------
yeah but what i'm saying is that if you


---------63:33----------
can grow so much without


---------63:35----------
sharing this like you know a common


---------63:37----------
experience with other people that common


---------63:39----------
experience is not


---------63:40----------
a necessity for growth and in my


---------63:42----------
experience it's actually like


---------63:44----------
personal introspection that


---------63:48----------
is the real answer right like i can


---------63:51----------
procrastinate and the rest of the world


---------63:53----------
can procrastinate and i can feel


---------63:54----------
validated


---------63:56----------
and connected to other people because we


---------63:58----------
all procrastinate


---------63:59----------
but ultimately my journey against


---------64:02----------
procrastination is one that i have to


---------64:04----------
walk


---------64:04----------
irrespective of what everyone else is


---------64:06----------
doing


---------64:08----------
and so you know what i'm hearing is like


---------64:11----------
i i just think that you've really got to


---------64:13----------
think about why you judge yourself so


---------64:16----------
harshly


---------64:18----------
right and where does that come from when


---------64:20----------
did that start


---------64:22----------
well i think it's a product of being


---------64:24----------
judged harshly by other people


---------64:26----------
like especially during those times when


---------64:29----------
like like i said people are


---------64:30----------
people who don't pull in punches they're


---------64:32----------
very mean like online and like


---------64:34----------
when you put yourself out there


---------64:36----------
especially on video


---------64:38----------
like there's not a lot of restraint that


---------64:41----------
people have in terms of saying what they


---------64:42----------
think about you


---------64:44----------
and so i feel like it's these series of


---------64:47----------
experiences of like


---------64:48----------
humiliation i guess and we're shaming


---------64:52----------
yeah where do you remember any


---------64:54----------
experiences of like


---------64:55----------
pretty strong humiliation or shame like


---------64:58----------
even before the age of 18


---------65:00----------
like even before you started to dabble


---------65:02----------
in this kind of stuff


---------65:06----------
um


---------65:08----------
well i yeah


---------65:11----------
i can um i mean i can remember like i


---------65:15----------
yeah i was i was when i was you know


---------65:17----------
early teenage years


---------65:19----------
i had like you know a girlfriend for


---------65:22----------
whatever that meant at the time you know


---------65:23----------
for two years


---------65:24----------
and sorry not to for two months um and


---------65:27----------
like


---------65:28----------
i remember like one of her reasons like


---------65:30----------
for breaking up with me


---------65:32----------
was this sense of like why can't you be


---------65:35----------
normal


---------65:36----------
like why why are you wearing your hair


---------65:38----------
like that why you just advised that


---------65:39----------
you're framing little like


---------65:41----------
to see you know like and and


---------65:45----------
so there was a sense of shame about that


---------65:48----------
there was a period where like i did try


---------65:50----------
to be like more like a normal man


---------65:52----------
um i think that when i was when i was


---------65:54----------
looking around in my early twenties


---------65:56----------
especially i was like


---------65:57----------
i was giving it a real try um so


---------66:00----------
i think all i think that like the first


---------66:03----------
part of the shame was the shame


---------66:04----------
about being like i mean at the time like


---------66:08----------
you know a a male identified person or


---------66:12----------
male 1


---------66:12----------
i'm just functioning as a man in society


---------66:15----------
but with this like sense of that it was


---------66:17----------
wrong for me and is longing to do


---------66:18----------
something else


---------66:19----------
but a thing that like you're very


---------66:21----------
strongly discouraged from doing


---------66:24----------
as a man right so i i think that like


---------66:27----------
there's a kind of identity fracture at


---------66:29----------
some point in here because now obviously


---------66:31----------
i don't apply


---------66:32----------
the standards of manhood to myself but


---------66:35----------
it was a time when i actually did


---------66:37----------
and i felt that you know so there was


---------66:40----------
this kind of


---------66:41----------
shame around that um and then when i


---------66:45----------
transitioned you know


---------66:46----------
that involved overcoming that shame to


---------66:48----------
to to sort of put myself out there as


---------66:50----------
like no i'm actually


---------66:51----------
a different person than you think i am


---------66:54----------
and


---------66:55----------
like it's just it's a shameful thing


---------66:57----------
that is not


---------66:58----------
except socially acceptable but like here


---------67:01----------
here it is


---------67:02----------
um so there was like this moment i guess


---------67:04----------
of triumph them


---------67:06----------
about of having overcome a kind of shame


---------67:09----------
but i feel that it was replaced in a way


---------67:13----------
with an almost a whole new world of


---------67:15----------
shame


---------67:16----------
where it's like you're you know you go


---------67:18----------
from shame from not being


---------67:20----------
a good enough man to not being a good


---------67:22----------
enough woman


---------67:24----------
as people start judging you by different


---------67:26----------
standards


---------67:27----------
yeah so so natalie this may be you know


---------67:29----------
a touch academic


---------67:31----------
and and you know i'd say that if you're


---------67:33----------
interested i don't know if you you see a


---------67:34----------
therapist or


---------67:35----------
you know have anyone that you can kind


---------67:37----------
of confide or work


---------67:39----------
through things but if you don't i think


---------67:41----------
this is a great kind of


---------67:43----------
thing to work through with someone but


---------67:45----------
um and maybe you already have


---------67:47----------
but i think that you got to be really


---------67:49----------
careful there so my understanding of


---------67:50----------
of the mind comes primarily from like


---------67:53----------
yogic theory and like eastern


---------67:55----------
conceptions of mind


---------67:56----------
and i think that essentially what


---------67:58----------
happens is you've got like this ball of


---------68:00----------
shame


---------68:00----------
which just changed clothing and the


---------68:03----------
tricky thing there and i think this is


---------68:05----------
why things don't get better is because


---------68:07----------
so it totally makes sense that people


---------68:09----------
are toxic towards you on the internet


---------68:10----------
like that's going to leave a mark and


---------68:12----------
that's going to change the way


---------68:13----------
that you talk to yourself completely


---------68:15----------
agree actually after hearing your story


---------68:17----------
i think that there is the the real red


---------68:21----------
herring here


---------68:22----------
is that you did triumph but that there


---------68:25----------
was a piece of it that was left over


---------68:28----------
and like changed clothing and then


---------68:30----------
started to be like


---------68:31----------
but that toxicity actually lingered and


---------68:33----------
i suspect that it actually started way


---------68:35----------
before your transition


---------68:37----------
i think i think it started with the way


---------68:38----------
that you started to talk to yourself


---------68:41----------
as these trans feelings like so your


---------68:43----------
lack of acceptance for who you are


---------68:46----------
doesn't come from youtube i mean i know


---------68:48----------
that youtube comments can be


---------68:50----------
really impactful for people but i think


---------68:51----------
you've been carrying that with you for a


---------68:53----------
long time


---------68:55----------
now i think you're right about that i i


---------68:57----------
think that you know i'm thinking back


---------68:59----------
so i transitioned in 2017 that's when i


---------69:02----------
started medically


---------69:02----------
transitioning but like there was an


---------69:04----------
earlier period where i considered it


---------69:07----------
back in it was in 2014


---------69:10----------
and that you know i was living in


---------69:13----------
chicago at the time


---------69:14----------
i was kind of experimenting with


---------69:16----------
dressing more androgynously i would go


---------69:18----------
out with nail polish and like you know


---------69:20----------
makeup on and i i was i was sort of


---------69:24----------
moving this direction that that


---------69:25----------
is like sort of difficult of someone


---------69:26----------
who's like moving towards the gender


---------69:28----------
transition


---------69:29----------
but i can remember having experiences


---------69:32----------
of like seeing other trans women who


---------69:35----------
looked like


---------69:36----------
me like out in public like on the subway


---------69:39----------
and having this strong reaction of like


---------69:42----------
you know oh god


---------69:43----------
no i can't be that i do not want to be


---------69:45----------
that i can't look like that this is not


---------69:46----------
acceptable


---------69:47----------
and then like that shame causing me to


---------69:50----------
like nail polish gone make up god


---------69:52----------
get it together like we can't i can't be


---------69:54----------
that you know


---------69:55----------
which is like a really ugly thing to


---------69:57----------
think about someone else


---------69:59----------
right a horrible thing to think about


---------70:00----------
another trans woman


---------70:02----------
but it was not based it was it was it


---------70:05----------
was it was


---------70:05----------
sort of disgust with myself in another


---------70:07----------
person in a way


---------70:09----------
absolutely it was yeah it was seeing


---------70:11----------
like oh god people are going to see me


---------70:12----------
the way they see her


---------70:13----------
and like i can't i can't handle that so


---------70:15----------
i know this sounds bizarre natalie but i


---------70:17----------
i jotted down i've been taking very few


---------70:20----------
notes but one of the things that i


---------70:21----------
jotted down


---------70:22----------
is i wrote down the word someone and


---------70:25----------
it's so interesting because when i


---------70:26----------
actually asked you


---------70:28----------
what do you think when you


---------70:33----------
look at videos of yourself from a couple


---------70:35----------
of years ago


---------70:36----------
it's the first time i heard you use the


---------70:38----------
third person talking about yourself


---------70:41----------
yeah it's it's it's like a tiny thing


---------70:43----------
and then you switched into first person


---------70:45----------
but like it was a strange way because


---------70:47----------
like it's almost like


---------70:50----------
you know the thoughts that you the


---------70:52----------
thoughts that come


---------70:53----------
up when you look at old videos from


---------70:55----------
yourself


---------70:56----------
sound to me exactly like the thoughts


---------70:58----------
that came up when you saw someone who


---------71:00----------
was transitioning


---------71:03----------
absolutely it's absolutely bad it's like


---------71:06----------
it's like i'm seeing like this shameful


---------71:10----------
thing i see in others i see in myself so


---------71:12----------
it's almost like i don't know which came


---------71:14----------
first was it me being sort of judgmental


---------71:16----------
and transphobic towards other people


---------71:18----------
or was it being judgmental and


---------71:20----------
transferred towards myself


---------71:21----------
i don't know so natalie this is a i'm


---------71:24----------
gonna take a shot in the dark it's not


---------71:26----------
transphobia towards other people it's


---------71:28----------
actually envy


---------71:30----------
i think at the root of this is your envy


---------71:32----------
for the ugly person


---------71:34----------
how so because i think that like you saw


---------71:37----------
those people


---------71:38----------
and you saw them doing something that


---------71:41----------
you thought was


---------71:42----------
ugly and i think deep down you wanted to


---------71:45----------
do it too


---------71:46----------
sure yeah and and so i think there's


---------71:49----------
more there than transphobia there's more


---------71:51----------
there than revulsion


---------71:53----------
there's i think as you mentioned right


---------71:55----------
like like i think there's envy wrapped


---------71:57----------
up in that


---------71:58----------
that like i don't have the courage


---------72:01----------
to be the ugly person that maybe i


---------72:05----------
should be


---------72:06----------
i don't have the courage to be ugly


---------72:09----------
yeah i'm afraid i no it is it is that


---------72:11----------
it's like


---------72:12----------
i it is a kind of i guess cowardice like


---------72:15----------
i can't


---------72:16----------
especially at the time like it was like


---------72:18----------
i


---------72:19----------
cannot handle the life this person is


---------72:22----------
living


---------72:23----------
yep right so so i think that


---------72:26----------
self-judgment doesn't come


---------72:28----------
i mean so i think you know if you look


---------72:30----------
at the internet the internet is going to


---------72:32----------
call you


---------72:32----------
many things natalie but coward is not


---------72:35----------
going to be one of them


---------72:38----------
yeah maybe not right so that sense of


---------72:40----------
cowardice doesn't come from the outside


---------72:42----------
it comes from you


---------72:44----------
it comes from your own judgment about


---------72:47----------
not doing this thing and that's like


---------72:48----------
regret is rolled into that too


---------72:51----------
yeah right like what do you regret that


---------72:53----------
you weren't


---------72:55----------
what you weren't courageous


---------72:58----------
you didn't do it earlier you do it


---------73:00----------
earlier yeah right and then you judge


---------73:02----------
yourself


---------73:03----------
for like not being courageous whereas


---------73:05----------
like


---------73:07----------
i mean you know i don't mean this to be


---------73:09----------
demeaning but i think you were like you


---------73:10----------
like literally went through


---------73:12----------
like a second puberty right you went


---------73:13----------
through a coming of age you went through


---------73:17----------
i mean you're a late bloomer and i think


---------73:20----------
this is something that uh


---------73:21----------
i think a lot of our community like on


---------73:23----------
twitch and gamers and whatnot like


---------73:25----------
people who watch youtube like we hold


---------73:27----------
ourselves to a certain standard of time


---------73:29----------
like life is a race


---------73:30----------
and then we're falling behind and it's


---------73:33----------
very biased towards like


---------73:34----------
very young people because that's who's


---------73:36----------
represented on these platforms


---------73:39----------
yeah and and we kind of look at all


---------73:41----------
these people and


---------73:42----------
and we like look at ourselves and we say


---------73:44----------
like oh i'm behind and it's like i i


---------73:46----------
don't know how to stress this to you


---------73:47----------
natalie but


---------73:48----------
because i think you understand this


---------73:49----------
stuff i think the interesting thing


---------73:50----------
about think about the way the mind works


---------73:52----------
is that


---------73:52----------
you activate your mind activates certain


---------73:54----------
programming which is not


---------73:57----------
the natalie that i'm talking to it's


---------73:59----------
like a natalie from a couple of years


---------74:01----------
ago like these feelings are old they're


---------74:02----------
not like current feelings it's kind of


---------74:04----------
weird


---------74:05----------
but you know it's like it's just like


---------74:07----------
like opening up an old picture of


---------74:08----------
yourself like


---------74:09----------
looking at an old picture like that


---------74:11----------
picture retains the age


---------74:13----------
at which it was taken even though you


---------74:15----------
can grow and change


---------74:16----------
you have these things in your mind that


---------74:18----------
are like


---------74:19----------
relics of your past


---------74:24----------
and when those things activate you know


---------74:25----------
i think there's a lot of envy


---------74:27----------
towards people who are more courageous i


---------74:29----------
think there's a lot of


---------74:31----------
lack of acceptance towards yourself


---------74:33----------
which we kind of have been talking about


---------74:35----------
but i think what you've really got to


---------74:36----------
think about or what i would you know


---------74:38----------
encourage you to read about or think


---------74:40----------
about is just to really recognize that


---------74:42----------
like


---------74:43----------
you were supposed to be quote unquote


---------74:45----------
don't even steer clear of that


---------74:47----------
right that was just that's just what


---------74:49----------
happens in puberty like


---------74:50----------
people start getting acne and their


---------74:52----------
voice cracks and like it's just an


---------74:54----------
awkward time that's part of your


---------74:57----------
journey and i think what keeps you from


---------75:00----------
being happy today


---------75:02----------
and now we can maybe transition to


---------75:04----------
happiness but is that like


---------75:06----------
ultimately you know success and stuff is


---------75:07----------
fantastic i i don't think that that


---------75:09----------
doesn't contribute to your happiness


---------75:11----------
it's just that


---------75:11----------
you're carrying these things from the


---------75:13----------
past


---------75:15----------
and as long as you you know view


---------75:17----------
yourself as a coward as long as you


---------75:20----------
um because you're very self-aware


---------75:22----------
incredibly insightful incredibly


---------75:24----------
insightful


---------75:25----------
very aware of your internal process


---------75:27----------
you're really gifted in that way


---------75:30----------
and and um i i i mean i think you have


---------75:33----------
to be to transition right like you've


---------75:34----------
got to really dig in there and see like


---------75:36----------
oh wow


---------75:37----------
this gender is not what i feel like as a


---------75:40----------
person


---------75:41----------
um but i think until you sort of work on


---------75:44----------
that stuff i i think happiness is gonna


---------75:46----------
be


---------75:47----------
around the corner unfortunately which


---------75:49----------
doesn't mean that you can't enjoy things


---------75:50----------
and you can't be happy but


---------75:52----------
that old hurt you're going to carry with


---------75:54----------
you


---------75:57----------
yeah i think well i guess that's the


---------75:59----------
thought i've had i thought before that


---------76:00----------
like if i could


---------76:02----------
be if i could find like some kind of


---------76:04----------
love


---------76:05----------
for that person that i'm like so


---------76:08----------
urgently feel feeling willing to


---------76:12----------
distance myself from


---------76:14----------
um then i think it would i think i would


---------76:16----------
have a more peaceful


---------76:19----------
mind um because it is kind of a burden


---------76:23----------
to


---------76:24----------
feel i mean especially because like as a


---------76:26----------
youtuber like


---------76:27----------
like i'm never gonna to me it feels like


---------76:29----------
a ball and chain like my own path feels


---------76:31----------
like a ball and chain that i'm dragging


---------76:32----------
around


---------76:33----------
because i made that what i think is a


---------76:35----------
ridiculous decision


---------76:37----------
to transition with the camera on and


---------76:40----------
it's like oh why did i do that why would


---------76:43----------
i


---------76:44----------
put myself in this position now where


---------76:46----------
i'm sort of because


---------76:48----------
online it's like time it's it's like


---------76:51----------
frozen it's frozen yes it's like it's


---------76:55----------
like


---------76:55----------
like people perceive you as this like


---------76:57----------
four dimensional


---------76:58----------
like like uh you know ever


---------77:02----------
present person or the past is just as


---------77:04----------
immediate as the present because they


---------77:06----------
can just


---------77:06----------
you know you can watch my video from


---------77:08----------
three years ago and there it is right on


---------77:09----------
your screen you're gonna hear my voice


---------77:10----------
you see my face


---------77:11----------
it's like that person is there still um


---------77:15----------
so so yeah natalie i have a


---------77:20----------
pseudo-meditative exercise for you which


---------77:22----------
i think could be


---------77:24----------
challenging and painful but i think


---------77:26----------
could help you a lot


---------77:27----------
you want to give it a go sure okay


---------77:31----------
so this is what i'm going to ask you to


---------77:32----------
do okay i'm going to walk you through it


---------77:34----------
and then


---------77:35----------
you're allowed to say hey i actually


---------77:37----------
don't want to do that okay


---------77:39----------
okay so so here's so when you look at


---------77:42----------
pictures of yourself or videos of


---------77:43----------
yourself


---------77:46----------
you know you react a particular way


---------77:48----------
totally fine


---------77:49----------
you know you think certain things about


---------77:52----------
yourself and you sort of externalize


---------77:55----------
them


---------77:56----------
like you sort of turn it but you think


---------77:57----------
certain things about yourself i can't


---------77:58----------
believe i was like that whatever


---------78:00----------
so that's a very selfish way of thinking


---------78:03----------
right because when you look at yourself


---------78:04----------
you're thinking like oh i'm so


---------78:06----------
dumb by by selfish maybe self-centered


---------78:08----------
or self-focused is a better way to think


---------78:09----------
about it


---------78:10----------
all of your thoughts are about you and


---------78:12----------
that can be hard to develop compassion


---------78:15----------
when you're just kind of thinking about


---------78:16----------
you so what i like to try to do i've


---------78:18----------
never really done this before but


---------78:19----------
hopefully it'll work


---------78:20----------
maybe it'll help maybe it'll be a


---------78:21----------
complete train wreck is i want you to


---------78:23----------
when as you watch that video


---------78:25----------
what i want you to do is first of all


---------78:27----------
notice those things right and notice


---------78:29----------
that those are thoughts about


---------78:30----------
yourself or maybe someone else is a


---------78:32----------
little bit clear but then i want you to


---------78:34----------
ask yourself one question is you watch


---------78:35----------
that person


---------78:37----------
and that is or maybe you can just tell


---------78:39----------
us not so much about what that person is


---------78:41----------
doing right or wrong but what does that


---------78:43----------
person


---------78:43----------
need


---------78:46----------
right what is that were you calling


---------78:48----------
yourself natalie back then


---------78:50----------
yeah yeah right so like think about like


---------78:52----------
what did that person like need more than


---------78:55----------
anything else in the world like what is


---------78:56----------
that person's experience of life in that


---------78:59----------
moment


---------79:01----------
you know and really try to like put


---------79:03----------
yourself back in those shoes instead of


---------79:05----------
judging it try to be


---------79:07----------
empathetic and just like what like as


---------79:09----------
you look at that


---------79:10----------
that image of yourself and you guys can


---------79:12----------
do this to anyone who's watching right


---------79:13----------
if you regret something


---------79:15----------
or you judge yourself to like go back


---------79:17----------
and and try to think about


---------79:19----------
you know if you could go back in time


---------79:23----------
and actually have a conversation with


---------79:26----------
that person from three years ago


---------79:27----------
what would you say to them and if the


---------79:31----------
hypothetical is enough we can talk about


---------79:33----------
it otherwise i would encourage you to


---------79:35----------
actually pull up


---------79:36----------
an image of yourself and look at it and


---------79:38----------
watch what happens


---------79:41----------
well i think like on the top of my head


---------79:43----------
without even looking


---------79:45----------
i mean i i feel that what i just needed


---------79:48----------
was like


---------79:49----------
i just needed time like i needed time


---------79:52----------
to make those mistakes and time to like


---------79:56----------
work on the things that needed to be


---------79:57----------
worked on


---------79:58----------
worked on and like you know i


---------80:01----------
i know it's gonna things are gonna be


---------80:03----------
okay now


---------80:04----------
but it's like and at the time i just


---------80:06----------
needed the i just needed the experience


---------80:10----------
to to learn how to how to sort of


---------80:13----------
become a more comfortable uh


---------80:17----------
self that's not this kind of like person


---------80:19----------
who's sort of straining


---------80:22----------
to be what i couldn't yet be right so


---------80:25----------
so like if i were to tell you natalie


---------80:27----------
i'm gonna try to pretend to be you


---------80:29----------
from three years ago and i'm gonna say


---------80:32----------
i'm


---------80:32----------
trying this stuff out and i feel really


---------80:35----------
really dumb about myself because when i


---------80:36----------
look at myself in the mirror i'm ugly


---------80:39----------
yeah i don't know who i am


---------80:43----------
but i know it's not this what would you


---------80:46----------
say


---------80:50----------
uh well i'd say look like first of all


---------80:54----------
like you're not


---------80:55----------
that ugly like it's really not


---------80:58----------
worth worrying about it but like also


---------81:01----------
more to the point like


---------81:03----------
you know i understand that you're not


---------81:05----------
happy with who you are and you're trying


---------81:06----------
to be someone else


---------81:08----------
but like the way this works is


---------81:14----------
you have to you can't try to become


---------81:16----------
someone else


---------81:17----------
you have to learn how to become


---------81:20----------
you have to learn how to express


---------81:22----------
yourself


---------81:23----------
and i know sometimes it feels like


---------81:26----------
okay but i'm transitioning so shouldn't


---------81:29----------
i be trying to get away


---------81:31----------
from you know this thing that i used to


---------81:33----------
be that i don't want to be


---------81:35----------
and it's like in a sense that's true


---------81:38----------
but also i think that


---------81:41----------
you know doing it by forcing it


---------81:45----------
is sort of i don't know uh


---------81:49----------
it's making things worse than it would


---------81:52----------
be if you had a more relaxed


---------81:54----------
attitude towards this and like


---------81:57----------
weren't trying to sort of rush it so


---------81:58----------
much because in some ways i thought


---------82:01----------
yeah but if i had started earlier like i


---------82:03----------
went through


---------82:04----------
like a male puberty yeah and so because


---------82:07----------
of the testosterone like my jaw is


---------82:09----------
bigger now i've developed all these


---------82:11----------
secondary characteristics


---------82:13----------
like i i mean you're telling me that i


---------82:15----------
shouldn't force it but like


---------82:18----------
i'm telling you that i should have


---------82:19----------
forced it a long time ago


---------82:22----------
that's so well because if i started this


---------82:25----------
process


---------82:25----------
earlier like i wouldn't be in this


---------82:27----------
situation i wouldn't be awkward now yeah


---------82:29----------
well that's also true that i you know if


---------82:32----------
i had


---------82:34----------
if i had done this you know earlier then


---------82:36----------
i could have sort of gotten myself


---------82:38----------
together


---------82:38----------
faster and i wouldn't have such a long


---------82:41----------
period of the


---------82:43----------
past that i feel is like an alienated


---------82:45----------
from


---------82:46----------
so great so i don't know if you noticed


---------82:48----------
but that's exactly what you should do


---------82:50----------
so i think we just flipped i think we


---------82:52----------
hit the barrier i don't know if twitch


---------82:53----------
chat is going to understand this


---------82:54----------
is just all in my head so like


---------82:58----------
i think you did a fantastic job of


---------83:00----------
talking to yourself


---------83:03----------
the message that you sent to yourself is


---------83:05----------
exactly


---------83:06----------
what you should be thinking and and yeah


---------83:09----------
right like i just go back and like watch


---------83:12----------
this later


---------83:13----------
but like that's not what you say to


---------83:16----------
yourself but it's exactly what you need


---------83:18----------
need to hear and it's exactly how you


---------83:20----------
need to talk to yourself


---------83:22----------
which is not dismissing the negativity


---------83:25----------
it's just saying hey this takes time and


---------83:28----------
you're gonna have to figure it out and


---------83:29----------
it's gonna be a bumpy ride


---------83:32----------
yeah right that's what you told yourself


---------83:34----------
but those aren't the thoughts that you


---------83:35----------
actually have when you look at a picture


---------83:37----------
but now what i want you to do is the


---------83:39----------
next time you look at a picture of


---------83:40----------
yourself from a couple years ago


---------83:43----------
see those two conflicts right just like


---------83:45----------
your philosophy degree where you take


---------83:47----------
the other side


---------83:48----------
and you try to sit in it now you've got


---------83:50----------
both sides of the argument and just


---------83:52----------
swim in those waters i don't know how


---------83:53----------
else to put it to you now


---------83:55----------
just swim in that space i have faith


---------83:58----------
that given your


---------83:59----------
degree of self-understanding given your


---------84:02----------
analytical capability


---------84:04----------
and given your earnestness for lack of a


---------84:07----------
better term


---------84:08----------
if you just give your mind and your


---------84:11----------
brain the opportunity to swim around


---------84:13----------
in those thoughts and feelings you're


---------84:15----------
gonna come out fine


---------84:18----------
and then what happened is i asked you


---------84:20----------
about the regret


---------84:22----------
and then you had trouble talking to


---------84:24----------
yourself in the right way


---------84:27----------
right so like then you started like


---------84:29----------
going back to your standard thought


---------84:31----------
pattern i don't know if that makes sense


---------84:32----------
but i've never heard you talk about


---------84:35----------
the old you in the way that you did


---------84:37----------
during this exercise


---------84:40----------
but i think we hit the border of kind of


---------84:43----------
where your exploration is


---------84:45----------
and like where your compassion is and


---------84:46----------
where your empathy is


---------84:48----------
does that make sense to y'all like i


---------84:51----------
don't know but anyway does that make


---------84:52----------
sense to you


---------84:53----------
i think well i think in a sense yeah


---------84:55----------
because it's like


---------84:57----------
the more compassionate i guess i guess


---------84:59----------
response is like


---------85:00----------
i was doing my best at the time now


---------85:03----------
maybe that's not


---------85:04----------
good enough at my standard now but it's


---------85:06----------
like


---------85:07----------
stop time so so now you're


---------85:09----------
intellectualizing that's not what you


---------85:11----------
were doing earlier


---------85:12----------
right now you can because you're [ __ ]


---------85:14----------
smart natalie so you can


---------85:16----------
come up with logically what the right


---------85:18----------
answer is but logically the right answer


---------85:20----------
is not actually empathy or compassion


---------85:23----------
yeah the way that you were talking to


---------85:25----------
yourself was not a logical conclusion


---------85:28----------
about what this person needs to hear


---------85:30----------
it's an empathic connection it's like a


---------85:33----------
[ __ ]


---------85:34----------
i know what it's like to be there and


---------85:36----------
and friend you just need time


---------85:38----------
right it's not the it's absolutely the


---------85:40----------
right answer but it's coming from


---------85:43----------
once again like you know it's not coming


---------85:45----------
from the outside it's coming from within


---------85:48----------
and so i don't care about what


---------85:49----------
compassionately what you should say to


---------85:52----------
yourself


---------85:54----------
because you can't say that to yourself


---------85:55----------
yet but you i think you


---------85:58----------
clearly i mean at least to me you've


---------85:59----------
made progress today


---------86:01----------
i don't know if that makes sense but i'm


---------86:02----------
sorry i think no i think it's i mean


---------86:05----------
honestly like


---------86:05----------
i think a lot of this has been like more


---------86:07----------
helpful than a lot of actual therapy


---------86:08----------
i've been to like


---------86:09----------
i think that like like i mean i think


---------86:13----------
you're doing


---------86:13----------
good but i think that um uh


---------86:17----------
like we've zeroed in pretty quickly on


---------86:19----------
some things that are like the major


---------86:20----------
problems


---------86:22----------
um i will say like i guess that another


---------86:25----------
i guess maybe something that holds me


---------86:26----------
back somewhat is like because of the


---------86:28----------
public nature of this


---------86:30----------
even if i feel that even if i can sort


---------86:32----------
of form a kind of compassion for that


---------86:34----------
past self


---------86:36----------
i sort of feel the way that i was judged


---------86:39----------
at the time and there's this fear that


---------86:41----------
i'm going to be continuously judged


---------86:43----------
now for the way i was then because of


---------86:46----------
this


---------86:46----------
this like 4d like you know


---------86:50----------
time eternity that we have but natalie


---------86:53----------
okay so now i'm going to talk logically


---------86:56----------
and i'm going to express a little bit of


---------86:57----------
frustration


---------86:58----------
but i'm not frustrated at you i'm


---------87:00----------
frustrated with the part of you


---------87:02----------
that does this to yourself so the reason


---------87:05----------
that you're


---------87:06----------
afraid that the rest of the world will


---------87:07----------
judge you that way


---------87:09----------
is because you judge yourself that way


---------87:13----------
uh well i do but also other people too


---------87:17----------
yeah absolutely right but like the thing


---------87:20----------
is


---------87:21----------
is that like i don't know how else to


---------87:22----------
say this but if it's


---------87:24----------
if you're on the same team with the


---------87:27----------
toxicity of the internet


---------87:28----------
you're gonna [ __ ] lose yeah well you


---------87:31----------
need to be on


---------87:32----------
your team they can say whatever the [ __ ]


---------87:34----------
they want to


---------87:35----------
yeah but the cool thing is just like if


---------87:37----------
natalie three years ago


---------87:39----------
had you as a sister supporting her she


---------87:42----------
would be in a completely different place


---------87:45----------
and i can tell you that your ability to


---------87:47----------
stand against the toxicity of the


---------87:48----------
internet


---------87:49----------
is going to be transformed if you can


---------87:51----------
stand with yourself


---------87:53----------
yeah you're damn right you're right


---------87:55----------
because you're [ __ ] smart and that's


---------87:56----------
half your problem


---------87:58----------
that they will continue to hate on the


---------88:01----------
question is


---------88:02----------
do you want to join them


---------88:05----------
well that is the problem isn't it


---------88:07----------
because like because i feel that


---------88:09----------
so many times i have essentially


---------88:12----------
joined in yes with those people like i


---------88:16----------
take their voice into my own head and it


---------88:18----------
becomes like


---------88:19----------
part of me and it becomes my own


---------88:21----------
perspective yeah so i think you've got


---------88:23----------
to


---------88:23----------
be careful a little bit about where


---------88:25----------
you're giving credit you said you take


---------88:26----------
their voice into your own head which you


---------88:28----------
do


---------88:29----------
but you had that voice before they did


---------88:32----------
that's true yeah right so be careful


---------88:35----------
yeah and so if we're thinking about your


---------88:37----------
agency and empowering you


---------88:40----------
it starts with the acceptance that this


---------88:43----------
voice is not


---------88:44----------
sure they reinforced that they fanned


---------88:45----------
the flames they threw fertilizer on it


---------88:48----------
like call it whatever you want to i'm


---------88:49----------
not saying that that's positive


---------88:51----------
but i think you have way more power up


---------88:54----------
in the way that you look at yourself


---------88:57----------
than the internet does


---------88:59----------
yeah well that's that should be true


---------89:03----------
uh i mean i i guess it is technically


---------89:05----------
true because


---------89:06----------
you know then there's a limit to how


---------89:08----------
powerful the internet can be in


---------89:10----------
effect affecting me but uh yeah it's


---------89:13----------
like as a question is like


---------89:14----------
how where i'm gonna find that


---------89:17----------
compassion um because i i sort of had an


---------89:20----------
awareness for a long time


---------89:22----------
that like this is this this is something


---------89:24----------
that's missing it's


---------89:25----------
it's something that i feel like if i


---------89:27----------
could if i could find this if i could


---------89:29----------
create this


---------89:30----------
i would be much stronger and i would


---------89:32----------
have a lot more fun online frankly


---------89:34----------
yeah because yeah all this all this


---------89:36----------
awfulness commentary


---------89:37----------
dummy i mean it could be sort of just


---------89:41----------
brushed off as the sort of amusing


---------89:43----------
ridiculous


---------89:44----------
nonsense that it is um


---------89:47----------
the like the weird hate obsession that


---------89:49----------
other people have is that that is simply


---------89:50----------
not my problem


---------89:52----------
right um it's a question of like


---------89:55----------
i just can't seem to get to the point


---------89:58----------
where i genuinely don't care and when


---------90:01----------
where there's not still this part of me


---------90:02----------
that's


---------90:03----------
on their side yep so so well said okay


---------90:06----------
so


---------90:06----------
like here's your quarter unquote answer


---------90:09----------
so the first thing is that


---------90:11----------
you did it today i'm pretty sure i heard


---------90:14----------
compassion come out of you that was not


---------90:17----------
there before


---------90:18----------
and i think it's the way that and so i'd


---------90:21----------
say just go back


---------90:22----------
and like evoke those feelings and then


---------90:24----------
just ask yourself pretend that you're oh


---------90:26----------
you're your own older sister yeah right


---------90:29----------
and like how would you talk


---------90:31----------
to your how would you talk to that


---------90:33----------
person who's stuck in time


---------90:34----------
now you're sort of lucky because like


---------90:36----------
that person is still preserved right so


---------90:38----------
you can like actually kind of go back in


---------90:40----------
time and like talk to them


---------90:41----------
i think that literally that exercise


---------90:44----------
towards yourself so like i'd say like


---------90:46----------
another thing you can do is


---------90:47----------
imagine that time that you had you know


---------90:49----------
nail polish on


---------90:50----------
and like you went and you saw someone on


---------90:52----------
the subway who was like


---------90:54----------
one of these ugly transsexuals


---------90:57----------
yeah and and just like you know just


---------91:00----------
just walk yourself through


---------91:02----------
and like listen to the way that you


---------91:03----------
thought about your like you you thought


---------91:05----------
about that person


---------91:06----------
try to explore that feeling and then


---------91:07----------
like talk to yourself


---------91:09----------
now right and and that gets more


---------91:12----------
complicated that's the barrier by the


---------91:14----------
way


---------91:14----------
we hit that barrier and you can see it


---------91:16----------
if you go once again go back and watch


---------91:18----------
the vod


---------91:19----------
there's there was a new thinking and


---------91:20----------
then i saw the old thinking kind of crop


---------91:22----------
up


---------91:24----------
yeah and so you just gotta i mean you


---------91:26----------
gotta work at it right so i'd say like


---------91:28----------
just


---------91:28----------
just learn how to talk to yourself so


---------91:30----------
you're gonna you're gonna figure out you


---------91:31----------
know


---------91:32----------
level one you can talk to yourself from


---------91:33----------
three years ago level two


---------91:35----------
maybe five years ago you just have to


---------91:36----------
practice


---------91:38----------
the second thing oh [ __ ] something else


---------91:41----------
oh yeah the second thing is that


---------91:43----------
i think just in general


---------91:46----------
the more that you can accept


---------91:50----------
that you were a toxic [ __ ]


---------91:53----------
and the more that you can accept that


---------91:55----------
just like all the other toxic [ __ ]


---------91:57----------
on the internet


---------91:58----------
your toxicity actually comes from hurt


---------92:02----------
it doesn't come from you being a bad


---------92:03----------
person and the more because right now


---------92:05----------
what happens


---------92:06----------
you judge yourself for being the [ __ ]


---------92:08----------
right


---------92:09----------
you're like oh i used to be bad like


---------92:11----------
that and i try not to and stuff like


---------92:13----------
that


---------92:13----------
what i want you to do is is follow that


---------92:16----------
pull on that thread


---------92:17----------
back to its source hurt and once you


---------92:20----------
find that source hurt


---------92:22----------
then you can express compassion towards


---------92:24----------
it i think the reason you can't be


---------92:25----------
compassionate towards yourself is


---------92:26----------
because i don't think you've tracked


---------92:27----------
back


---------92:27----------
to the actual wound


---------92:31----------
so follow the thread of hatred back to


---------92:33----------
the wound


---------92:35----------
just like incels right like go back to


---------92:37----------
that rejection


---------92:39----------
and like like then then you can be


---------92:42----------
compassionate if you know like what


---------92:43----------
hurts


---------92:47----------
yeah i think um you don't know how to


---------92:49----------
kiss the boo-boo because you don't know


---------92:50----------
where the boo-boo is


---------92:52----------
yeah i think it's hard to place exactly


---------92:54----------
like where it starts it's more of a damn


---------92:56----------
right it is


---------92:57----------
yes yeah like a couple of things come to


---------93:01----------
mind but i don't know


---------93:02----------
like i don't know what the origin is


---------93:04----------
exactly yeah so but


---------93:05----------
natalie that's what you've got to


---------93:06----------
explore right and this is the thing it


---------93:08----------
doesn't have a origin


---------93:09----------
so if you get a chance to go back and


---------93:11----------
watch if i have a video about some scars


---------93:13----------
you should just go back and watch that


---------93:15----------
but the thing is each of these so that


---------93:17----------
hurt it's that's actually the


---------93:19----------
beautiful answer that makes me more


---------93:21----------
optimistic so the way


---------93:22----------
so i think what's what's going on this


---------93:23----------
is some scar so some scar is a sanskrit


---------93:26----------
word that means a ball of undigested


---------93:28----------
emotion or an emotional trauma


---------93:30----------
and essentially what happens is that we


---------93:32----------
carry around this ball of undigested


---------93:34----------
emotion with us


---------93:36----------
and every experience that we have that


---------93:39----------
sort of relates to it


---------93:41----------
grows the size of that emotional trauma


---------93:44----------
and so when you're saying i don't know


---------93:46----------
where it starts the way that you fix it


---------93:48----------
is by going through each of those the


---------93:50----------
more things that you can think of


---------93:52----------
conversely actually the easier it's


---------93:53----------
going to be to heal because each of


---------93:55----------
those needs to be processed


---------93:58----------
sort of with me i'm going to give you an


---------93:59----------
example in a second yeah yeah


---------94:01----------
so if if we think about like let's say i


---------94:04----------
have a phobia of dogs right like that


---------94:06----------
phobia of dog starts with one dog biting


---------94:08----------
me


---------94:09----------
and then what happens if i get bitten


---------94:11----------
again what happens to my phobia


---------94:14----------
is it confirmed confirmed right yeah and


---------94:17----------
then


---------94:18----------
if i get bitten the third time fourth


---------94:19----------
time fifth time the more


---------94:21----------
experiences i can think of of dogs


---------94:23----------
biting me the greater the emotional


---------94:26----------
trauma is and so interestingly if you


---------94:28----------
can think of a handful of things then


---------94:30----------
you need to go back


---------94:31----------
and talk through each of those right we


---------94:34----------
think like okay that first time that dog


---------94:36----------
bit you it actually didn't bite you the


---------94:37----------
second time this happened


---------94:38----------
the third time this happened and you go


---------94:40----------
back and you process each of those and


---------94:42----------
then


---------94:43----------
natalie you'll feel it you'll do it it's


---------94:46----------
actually i


---------94:46----------
i can't i feel really optimistic for you


---------94:51----------
because if you can already think of a


---------94:52----------
bunch of things that's because


---------94:54----------
each of those things relates to that


---------94:56----------
some scar


---------94:57----------
right why does your mind think of like


---------95:00----------
like if i say the word sushi and your


---------95:02----------
mind thinks about six different kinds of


---------95:04----------
sushi that's because it's all related to


---------95:06----------
that core concept


---------95:09----------
so i'd say if you've done therapy you


---------95:11----------
know go through each of those


---------95:12----------
experiences and really think about


---------95:14----------
what hurt about this where does my anger


---------95:18----------
come from


---------95:19----------
and track them back and then you'll find


---------95:20----------
this ball


---------95:22----------
of like amorphous relatively undigested


---------95:25----------
emotion


---------95:26----------
that sprouts and pokes through the


---------95:29----------
ground


---------95:30----------
in several places but just because you


---------95:32----------
see a lot of different shoots


---------95:34----------
doesn't make your life harder it


---------95:35----------
actually makes your life easier


---------95:38----------
yeah well


---------95:41----------
i i can say yeah i guess


---------95:45----------
you think you could just describe to me


---------95:47----------
like what it would look like to process


---------95:48----------
like an individual one of these


---------95:50----------
incidents sure so give me an example


---------95:53----------
what's one of the things that you


---------95:55----------
thought about um


---------95:57----------
well okay this is like not necessarily


---------96:01----------
one of the earliest but i guess sometime


---------96:04----------
was the first six months or seven months


---------96:06----------
of my transition


---------96:09----------
i can recall like basically like going


---------96:12----------
into


---------96:13----------
a restaurant and like trying to get a


---------96:15----------
table


---------96:16----------
and having them just like straight up


---------96:18----------
laugh at me and be like


---------96:21----------
lol like this like like


---------96:25----------
this is like a crazy cross-dresser like


---------96:27----------
i forgot exactly what they said but it


---------96:29----------
but it was um you know


---------96:32----------
so there's that or they think there's


---------96:33----------
like the time


---------96:35----------
well hold on a second okay sorry keep


---------96:38----------
going keep going sorry


---------96:39----------
like another time i was walking down uh


---------96:43----------
the street and like early on and like


---------96:46----------
some got like it was a guy who was


---------96:48----------
following me


---------96:49----------
and sorry this is like a little bit


---------96:51----------
explicit


---------96:53----------
but he just came up right behind me and


---------96:55----------
said


---------96:57----------
would you mind if i sucked your dick


---------97:00----------
like


---------97:01----------
what is the point of that except to make


---------97:03----------
him make it to


---------97:04----------
he wants me to know that he knows that


---------97:07----------
i'm trans


---------97:08----------
and also he wants me to feel degraded


---------97:09----------
about it


---------97:12----------
okay i don't know why he said that it's


---------97:13----------
a weird thing to say but i completely


---------97:15----------
agree


---------97:16----------
but but like there's a couple


---------97:18----------
experiences like like


---------97:20----------
a bunch of experiences like that where


---------97:21----------
it's like well people like


---------97:24----------
there's sort of people they want me to


---------97:27----------
know that they know that i'm trans


---------97:29----------
they don't want me to get away with


---------97:31----------
thinking that


---------97:32----------
that people see me as a woman and


---------97:36----------
they also like want me to feel bad about


---------97:38----------
it and they succeed at that


---------97:42----------
okay


---------97:46----------
can i think for a second yeah yeah


---------98:04----------
so if people are wondering that's the


---------98:06----------
sump scar


---------98:09----------
so it's this this whole okay


---------98:12----------
so let's just look at something


---------98:13----------
logically for a second okay


---------98:15----------
and i'm i'm gonna try to unpack


---------98:17----------
something but like it's okay you don't


---------98:19----------
have to


---------98:20----------
i'm gonna point out logical


---------98:22----------
inconsistencies i don't want you to


---------98:23----------
defend them


---------98:24----------
because i think that's a sign that we're


---------98:25----------
moving in the right direction


---------98:27----------
so the guy who walks up to you and says


---------98:28----------
do you want me to suck your dick


---------98:30----------
and then you say he wants me to feel dot


---------98:33----------
dot dot dot dot


---------98:34----------
and then like literally is you


---------98:35----------
hypothesized two reasons


---------98:37----------
why he did that and then and then


---------98:40----------
literally in the next sentence you're


---------98:41----------
like i have no idea why someone would


---------98:43----------
say that


---------98:46----------
yeah well i just think it's a weird way


---------98:48----------
of getting


---------98:49----------
those things across well but so that's


---------98:51----------
the thing is i don't know


---------98:53----------
where you get the idea of what he was


---------98:55----------
trying to get across


---------98:57----------
so you may have some insight that i


---------98:59----------
don't have


---------99:01----------
and i'm sure you do right because you've


---------99:02----------
been on the receiving end of a lot of


---------99:04----------
these interactions


---------99:05----------
but i think it when you say they don't


---------99:09----------
want me to get away with it


---------99:11----------
i think that's like


---------99:14----------
natalie do you think you're getting away


---------99:16----------
with it


---------99:18----------
get away with what you tell me what were


---------99:20----------
you referring to


---------99:23----------
well i guess


---------99:27----------
nice dodge but what i feel is that


---------99:30----------
they're trying to do


---------99:31----------
is that they're kind of trying to


---------99:33----------
humiliate me


---------99:35----------
by making sure i know that they are


---------99:38----------
clocking me


---------99:39----------
as like a transgender person


---------99:42----------
you know what i mean like hey like no


---------99:44----------
one sees you you know


---------99:45----------
i don't see you as a woman like just so


---------99:46----------
you know do you see yourself as a woman


---------99:48----------
natalie


---------99:50----------
uh well i kind of go back and forth kind


---------99:52----------
of um


---------99:53----------
there it is yeah right so like


---------99:56----------
i don't think i mean i could be wrong


---------99:59----------
right so you've dealt with more toxicity


---------100:01----------
towards transgender people than i have


---------100:04----------
you know sucks for you and so you


---------100:07----------
probably have a better understanding of


---------100:09----------
what's in their head than i do


---------100:11----------
but i'm gonna go out on limb and say


---------100:13----------
you're really


---------100:15----------
frankly could be projecting a lot of


---------100:18----------
their motivations


---------100:19----------
because when i ask you because like


---------100:21----------
here's here's the


---------100:22----------
crazy thing right that's the [ __ ] sub


---------100:24----------
scar he said they don't want me to get


---------100:26----------
away with it and i ask you


---------100:27----------
natalie are you a woman and


---------100:30----------
the way i'm going to interpret your


---------100:32----------
answer is that i really want to be


---------100:34----------
but i'm not sure that i'm getting away


---------100:35----------
with it


---------100:38----------
yeah i think that well so i i see what


---------100:40----------
you're saying


---------100:41----------
and that i do think that like if i was


---------100:44----------
like 100


---------100:45----------
confident i know who i am like i know


---------100:48----------
that i'm a woman


---------100:49----------
like nothing anyone else thinks can


---------100:50----------
change that then this would not bother


---------100:52----------
me to the extent that it does right


---------100:54----------
precisely it's the fact that it's


---------100:57----------
picking at


---------100:59----------
what is already an insecurity exam


---------101:02----------
right that's the sum scar so that's why


---------101:04----------
when a random person who


---------101:07----------
you know who knows what the [ __ ] he was


---------101:09----------
thinking because


---------101:10----------
it sounds like a real perv but when when


---------101:12----------
you can take


---------101:13----------
and granted you can assume some things


---------101:15----------
about you know what they're thinking but


---------101:16----------
like


---------101:17----------
i think generally speaking like that


---------101:19----------
behavior is so


---------101:20----------
far outside the norm that i would


---------101:23----------
conclude that you


---------101:24----------
can't actual like your capacity to


---------101:27----------
imagine what that person is thinking is


---------101:28----------
actually quite low maybe


---------101:30----------
could be different for you but but i


---------101:31----------
think what happens is ambiguous


---------101:34----------
ambiguous interactions small


---------101:36----------
interactions short interactions


---------101:38----------
like you walking in and they're them


---------101:39----------
laughing like do you even know that they


---------101:41----------
were laughing at you i know it sounds


---------101:42----------
like a crazy question


---------101:44----------
well sometimes you're not really sure


---------101:48----------
but sometimes but sometimes sometimes


---------101:50----------
like it's they're looking at you in a


---------101:51----------
way that it's like


---------101:53----------
it seems like that they could be


---------101:55----------
laughing at you for some other reason


---------101:56----------
but


---------101:57----------
but like what else would it be


---------102:00----------
exactly right so so i i think so that's


---------102:03----------
the thing is i


---------102:04----------
once again natalie i'm hopeful because


---------102:05----------
you're insightful this is your insecure


---------102:08----------
it's not coming from other people so


---------102:10----------
then the question that


---------102:11----------
now we have to go to the root of it is


---------102:13----------
like like where


---------102:14----------
when did you start to think that you


---------102:17----------
wouldn't get away with it


---------102:20----------
um well i guess what do we mean by


---------102:23----------
getting away with it as in like


---------102:25----------
your language yeah so okay i i guess


---------102:28----------
part of what i'm talking about here is


---------102:29----------
like it's like


---------102:30----------
passing as a woman like having other


---------102:32----------
people see me and then just


---------102:35----------
pick up okay that's a woman you know uh


---------102:38----------
i guess to me well especially the the


---------102:41----------
perfect example


---------102:42----------
like because it's because like sometimes


---------102:44----------
people apart from me just the way that


---------102:46----------
they perform on


---------102:47----------
any woman you know and that doesn't


---------102:48----------
bother me


---------102:50----------
because it's like because it's like well


---------102:51----------
yeah because you're passing


---------102:53----------
right that's what they do but like they


---------102:56----------
do that's all


---------102:57----------
to most of them they're to a lot of


---------102:58----------
women and so it's like okay it's not the


---------103:01----------
greatest thing but it also doesn't


---------103:02----------
really needle me in the same way


---------103:04----------
but it was the way this guy did it


---------103:06----------
specifically as a reference to the fact


---------103:08----------
that i'm trans


---------103:10----------
yeah you know what i mean and so it's


---------103:13----------
part of it


---------103:13----------
i guess in a way like part of the pain


---------103:15----------
is like it's regardless of the fact


---------103:18----------
that regardless of


---------103:21----------
of of what he was trying to do


---------103:24----------
what he said is still revealing that


---------103:27----------
like he got me


---------103:28----------
you know yeah so yeah but so i i think


---------103:32----------
that he can


---------103:32----------
only get you if you don't if you're


---------103:35----------
hiding something


---------103:37----------
yeah right yeah


---------103:40----------
it's true that like it and i think this


---------103:43----------
is an area where i've made some


---------103:44----------
progress like you've made a lot of


---------103:47----------
progress


---------103:48----------
you're allowed i'm allowed to be


---------103:52----------
a trans woman and part of that is i'm


---------103:54----------
allowed to look like a trans woman


---------103:56----------
absolutely um and like but for a while


---------103:59----------
that seemed like


---------104:00----------
so unacceptable it was like no like if i


---------104:02----------
look like a trans woman like


---------104:04----------
this is failure like this is like


---------104:06----------
equivalent to looking


---------104:08----------
like ugly and unlovable blah blah blah


---------104:09----------
blah blah like


---------104:11----------
and so it became this whole painful


---------104:15----------
thing yeah yeah


---------104:16----------
but i mean that's what that's it natalie


---------104:18----------
yeah


---------104:19----------
so like it's like going back in time and


---------104:21----------
like examining


---------104:23----------
those thoughts the thoughts of


---------104:26----------
i feel like a failure right so and i


---------104:28----------
think i think you're right you've come a


---------104:30----------
long way but the problem is that like


---------104:32----------
even though you've learned how to make a


---------104:36----------
really delicious dinner


---------104:37----------
you still have you haven't taken out the


---------104:40----------
trash from the failed attempts before


---------104:43----------
right right and so i think that there's


---------104:45----------
still a lot there about like


---------104:46----------
what you need to accept yourself as and


---------104:48----------
i you know maybe i'm rubbing people the


---------104:50----------
wrong way here but like


---------104:51----------
i think you've got to accept yourself as


---------104:52----------
who you are which is a trans woman


---------104:55----------
which like i mean maybe this is


---------104:57----------
offensive and please let me know if it


---------104:58----------
is but like


---------104:59----------
if you are holding yourself up to a


---------105:02----------
beauty standard that involves two


---------105:04----------
x chromosomes yeah that's just like


---------105:08----------
a battle that's gonna be hard to win and


---------105:11----------
even if you do win it someday which i


---------105:13----------
hope you do and great for you


---------105:15----------
you still can't really it's like just


---------105:16----------
not fair to beat yourself up for like


---------105:18----------
losing all of the attempts until


---------105:22----------
you know someone injects you with a


---------105:23----------
virus that replaces your y chromosome


---------105:25----------
with an x chromosome or something like


---------105:26----------
that


---------105:26----------
and then you're like you know like like


---------105:29----------
i mean you are who you


---------105:30----------
are right yeah and and for a long time


---------105:33----------
and i think that's sort of the antidote


---------105:35----------
to it but i think you still have to


---------105:36----------
take out the trash which is to go back


---------105:38----------
to all those times where you were


---------105:40----------
hunting


---------105:41----------
right you were expressing yourself at


---------105:44----------
first you were


---------105:44----------
hiding a woman in the man's body and you


---------105:47----------
were hiding it being


---------105:48----------
a man right and then your girlfriend


---------105:51----------
dumped you because you weren't masculine


---------105:52----------
enough


---------105:53----------
right and so so like you've been hiding


---------105:56----------
your entire life and i think it just


---------105:57----------
goes back to like each of those


---------105:59----------
experiences and talking those through


---------106:02----------
right processing them and recognizing


---------106:04----------
that i've been trying to hide who i


---------106:06----------
am for way longer than i'm pretending to


---------106:09----------
be a woman i don't mean that


---------106:11----------
offensively but like i think i'm putting


---------106:13----------
myself in your shoes


---------106:15----------
because i think you sometimes still


---------106:16----------
think that you are pretending to be a


---------106:18----------
woman


---------106:20----------
yeah no i i agree that with that or at


---------106:22----------
least that i'm pretending to be like


---------106:25----------
i'm i'm sort of i'm getting this great


---------106:28----------
sense of security


---------106:30----------
from the idea that people are just


---------106:32----------
perceiving me as like a biological woman


---------106:34----------
yeah you know what i mean like the


---------106:36----------
people are not noticing any transness


---------106:38----------
about me is it this great sense of


---------106:40----------
comfort


---------106:41----------
and like i do still have this experience


---------106:44----------
where like


---------106:45----------
okay so here's something that happens


---------106:46----------
time to time like if i meet a new person


---------106:49----------
like and they don't know what i do they


---------106:52----------
don't know anything about me


---------106:53----------
everything seems to be going well and


---------106:55----------
then they ask like oh like what's your


---------106:57----------
what was your job and i'm like i


---------107:00----------
do internet media


---------107:03----------
they want to know okay explicit oh my


---------107:05----------
god i'm a youtuber and they say what's


---------107:07----------
your channel about oh you have to tell


---------107:08----------
me so i can google it right now


---------107:10----------
and then like i'll tell them and then as


---------107:13----------
they google my name


---------107:15----------
i will just like like i can feel my face


---------107:17----------
get like hot with the shame


---------107:19----------
of knowing that what they're about to


---------107:20----------
find out yeah


---------107:22----------
so that's coming from you friend yeah


---------107:26----------
it's not coming i mean as much as those


---------107:27----------
toxic [ __ ] on the internet think


---------107:29----------
that they have power over you like i


---------107:31----------
just don't think


---------107:32----------
i mean sure they can hurt you don't get


---------107:34----------
me wrong


---------107:35----------
but like that's the shame that is like


---------107:37----------
it's the anticipatory shame


---------107:40----------
of them knowing yeah right and you're


---------107:43----------
right because it's security but like


---------107:45----------
this is this it goes back to courage


---------107:46----------
natalie yeah security is about like


---------107:50----------
hiding from them something about


---------107:53----------
yourself


---------107:54----------
because you're afraid like why is that


---------107:56----------
secure for you because


---------107:58----------
you're afraid of what they'll see


---------108:01----------
and how they'll react and like why is


---------108:04----------
that and like that's because it goes i


---------108:06----------
think that goes back to like


---------108:07----------
how you used to react yeah


---------108:11----------
what you see in them is like yeah and


---------108:13----------
and so


---------108:14----------
i think it's like it's like i mean i


---------108:15----------
don't know how to say this but it's all


---------108:16----------
this crap like we can't


---------108:18----------
unfortunately we can't do it all today


---------108:20----------
but i think these are the threads you've


---------108:22----------
got to run down right like your own


---------108:23----------
toxicity towards other people the way


---------108:25----------
that you used to judge them


---------108:26----------
because that's the way you judge


---------108:27----------
yourself yes


---------108:30----------
it's it's about like learning that


---------108:32----------
you're going to be a trans woman for the


---------108:34----------
rest of your life


---------108:35----------
yes and i i don't think yeah no that's


---------108:38----------
like that's something that i recently


---------108:40----------
had


---------108:40----------
like it's kind of because i'm you know


---------108:43----------
i'm


---------108:44----------
with like almost three and a half


---------108:46----------
something like that years into medical


---------108:48----------
and social transition and like i i'm at


---------108:50----------
a point where


---------108:52----------
i've sort of dispelled this illusion i


---------108:54----------
guess from earlier on


---------108:56----------
earlier on it there's there's almost a


---------108:57----------
delusion that takes hold that's like oh


---------108:59----------
i'm going to get to the end of this and


---------109:01----------
i'm just going to be a cis woman


---------109:03----------
but it's like no i'm not like i'm kind


---------109:05----------
of


---------109:06----------
so so here's here's the problem


---------109:09----------
right so like i'm not an expert in


---------109:11----------
political theory or sociology


---------109:13----------
if i say something that's offensive i


---------109:15----------
apologize


---------109:16----------
here's what i see as a problem and


---------109:18----------
you're welcome to think i'm wrong


---------109:21----------
if you don't accept yourself as a trans


---------109:23----------
woman


---------109:24----------
you're placing a value on cis women over


---------109:27----------
trans women


---------109:29----------
oh 100 yeah right and so that's i think


---------109:32----------
the basic problem is that like you are


---------109:34----------
valuing something above yourself that


---------109:36----------
you will never be


---------109:38----------
yeah and impossible and then you're


---------109:40----------
confused why despite your material


---------109:42----------
success you were unhappy


---------109:45----------
yeah right


---------109:48----------
well yeah and and so like natalie like


---------109:51----------
it comes to like


---------109:52----------
accepting who you are and accepting that


---------109:56----------
you know like there are a lot of parts


---------109:58----------
of you that are ugly and you hate


---------109:59----------
yourself and whatever but like i think


---------110:01----------
you've got to go back and and just


---------110:03----------
i mean that's the thing until you accept


---------110:05----------
yourself


---------110:06----------
for who you are right and you can still


---------110:10----------
like want to be more feminine but once


---------110:13----------
again it's like that has to come from


---------110:15----------
you and that has to come from like


---------110:16----------
forward momentum it's like you're like


---------110:18----------
the person who


---------110:18----------
wants to lose 50 pounds and has lost 30


---------110:21----------
pounds and you're beating yourself up


---------110:23----------
because you still need to lose 20 more


---------110:25----------
like it's going to be a journey


---------110:27----------
yeah and i don't think at least in this


---------110:29----------
life you're ever going to be a cis woman


---------110:31----------
we'll see


---------110:32----------
but the thing is i don't think that


---------110:33----------
there's a problem with that


---------110:35----------
yeah right i think it's like if you


---------110:38----------
think there's a problem with that that's


---------110:39----------
on you


---------110:41----------
but if you think it's a problem with it


---------110:42----------
that's not something that's ever gonna


---------110:44----------
i mean maybe medic who knows right well


---------110:47----------
i feel that it's like


---------110:48----------
i feel that it's something i sort of


---------110:50----------
just i mean there are trends the one who


---------110:52----------
kind of say like oh i'm not even trans


---------110:53----------
anymore i've had all the surgeries like


---------110:55----------
like but i don't know i think that i


---------110:57----------
don't quite agree with that i think that


---------110:59----------
like


---------110:59----------
there's no erasing who where you come


---------111:02----------
from


---------111:03----------
and i guess natalie do you try


---------111:08----------
yeah well sure i do especially i mean


---------111:10----------
like not all the time i don't try


---------111:12----------
all the time and i'm like aware that


---------111:13----------
online like in like come on


---------111:15----------
the game is up people know that i'm


---------111:16----------
trans like but but it's true that


---------111:19----------
that like offline i do try


---------111:22----------
to keep people from knowing okay a lot


---------111:24----------
of the time


---------111:25----------
and like and i guess on some level i


---------111:32----------
i there's also a regret almost at the


---------111:34----------
time on the internet it's like well


---------111:36----------
i might have had a chance to just kind


---------111:38----------
of blend in and just not have to deal


---------111:40----------
with any of this


---------111:41----------
if i hadn't made this so public yeah


---------111:44----------
so the regret is once again about the


---------111:46----------
security it's about the mask


---------111:48----------
your regret is that like you let people


---------111:51----------
know who you are


---------111:53----------
yeah if your regret would have won you


---------111:55----------
would be living a life that is


---------111:56----------
inauthentic and you'd be happy and


---------111:58----------
unhappy anyway that's true yeah it's


---------112:01----------
hard to really but like you've got to


---------112:02----------
just


---------112:03----------
swim in that [ __ ] yeah


---------112:07----------
well i know like for some as trans


---------112:08----------
people like that like it's called on


---------112:10----------
like


---------112:11----------
we call it living stealth which is when


---------112:13----------
you're living


---------112:15----------
you're not out as trans the people


---------112:17----------
around you people just think that


---------112:19----------
you know if you're trans women people


---------112:20----------
just think you're a woman they don't


---------112:21----------
know about your trans history


---------112:23----------
um so i think part of the i think


---------112:26----------
because i've heard from a lot of people


---------112:27----------
who live that way


---------112:28----------
that it actually kind of eats away at


---------112:29----------
them in its own way


---------112:31----------
because they're keeping this major part


---------112:33----------
of them with other people


---------112:35----------
i think part of my issue is that i never


---------112:37----------
have lived like


---------112:38----------
stealth except in these like little


---------112:40----------
isolated incidents where i'm like


---------112:42----------
i'm enjoying the fact that i've just met


---------112:44----------
this person and they don't seem to know


---------112:46----------
yet


---------112:46----------
you know um but like i i think that


---------112:50----------
because i don't have that experience of


---------112:51----------
living as stealth


---------112:53----------
i guess i feel like


---------112:56----------
i don't know i wish i had like at least


---------112:58----------
more of that and maybe if i did have


---------112:59----------
more of that


---------113:00----------
then i would realize that it's not that


---------113:02----------
great and i wouldn't care you know


---------113:04----------
so natalie i you know this may be i


---------113:07----------
don't even know what the statement is


---------113:08----------
gonna do


---------113:08----------
i didn't realize you were a trans woman


---------113:10----------
when i watched your youtube video


---------113:12----------
i don't know how that's going to affect


---------113:13----------
you like how does that make you feel if


---------113:15----------
i tell you that


---------113:16----------
i love it anyway


---------113:20----------
i know i'm not supposed to know and i


---------113:22----------
was supposed to love it but it makes me


---------113:23----------
feel really good


---------113:24----------
okay so so forget about what you're


---------113:27----------
supposed to do


---------113:27----------
yeah like why like i'm telling you


---------113:31----------
to you know so you can look at yourself


---------113:34----------
and like


---------113:34----------
what feels satisfied well it feels like


---------113:38----------
um


---------113:40----------
i guess it feels like you saw me


---------113:43----------
the way i kind of want to be seen


---------113:47----------
okay and now i know you're a trans woman


---------113:50----------
yeah how do you feel


---------113:54----------
uh i mean it's fine


---------113:57----------
most people know but like but i guess


---------114:00----------
it's um


---------114:01----------
it does i feel ch change a little bit i


---------114:04----------
feel like it must change it must change


---------114:07----------
how you see me


---------114:08----------
somewhat look at my face


---------114:12----------
what do you see what do i think about


---------114:14----------
you


---------114:16----------
oh i don't know try


---------114:19----------
i mean you invited me on your show sure


---------114:22----------
couldn't hear me that much but i i


---------114:23----------
didn't know you were trans when we


---------114:25----------
invited you on our show


---------114:27----------
yeah uh well i guess


---------114:33----------
natalie look at my face and tell me what


---------114:36----------
what i think about what do you see in my


---------114:38----------
face


---------114:40----------
um well i i think i think you're


---------114:44----------
interested


---------114:45----------
and and you care what i have to say


---------114:49----------
okay good both true anything else yeah


---------114:53----------
uh i mean okay you don't seem like


---------114:57----------
you don't you don't seem too disgusted


---------115:02----------
what do you think about that um


---------115:04----------
[Music]


---------115:05----------
it's nice yeah so when you say something


---------115:09----------
must have changed what must have changed


---------115:14----------
well i guess it comes from this fear


---------115:17----------
that


---------115:18----------
like if people know that i'm trans


---------115:21----------
they're gonna like re-categorize me as


---------115:24----------
like


---------115:25----------
okay probably like


---------115:29----------
i don't know some kind of abnormal


---------115:31----------
deviant instead of just


---------115:33----------
and we're trying to know like why why do


---------115:34----------
i care so much about people think of an


---------115:36----------
abnormal deviant i haven't had normal


---------115:37----------
deviation like


---------115:38----------
i don't i don't know i don't know yeah


---------115:40----------
so much because


---------115:41----------
because like it comes from you man yeah


---------115:44----------
and hopefully that's not offensive


---------115:48----------
i just don't know i just don't know like


---------115:51----------
i don't know


---------115:51----------
i want you to understand why i have this


---------115:53----------
like conformist streak


---------115:55----------
that comes out about this particular


---------115:57----------
issue when a lot of other ways i'm not


---------115:58----------
really that conformist


---------116:00----------
yeah so like like here's the thing


---------116:02----------
natalie you were a complicated


---------116:04----------
bundle of all kinds of [ __ ] some would


---------116:07----------
be good and some of it bad


---------116:09----------
and i accept all of it


---------116:13----------
whatever there's a part of you that's a


---------116:15----------
toxic castle


---------116:16----------
fine there's a part of you that's


---------116:18----------
brilliant and a good teacher fine


---------116:19----------
there's a part of you that's a trans


---------116:21----------
woman fine there's a part of you that's


---------116:23----------
just a woman


---------116:24----------
without cis without trans without


---------116:27----------
anything else


---------116:28----------
fine but you're you yeah


---------116:32----------
and like every part of you that i've


---------116:35----------
seen i think is great


---------116:38----------
right like you're just you and like you


---------116:40----------
keep on doing you


---------116:42----------
and don't worry about like you know like


---------116:45----------
because when i tell you like


---------116:46----------
when we explore my understanding of


---------116:50----------
whether you're trans or not


---------116:52----------
it like it comes from your head because


---------116:54----------
you've been talking to me the whole time


---------116:56----------
i've known your trans


---------116:57----------
sort of the whole time right but it's


---------116:59----------
like even when i share with you like


---------117:00----------
so you've had a particular impression of


---------117:02----------
people when we start


---------117:04----------
talking about my beliefs about whether


---------117:06----------
you're trans or not


---------117:07----------
this whole other complex arises in your


---------117:09----------
mind do you see that


---------117:11----------
yeah whereas we've been talking for like


---------117:13----------
two hours and like


---------117:16----------
i mean i don't know if it's been there


---------117:17----------
or not but i haven't noticed it until


---------117:18----------
now


---------117:19----------
which is like it's just weird it's a


---------117:21----------
whole separate thing


---------117:24----------
even it's like my preoccupation with


---------117:26----------
like how you're seeing me or


---------117:27----------
yes yes right and i i turned that switch


---------117:31----------
on


---------117:32----------
by telling you i didn't know you were


---------117:34----------
trans


---------117:35----------
yeah guys we've just been two humans


---------117:38----------
talking about


---------117:39----------
[ __ ] for the last two hours and like


---------117:41----------
it's been fun for me hopefully it's been


---------117:43----------
fun for you yeah


---------117:44----------
and then all i have to do is i have to


---------117:45----------
tell you i didn't know you were trans


---------117:46----------
because i really


---------117:47----------
i don't know and then as soon as that


---------117:50----------
like a switch turns on in your mind and


---------117:51----------
this whole complex


---------117:52----------
opens up but like that's just like some


---------117:54----------
weird psychological conditioning or


---------117:56----------
some scar it's not anything to do with


---------117:58----------
reality


---------117:59----------
does that make sense yeah i i mean no it


---------118:03----------
does i think


---------118:03----------
i think that this this question of like


---------118:07----------
whether i'm being perceived


---------118:09----------
as trans or whether i'm being perceived


---------118:11----------
as a woman or whatever having perceived


---------118:14----------
is like i mean it's maybe not as bad as


---------118:16----------
it used to be but for so


---------118:18----------
there was there was years where this was


---------118:19----------
just a constant preoccupation


---------118:22----------
and so it's very easy to like re-enter


---------118:24----------
that state of mind you're damn right it


---------118:26----------
is


---------118:26----------
yeah that is the some scars so each of


---------118:29----------
those moments that you remember


---------118:31----------
right you got to talk those through with


---------118:33----------
someone and i don't know if you


---------118:35----------
i don't know how much emotional


---------118:36----------
processing you've done since you asked


---------118:38----------
me how do i do that but i suspect a


---------118:39----------
little bit


---------118:40----------
so your tools are going to be like going


---------118:42----------
back thinking through that


---------118:45----------
trying to talk to yourself like your


---------118:47----------
older sister


---------118:48----------
you may evoke compassion maybe like a


---------118:50----------
shortcut to find you know what you


---------118:52----------
needed to tell yourself and


---------118:53----------
how to practice self-compassion which i


---------118:55----------
think everyone can do like one tool is


---------118:57----------
just pretend that you're the older


---------118:58----------
version of yourself


---------119:00----------
and i mean you know just going back in


---------119:02----------
time the third thing and i i kid you not


---------119:04----------
natalie is


---------119:05----------
just noticing is enough to transform


---------119:09----------
this is the biggest like misc


---------119:11----------
misunderstanding of the largely western


---------119:14----------
world


---------119:14----------
is that we think that doing something


---------119:16----------
enacts change


---------119:18----------
whereas the yogis in the east say


---------119:20----------
awareness of something is sufficient to


---------119:22----------
change it


---------119:25----------
and so i'd say just notice these


---------119:27----------
thoughts notice notice notice and when


---------119:29----------
you explore why do we say explore


---------119:31----------
why do we say emotionally processed we


---------119:32----------
are bringing things up from your mind


---------119:34----------
for you to notice and that is what


---------119:37----------
emotional processing is


---------119:38----------
it's kind of really bizarre but like you


---------119:40----------
know if you tell someone


---------119:43----------
hey you know i just lost a loved one and


---------119:45----------
that person says to you


---------119:47----------
hey i'm sorry that sucks is that person


---------119:50----------
alive


---------119:52----------
no no that thanks but like but why do


---------119:55----------
you feel better they didn't do anything


---------119:59----------
right all they did is acknowledge yeah


---------120:02----------
they


---------120:02----------
noticed your hurt and that in and of


---------120:04----------
itself is sufficient to reduce it


---------120:06----------
it's crazy but that's how it works


---------120:10----------
so that's my recommendation to you i


---------120:13----------
think that's maybe


---------120:14----------
kind of part of the hope and part of the


---------120:15----------
motivation for making the like the more


---------120:17----------
personal videos that i do


---------120:20----------
is like this this feeling that like oh


---------120:22----------
if i can share


---------120:23----------
if i can make up the other people see


---------120:25----------
the pain that i'm in


---------120:27----------
that will be some it will someone simply


---------120:29----------
relieve part of it


---------120:31----------
yeah so i makes sense to me but i think


---------120:33----------
this goes back to something you said at


---------120:34----------
the very beginning of the interview


---------120:36----------
which is that you're a confession junkie


---------120:38----------
yeah right and i i don't think it's


---------120:40----------
about sharing with the rest of the world


---------120:42----------
i think it's the reason that feels good


---------120:44----------
like why does confession


---------120:46----------
is because you're noticing it right like


---------120:48----------
you're accepting it you're bringing it


---------120:49----------
to the surface


---------120:50----------
you're not hiding it you're not masking


---------120:53----------
it you're


---------120:54----------
not stealthing anything you're just


---------120:57----------
being with it and then it gets easier


---------121:01----------
which is like i think anthropologically


---------121:03----------
like probably one of the reasons that


---------121:05----------
if you look at like a you know how


---------121:07----------
confession and things like that of all


---------121:09----------
that probably has something to do with


---------121:10----------
it


---------121:13----------
questions well i know like um


---------121:19----------
a lot of teenagers are kind of like


---------121:21----------
bullies


---------121:22----------
and then come to like later regret


---------121:25----------
or feel the horrible about having been


---------121:28----------
bullies like i've talked to a lot of


---------121:29----------
people like


---------121:30----------
like they look back on their teenagers


---------121:31----------
and they say like oh i was awful to


---------121:32----------
people


---------121:33----------
but it came from this space of like


---------121:37----------
of being hurt themselves and kind of i


---------121:40----------
don't know preferring to like


---------121:41----------
be on the side of the person doing the


---------121:42----------
hurting or something for once


---------121:45----------
i guess


---------121:49----------
sorry i was going with this


---------121:53----------
was the question you asked me huh


---------121:56----------
what was the question what was the


---------121:58----------
question you asked me i just said do you


---------121:59----------
have any questions


---------122:01----------
oh i guess um


---------122:16----------
i guess i feel like the one thing i


---------122:18----------
haven't mentioned


---------122:19----------
related to any of this stuff is that i


---------122:21----------
do feel that like


---------122:25----------
in a lot of subtle ways that these


---------122:26----------
problems have like


---------122:28----------
been behind some of the like uglier


---------122:30----------
moments in the time that i've been


---------122:32----------
online


---------122:33----------
yeah and i you know i


---------122:36----------
don't know how wary of as you are but


---------122:38----------
like a lot of


---------122:40----------
the like i make a fairly controversial


---------122:42----------
person


---------122:43----------
within trans spaces okay because of like


---------122:47----------
a lot of people are upset about some


---------122:48----------
like borderline transphobic things that


---------122:51----------
i've said in the past


---------122:52----------
and it's i i sort of i


---------122:57----------
i know that those the things that i said


---------123:00----------
that


---------123:01----------
that are contra i didn't say anything


---------123:03----------
too horrible but like it's something


---------123:04----------
that like


---------123:05----------
people kind of pick up on because in a


---------123:07----------
sense when they say that i'm transphobic


---------123:09----------
that they're right


---------123:10----------
like like i feel like if they're exactly


---------123:12----------
they're exact they're exaggerating


---------123:13----------
obviously they say they don't know the


---------123:14----------
mean way or they're trying to vilify me


---------123:15----------
but like they're they like they see the


---------123:18----------
same thing that you're seeing


---------123:19----------
you know and


---------123:23----------
i feel that and i feel that on some


---------123:24----------
level they're right that it has like


---------123:26----------
come out in these ways that are


---------123:27----------
sometimes


---------123:28----------
ugly and i guess i just don't i guess my


---------123:31----------
final thought is like


---------123:34----------
i wonder if there's any way to kind of


---------123:35----------
like undo some of the damage of that


---------123:40----------
sure of course


---------123:44----------
so so i i know it sounds like a simple


---------123:47----------
answer to what sounds like a heavy


---------123:48----------
question


---------123:49----------
but absolutely not so i think it starts


---------123:52----------
with what i'm hearing is that there's a


---------123:53----------
little bully in you


---------123:54----------
that sometimes is a little bit bullying


---------123:56----------
towards trans people


---------123:58----------
which we know because you bully the [ __ ]


---------123:59----------
out of yourself all the time


---------124:02----------
and and that it peaks out and then some


---------124:05----------
people from the trans community


---------124:06----------
blame you for it yeah which i don't


---------124:10----------
think you're


---------124:10----------
transphobic in the way that there's like


---------124:13----------
through transphobic people but


---------124:14----------
i'm not surprised that there are people


---------124:16----------
who are attuned


---------124:18----------
towards some of your negative attitudes


---------124:20----------
that fluctuate and peak out


---------124:23----------
in your content i think it's not


---------124:25----------
actually fair


---------124:26----------
or compassionate for them to like zero


---------124:29----------
in on those moments


---------124:31----------
in the larger scheme of your overall


---------124:34----------
thread


---------124:35----------
right i tend to be a pretty


---------124:36----------
compassionate guy sometimes i can be a


---------124:38----------
dick


---------124:39----------
and i think it's fair for people to


---------124:40----------
sniff that out


---------124:42----------
and like i'd also appreciate it if they


---------124:44----------
could you know look at


---------124:46----------
the scope of my things and judge me for


---------124:48----------
all of it


---------124:49----------
that's what i want to yeah yeah so i


---------124:52----------
mean but that's sort of on them and


---------124:53----------
you ask can i heal from it i think


---------124:55----------
absolutely and i think this


---------124:56----------
goes back to what we're talking about


---------124:58----------
which is that you've got to start with


---------124:59----------
yourself


---------125:00----------
right you've got to start with like


---------125:01----------
stopping the bullying towards yourself


---------125:03----------
this is the crazy thing that is you kind


---------125:05----------
of alluded to is that a lot of bullies


---------125:07----------
are bullies because they're hurting in


---------125:08----------
some way


---------125:09----------
like if you look at kids that are


---------125:10----------
behavioral and like hit other kids


---------125:13----------
it's oftentimes because they were abused


---------125:15----------
and you kind of mentioned you've alluded


---------125:17----------
to this but it's something that i call


---------125:18----------
the cycle of abuse


---------125:20----------
and it's like the cycle of abuse


---------125:21----------
continues like we see it in like medical


---------125:23----------
training where


---------125:24----------
you know you get yelled at in the


---------125:26----------
operating room by a surgeon because


---------125:28----------
i mean it's like my second day and some


---------125:29----------
guy's yelling at me because i don't know


---------125:30----------
how to do surgery i'm like


---------125:31----------
dude if i don't know how to do anything


---------125:33----------
in this room it's [ __ ] your fault


---------125:34----------
like it's not


---------125:35----------
yeah you're the person who's been doing


---------125:37----------
my second day bro


---------125:39----------
and and so so we do that right like we


---------125:42----------
learn a particular way of like


---------125:43----------
interacting and then we adopt those


---------125:45----------
patterns and we propagate them


---------125:47----------
so if you want to make the world a


---------125:48----------
better place and you want to heal the


---------125:49----------
hurt that you've caused and i don't


---------125:51----------
doubt that you've caused hurt and that's


---------125:52----------
not because you're a bad person because


---------125:53----------
we all cause hurt


---------125:55----------
like you know we're new at this thing


---------125:57----------
called life


---------125:59----------
yeah can you fix it i mean can you fix


---------126:01----------
those


---------126:02----------
particular things no i maybe not but i


---------126:04----------
don't think that's relevant i think


---------126:06----------
you've got to start


---------126:07----------
by like trying to make the world a


---------126:08----------
better place that i think you can


---------126:10----------
absolutely


---------126:11----------
start by understanding why you bully


---------126:13----------
yourself


---------126:14----------
that too track that back to your hurt


---------126:18----------
compassion towards that hurt will make


---------126:20----------
the bullying behavior go away


---------126:23----------
and once you become that person i have


---------126:25----------
no doubt in my mind that you will be


---------126:27----------
a force for overall met good in the


---------126:29----------
world if you aren't already


---------126:33----------
and that's what i think you should do in


---------126:35----------
that my friend is your karma


---------126:37----------
this is your journey and you've been


---------126:39----------
given these challenges


---------126:41----------
you've walked this path you've learned


---------126:43----------
how to stumble


---------126:44----------
you've learned how to fall and then you


---------126:46----------
will be in a different kind of place


---------126:49----------
because right now bullying yourself in


---------126:51----------
the trans community is transphobic and


---------126:54----------
no one is going to do it


---------126:55----------
but i would venture that a lot of people


---------126:57----------
are doing exactly what you do


---------126:59----------
but the problem is it's so [ __ ]


---------127:01----------
transphobic no one's allowed to talk


---------127:03----------
about it


---------127:03----------
so no one can ever help each other with


---------127:05----------
it no one else can ever be compassionate


---------127:07----------
towards it


---------127:08----------
well that is the problem is that because


---------127:10----------
on the one hand it's


---------127:12----------
either other people who are like very


---------127:14----------
transphobic


---------127:15----------
will take your side and then the people


---------127:18----------
who are hurt by what you're saying the


---------127:21----------
vilify you for it


---------127:23----------
so it's like the only compassion that is


---------127:26----------
is had for you is well there's no


---------127:28----------
compassion for you right


---------127:29----------
it's either taking your side into an


---------127:32----------
evil way well it's not an ethos of evil


---------127:34----------
but like you know in


---------127:35----------
some way in a mean way a malicious way


---------127:38----------
yeah so


---------127:39----------
there's like you know they're they're


---------127:41----------
seeing you as this villain


---------127:43----------
so natalie this is what i think you need


---------127:45----------
to do you need to


---------127:46----------
help yourself first and foremost and


---------127:49----------
then what you need to do


---------127:50----------
is shine out towards the rest of the


---------127:53----------
world


---------127:55----------
yeah right like once you become


---------127:58----------
like pure and clean and you accept


---------128:00----------
yourself who you


---------128:01----------
are just let broadcast that [ __ ] out


---------128:05----------
there


---------128:06----------
and some people are gonna get pissed at


---------128:08----------
you and some people are gonna glom on


---------128:09----------
and some people are gonna twist your


---------128:11----------
words


---------128:11----------
but it's been my overwhelming experience


---------128:14----------
that when you just


---------128:15----------
try to work on yourself and you become a


---------128:17----------
decent human being and you just let the


---------128:19----------
rest of the world see


---------128:20----------
it tends to work out pretty well yeah


---------128:24----------
so start by fixing the hurt within


---------128:26----------
yourself and then you can talk about


---------128:27----------
being transphobic or bullying yourself


---------128:29----------
or the hateful thoughts and if you use


---------128:31----------
those words right if you use if you say


---------128:33----------
like


---------128:34----------
i used to like look at myself in the


---------128:36----------
mirror and like i'm ashamed of who i see


---------128:38----------
there is no doubt in my mind that like


---------128:40----------
you know lots of trans people out there


---------128:42----------
are going to resonate with that and then


---------128:44----------
when you say


---------128:45----------
this is how i learned how to be


---------128:46----------
different a lot of people are going to


---------128:48----------
resonate with that and then they're


---------128:49----------
gonna stop bullying themselves and then


---------128:51----------
you'll be a


---------128:52----------
a force for good in the world and you


---------128:53----------
will have healed the hurt


---------128:56----------
sound good that sounds very good


---------129:01----------
this is very helpful glad because i


---------129:04----------
never know where this is going to go


---------129:06----------
no this is going very well okay i'm glad


---------129:10----------
i i i i need someone to tell me things


---------129:13----------
every day


---------129:14----------
okay yeah so who can that be


---------129:18----------
um there's a couple of people in my life


---------129:22----------
who


---------129:23----------
like incorrect i think i think okay


---------129:26----------
[Music]


---------129:27----------
who is that i have to tell myself is


---------129:30----------
that damn right


---------129:31----------
yeah yeah right


---------129:34----------
because here's the crazy thing what do


---------129:36----------
you tell yourself every day


---------129:39----------
uh what do i tell myself every day yeah


---------129:44----------
right


---------129:46----------
psy says it all yeah


---------129:50----------
yeah you're right you absolutely need


---------129:52----------
you need to hear these things every day


---------129:55----------
yeah you're damn right you and everyone


---------129:57----------
else is insecure


---------129:58----------
or struggles with something you need to


---------130:00----------
hear this every [ __ ] day


---------130:03----------
and there it's wonderful that you have


---------130:05----------
people in your life i encourage you to


---------130:07----------
recruit them


---------130:08----------
but once again it depends on which side


---------130:10----------
you're on are you


---------130:12----------
on their team natalie are you on the


---------130:14----------
toxic team


---------130:15----------
yeah to work on it


---------130:18----------
i have faith in you you come this far


---------130:22----------
and i think that like it's hard to come


---------130:23----------
this far without


---------130:25----------
you know having a lot of courage a lot


---------130:27----------
of resilience


---------130:29----------
brilliance frankly


---------130:33----------
yeah cool


---------130:37----------
so i i'm kind of done you okay wrapping


---------130:40----------
up


---------130:40----------
no i'm good that's that's sounds great


---------130:43----------
to me


---------130:44----------
yeah um so you know in terms of


---------130:46----------
meditation sometimes i'll teach a formal


---------130:48----------
practice but


---------130:49----------
in this case natalie i really encourage


---------130:51----------
you to like


---------130:52----------
watch what comes up so like go and look


---------130:54----------
at a picture of yourself and like


---------130:56----------
watch what comes up and even like like


---------130:58----------
just


---------130:59----------
watch those thoughts and those feelings


---------131:00----------
and then like try to be your older


---------131:03----------
sister and that's going to take practice


---------131:05----------
yeah you know if you feel ashamed of


---------131:07----------
yourself just look at yourself in the


---------131:09----------
mirror and see


---------131:10----------
what comes up see what you tell yourself


---------131:13----------
right and then try to it would be good


---------131:16----------
to do to be able to do that because i


---------131:18----------
feel like then i could also be an older


---------131:20----------
sister to other


---------131:21----------
trans people which is something that i


---------131:22----------
sort of have not quite gotten


---------131:24----------
to be able to do yeah because you


---------131:26----------
haven't been ready yet


---------131:27----------
yeah so that's your karma


---------131:31----------
right so like it'd be interesting


---------131:33----------
because i think from like a karmic


---------131:34----------
perspective


---------131:35----------
that if you wanted to be an older sister


---------131:36----------
to lots of trans people


---------131:38----------
i would recommend a career like a phd in


---------131:40----------
philosophy where you're doing research


---------131:42----------
in in an academic setting


---------131:46----------
as opposed to having a youtube channel


---------131:48----------
with a million subscribers where you


---------131:49----------
have a platform where you can


---------131:51----------
communicate


---------131:52----------
a message of positivity towards people


---------131:54----------
who need to hear it which one would you


---------131:55----------
pick


---------131:57----------
well i suppose at this point


---------132:02----------
the decision has been made i don't know


---------132:05----------
yeah i feel like i think this can be


---------132:07----------
done either way yep


---------132:08----------
and i think that's your karma right


---------132:11----------
because oh lo and behold


---------132:13----------
you happen to have a platform where you


---------132:15----------
get three million views


---------132:17----------
for videos that you make interesting


---------132:20----------
yeah it's a lot of um well it's


---------132:23----------
it frightens me actually the amount of


---------132:25----------
responsibility that it comes with that


---------132:27----------
good that is the best feeling that


---------132:29----------
you've had


---------132:32----------
all the time today you should be


---------132:33----------
terrified it's terrifying


---------132:36----------
because natalie you have a big burden on


---------132:38----------
your shoulders


---------132:39----------
yeah and the world needs you yeah


---------132:43----------
and so time to you know start treating


---------132:45----------
yourself well


---------132:46----------
get fully aligned with who you are as a


---------132:48----------
person because there are lots of trans


---------132:51----------
women and trans men and cis women and


---------132:53----------
cis men


---------132:54----------
who are insecure about what they see and


---------132:57----------
need something from you


---------132:59----------
and it turns out that you're an


---------133:01----------
incredibly thoughtful person who can


---------133:03----------
tell a very succinct


---------133:04----------
story with lots of context and


---------133:06----------
background and you have a training in


---------133:07----------
philosophy and argument


---------133:08----------
so if you have something to say turns


---------133:10----------
out that you're actually pretty skilled


---------133:12----------
at saying it and helping people


---------133:13----------
understand


---------133:14----------
so if you feel the crushing weight of


---------133:15----------
responsibility on your shoulders i'd say


---------133:17----------
good job


---------133:20----------
grow the [ __ ] up and get to work sounds


---------133:22----------
good


---------133:23----------
all right thank you so much for coming


---------133:26----------
