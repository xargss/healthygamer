---------00:16----------
description below


---------00:17----------
hey guys i'm dr oliver konoja i'm a


---------00:19----------
psychiatrist and co-founder of healthy


---------00:21----------
gamer


---------00:22----------
and we're on a quest to help the


---------00:23----------
internet with its mental health


---------00:25----------
so today i want to talk to you guys with


---------00:27----------
about something really important it's


---------00:29----------
one of the things that keeps people sort


---------00:30----------
of stuck


---------00:31----------
in failure and that's a principle called


---------00:34----------
moving goal posts


---------00:36----------
so one of the damnedest things that we


---------00:37----------
do to ourselves is that a lot of times


---------00:39----------
anytime we succeed we actually our mind


---------00:42----------
does this little flip that turns


---------00:44----------
success into a failure and i call that


---------00:47----------
principle moving goal posts


---------00:49----------
so a lot of times you know we'll set


---------00:50----------
goals for ourselves right we feel like a


---------00:52----------
failure because we're


---------00:54----------
um maybe we're out of shape or


---------00:57----------
you know we don't wake up on time or


---------00:59----------
things like that and then our mind does


---------01:00----------
something really really tricky when we


---------01:02----------
try to make a change


---------01:04----------
so what will actually end up happening


---------01:05----------
is we will make a change at some point


---------01:06----------
right one day you'll eat something


---------01:08----------
healthy


---------01:09----------
and then instead of viewing that as


---------01:11----------
success success our mind does something


---------01:13----------
really tricky if we eat a salad for


---------01:14----------
lunch


---------01:15----------
our mind does this really slippery thing


---------01:17----------
is that it tell


---------01:18----------
it tells us oh we should have done this


---------01:20----------
a long time ago


---------01:21----------
why didn't we start sooner right and oh


---------01:24----------
now we're going to start eating eating


---------01:26----------
healthy every day so our mind takes


---------01:28----------
one success and it turns it into a


---------01:30----------
failure just think about that right


---------01:32----------
and it does it in two ways the first


---------01:33----------
thing is that we beat ourselves up for


---------01:35----------
not doing it earlier


---------01:37----------
even though we're taking a step in the


---------01:38----------
right direction instead of being


---------01:40----------
inspired by it instead of being


---------01:42----------
motivated by it


---------01:43----------
instead of giving ourselves a pat on the


---------01:45----------
back what do we do


---------01:46----------
we beat ourselves up and so bizarrely we


---------01:49----------
turn


---------01:50----------
our success we turn this positive energy


---------01:53----------
in this good thing in our life that oh


---------01:55----------
we ate healthy today


---------01:56----------
and we turn it into a failure we


---------01:59----------
transform it into a failure about the


---------02:00----------
past oh i should have been


---------02:01----------
eating healthy my entire life and watch


---------02:04----------
what your mind does it's tricky right


---------02:06----------
and so it takes positive energy and


---------02:07----------
turns it into negative energy


---------02:09----------
the second thing that we do that sort of


---------02:11----------
destines us for failure


---------02:14----------
is that we take a success and then we


---------02:16----------
move the goal posts


---------02:18----------
we say oh i ate healthy today now i'm


---------02:20----------
going to eat healthy tomorrow


---------02:22----------
the goal that you woke up with today was


---------02:25----------
to eat


---------02:26----------
healthy today it's not to eat healthy


---------02:28----------
for the next week


---------02:29----------
or the next month or the next year it


---------02:32----------
was a small goal


---------02:33----------
and you can accomplish a small goal you


---------02:35----------
can take one step at a time


---------02:37----------
but our mind does the damnedest little


---------02:38----------
thing which is that it takes


---------02:40----------
a success and moves the goal posts on us


---------02:43----------
right


---------02:44----------
and then we destin ourselves for failure


---------02:47----------
so we say okay i ate healthy today now


---------02:50----------
i'm gonna eat healthy the entire week


---------02:52----------
and that's not something that you're


---------02:53----------
really capable of right because what can


---------02:55----------
you actually do you can eat healthy


---------02:57----------
maybe one meal but when you the second


---------02:59----------
that you have one success


---------03:01----------
you move the goal posts on yourself and


---------03:04----------
you set yourself


---------03:05----------
up for a success or for a failure that


---------03:08----------
because the success that you


---------03:10----------
want is not really going to be feasible


---------03:11----------
right you take taking one step forward


---------03:14----------
and then suddenly you expect so much


---------03:16----------
more from yourself you take the concept


---------03:18----------
of your success and then you move the


---------03:20----------
goal posts you change


---------03:22----------
the way you define success okay i ate


---------03:24----------
healthy today


---------03:25----------
now i have to eat healthy for the entire


---------03:27----------
week


---------03:29----------
and that too transforms your success


---------03:31----------
into a failure


---------03:33----------
so stop moving the goal posts on


---------03:34----------
yourself be really really careful


---------03:36----------
because this is what leads to a life


---------03:38----------
where you feel like a failure every day


---------03:40----------
the crazy thing about this is that


---------03:41----------
you're not a failure every day


---------03:43----------
you guys are actually succeeding all the


---------03:46----------
time


---------03:47----------
the problem is that you won't let


---------03:48----------
yourself sit with that success


---------03:50----------
you won't let yourself give yourself a


---------03:51----------
pat on the back all that ends up


---------03:53----------
happening is that you move the goal


---------03:54----------
posts on yourself and you expect so much


---------03:56----------
more than you're capable of


---------03:58----------
right instead of focusing and practicing


---------04:01----------
and getting better at eating healthy


---------04:03----------
today


---------04:04----------
the second you eat healthy today you


---------04:06----------
expect so much more of yourself tomorrow


---------04:08----------
and the next day in the next day and


---------04:10----------
then what happens is you inevitably fail


---------04:12----------
and when you


---------04:13----------
fail comes all the shame comes all the


---------04:16----------
disappointment comes all the oh i can't


---------04:18----------
you know i i'm lazy i'm undisciplined i


---------04:21----------
don't have any willpower


---------04:22----------
look at all those people out there that


---------04:23----------
are so much better than i am


---------04:25----------
i wish i was disciplined enough to eat a


---------04:27----------
salad every day


---------04:28----------
no my friend that's not what you should


---------04:31----------
wish what you should wish is exactly


---------04:32----------
what you've accomplished which is that


---------04:34----------
i wish every now and then i could eat a


---------04:36----------
salad


---------04:37----------
because if that's the goal post that you


---------04:38----------
set for yourself and you don't let


---------04:40----------
yourself move it


---------04:41----------
you can succeed and then you become a


---------04:43----------
different person


---------04:45----------
you become someone who succeeds


---------04:46----------
sometimes and fails sometimes


---------04:49----------
which is a wildly different thing from


---------04:51----------
someone who fails all the time


---------04:53----------
and why do you fail all the time because


---------04:55----------
you keep on moving goalposts on yourself


---------04:57----------
and so then we have to we have to beg


---------04:59----------
the question why do we do that


---------05:01----------
why do we move the goalposts it's


---------05:04----------
because of all of that negative


---------05:05----------
perception


---------05:06----------
that we have to balance right if i view


---------05:09----------
myself as a complete


---------05:10----------
failure if i view myself as someone who


---------05:13----------
fails all the time


---------05:15----------
the only success that will balance that


---------05:18----------
is a huge success


---------05:20----------
it's not good enough if i'm 300 pounds


---------05:23----------
overweight


---------05:24----------
it's not good enough to eat a salad one


---------05:26----------
day a week it's just not


---------05:28----------
good enough and that's what we tell


---------05:29----------
ourselves right because we have this


---------05:30----------
perception that we're


---------05:31----------
so overweight or that we're so much of a


---------05:34----------
failure that we have to balance it with


---------05:36----------
a big success it's the


---------05:38----------
only way to make up for how bad of a


---------05:40----------
person you are is you have to have an


---------05:42----------
astronomic success if you dropped out of


---------05:44----------
college you can't


---------05:46----------
finish community college you've got to


---------05:47----------
go to harvard right


---------05:49----------
you got to balance that success because


---------05:51----------
you feel like such a failure


---------05:53----------
there's got to be a huge success


---------05:54----------
otherwise it's not enough


---------05:57----------
and so when we eat healthy for a day we


---------05:59----------
say i gotta eat healthy for a month


---------06:01----------
because i have 300 pounds to lose eating


---------06:03----------
one


---------06:04----------
eating healthy one day a week is not


---------06:05----------
going to give me the success that i


---------06:08----------
need to be where i want to go


---------06:11----------
and so we move the goal posts because


---------06:13----------
we've got to make up for lost time right


---------06:15----------
we've got to make up for it because


---------06:17----------
we're such a failure


---------06:19----------
and why do we have to move the goal post


---------06:20----------
because we view ourselves as such a


---------06:22----------
failure


---------06:23----------
so what happens when we start to see


---------06:25----------
ourselves as instead of a complete


---------06:27----------
failure


---------06:28----------
someone who succeeds sometimes and fails


---------06:31----------
sometimes


---------06:32----------
if you start to see yourself that way


---------06:34----------
then suddenly you don't have to move the


---------06:36----------
goal posts as well


---------06:37----------
right you don't have to be an absolute


---------06:40----------
success


---------06:41----------
because you're successful half of the


---------06:43----------
time you only have to you only have to


---------06:44----------
move the goal posts a little bit


---------06:46----------
more you don't have to move them a huge


---------06:47----------
amount you just have to move a little


---------06:49----------
bit more


---------06:50----------
and then something magical happens


---------06:51----------
because the less you start moving the


---------06:53----------
goal posts


---------06:55----------
the more successful you become and the


---------06:57----------
more successful you become


---------06:59----------
the more your identity changes


---------07:02----------
to no longer being a failure and the


---------07:05----------
less of a failure you feel about


---------07:07----------
yourself


---------07:08----------
the less you move your goal posts the


---------07:10----------
less you move your goal posts


---------07:11----------
the more successful you become the more


---------07:14----------
you view yourself as a success


---------07:17----------
and the less you have to move your goal


---------07:18----------
posts


---------07:20----------
you guys feel stuck in a cycle of


---------07:23----------
failure


---------07:24----------
and that absolutely sucks and don't get


---------07:26----------
me wrong it is a cycle


---------07:28----------
right because with each failure more


---------07:30----------
shame you have to make it up more


---------07:32----------
each year that goes by that you fall


---------07:34----------
more and more behind


---------07:35----------
the more miraculous you have to be to


---------07:37----------
make up for lost time


---------07:39----------
if you're 24 years old you just have to


---------07:40----------
make up for a couple of years


---------07:42----------
if you're 28 years old you have to make


---------07:44----------
up for so much more time


---------07:45----------
if you're past your 30s now you have to


---------07:48----------
really do something miraculous to turn


---------07:50----------
things around


---------07:52----------
and so the bigger gap you create for


---------07:54----------
yourself the more of a failure you feel


---------07:56----------
like


---------07:57----------
and then the more of a failure you


---------07:58----------
become because the


---------08:00----------
the goal posts have moved so far that


---------08:02----------
there's no human way there's no


---------08:04----------
plausible way that you can actually


---------08:06----------
succeed you destine yourself for failure


---------08:10----------
so it is absolutely a vicious cycle and


---------08:13----------
the question is how to break it


---------08:15----------
and the good news is that the vicious


---------08:17----------
cycle works


---------08:18----------
both ways if you can start to


---------08:22----------
to take one step forward and be


---------08:24----------
satisfied with it


---------08:26----------
right if you can take one step forward


---------08:28----------
and not move the goal posts


---------08:30----------
and you can say you know what i did a


---------08:31----------
good job today


---------08:33----------
at the end of the day today is a day


---------08:35----------
that i actually ate healthy


---------08:37----------
today is a day where i may be 300 pounds


---------08:39----------
overweight


---------08:40----------
but i know at the end of today i'm not


---------08:42----------
301 pounds overweight


---------08:46----------
if you can give yourself one success and


---------08:48----------
then not move the goal posts


---------08:50----------
then you shift your perspective about


---------08:52----------
yourself the more you shift your


---------08:54----------
perspective the less you move the goal


---------08:55----------
posts


---------08:56----------
the easier it is to succeed and then the


---------08:58----------
more you shift your perspective


---------09:00----------
and then eventually you become the


---------09:03----------
person that you want to be


---------09:05----------
you become the person that you see and


---------09:07----------
you envy


---------09:08----------
you become the person that other people


---------09:11----------
envy


---------09:12----------
they look at you and they say man that


---------09:14----------
person is disciplined


---------09:15----------
that person isn't lazy and the crazy


---------09:18----------
thing


---------09:18----------
is that you are exactly the same thing


---------09:20----------
that you used to be


---------09:22----------
the only difference is what you do in


---------09:23----------
here the only difference is that you


---------09:25----------
perceive yourself


---------09:26----------
to not be a failure anymore because you


---------09:28----------
don't actually fail all the time


---------09:30----------
no one fails all the time it feels that


---------09:32----------
way


---------09:34----------
but you don't actually fail all the time


---------09:36----------
and then what you focus on is okay


---------09:38----------
i ate healthy today i ate healthy today


---------09:40----------
and i ate unhealthy for the next five


---------09:41----------
days


---------09:42----------
this week i'm gonna see if i can do one


---------09:44----------
day a week of eating healthy


---------09:46----------
and then you can do that right and then


---------09:48----------
the next day next week now here comes


---------09:50----------
the tricky thing what do you do the next


---------09:52----------
week


---------09:52----------
do you bump it up to two days a week no


---------09:54----------
no no that's moving the goal post


---------09:57----------
the next week you say let's see if we


---------09:59----------
can do it again


---------10:00----------
let's see if we can eat healthy one day


---------10:02----------
a week


---------10:04----------
and then the next week do you move it to


---------10:05----------
two days no no no


---------10:08----------
still one day a week and something


---------10:11----------
really magical starts to happen because


---------10:12----------
if you stop moving the goal posts


---------10:14----------
even though you set your target at one


---------10:17----------
day a week


---------10:18----------
you'll start to eat healthy more you'll


---------10:20----------
start to be inspired and then you'll say


---------10:22----------
oh wow i actually


---------10:23----------
ate healthy three days a week today


---------10:25----------
that's crazy


---------10:26----------
i better eat healthy three days next


---------10:28----------
week no no no


---------10:30----------
then you go to two be careful about


---------10:32----------
moving the goalposts


---------10:34----------
the second you start to expect


---------10:38----------
yourself to be perfect every day the


---------10:41----------
second you start to expect


---------10:44----------
more from yourself than you're capable


---------10:46----------
of is the second you doom yourself to


---------10:48----------
failure


---------10:50----------
and so acknowledge where you are and do


---------10:52----------
the best that you can today


---------10:54----------
and set low expectations for yourself


---------10:57----------
instead of correcting for all of the


---------11:01----------
crap that you've had to deal with in the


---------11:02----------
past instead of making up for lost time


---------11:05----------
because it's hard right


---------11:06----------
you can't lose 300 pounds in a week but


---------11:09----------
that's sure as hell what you feel like


---------11:10----------
you


---------11:11----------
have to do so don't give in to that


---------11:13----------
don't move the goal posts on yourself


---------11:16----------
expect more from your less from yourself


---------11:19----------
let yourself be worse than you are and


---------11:22----------
let yourself be successful at taking


---------11:24----------
tiny steps


---------11:26----------
there's no shame in eating healthy for


---------11:28----------
one day


---------11:29----------
create that shame in our mind by moving


---------11:31----------
our gulpos it isn't enough


---------11:34----------
i should have done it a long time ago


---------11:36----------
right so be careful


---------11:38----------
and something magical will happen if you


---------11:40----------
see yourself moving those goal posts and


---------11:42----------
you don't let yourself do it because you


---------11:44----------
have to catch yourself doing it first in


---------11:45----------
order to stop it


---------11:47----------
and the less you move your goal posts


---------11:49----------
the more your life is going to turn


---------11:51----------
in a positive direction and that's going


---------11:53----------
to be a vicious cycle too and that's


---------11:54----------
what happens with people who lose 300


---------11:56----------
pounds


---------11:57----------
it's a vicious cycle of positivity


---------11:59----------
instead of a vicious cycle of negativity


---------12:01----------
and that vicious cycle is born out of


---------12:05----------
not letting yourself move the goalposts


---------12:08----------
so i hope that this little tidbit and


---------12:10----------
this little insight


---------12:12----------
into why you're doomed for failure why


---------12:14----------
you're destined to failure helps you


---------12:15----------
because it really does help


---------12:17----------
as you start to see this stuff happen in


---------12:19----------
your mind you can see how you work as a


---------12:21----------
person


---------12:22----------
and you can start to make changes in


---------12:23----------
your life and if you guys like this kind


---------12:25----------
