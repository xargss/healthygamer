---------00:00----------
so a couple of things so um in light of


---------00:03----------
the election and all of the stress


---------00:04----------
we're actually launching uh uh a lot of


---------00:07----------
coaching spots on november 9th we've


---------00:09----------
been full for a couple of weeks


---------00:11----------
um and so we're gonna have a bunch more


---------00:13----------
spots opening up next week to help you


---------00:14----------
guys cope with the results of the


---------00:15----------
election


---------00:16----------
so i just wanted to share with you we


---------00:18----------
asked a client recently you know what


---------00:20----------
brought you into coaching like why'd you


---------00:22----------
sign up and this is what they said


---------00:23----------
i was struggling struggling with being


---------00:25----------
stuck in life not knowing what to do not


---------00:27----------
knowing how to proceed in life and


---------00:29----------
finding motivation


---------00:30----------
i felt like my gaming habits were


---------00:31----------
unhealthy i also didn't like my job


---------00:34----------
and i asked myself what else i could do


---------00:36----------
and didn't have an answer i didn't know


---------00:38----------
what i was looking for i felt like i was


---------00:40----------
in an mmo and doing all the side quests


---------00:43----------
i was done with the starter zone and i


---------00:45----------
didn't know what other places existed


---------00:47----------
so interestingly enough you know this is


---------00:50----------
the this is


---------00:51----------
why people sign up for coaching i think


---------00:52----------
that's prime example of what coaching is


---------00:54----------
about


---------00:55----------
it's not a medical treatment so it's not


---------00:57----------
there to fix your depression or anxiety


---------00:59----------
it's


---------01:00----------
it's there to help you get out of the


---------01:01----------
starter zone that's really what it's


---------01:02----------
about


---------01:03----------
and uh you know if you feel stuck or


---------01:05----------
unmotivated or don't really


---------01:07----------
know where to go like that's what we're


---------01:08----------
here for thanks for coming on


---------01:13----------
no thank you so much for having me on i


---------01:15----------
am uh i'm very excited about this


---------01:18----------
yeah so um oh oh so now i understand


---------01:20----------
your name so obese to beast


---------01:23----------
yeah if if you just read it as like


---------01:26----------
obesity beast it's just like what is


---------01:27----------
that i don't understand but yeah it's


---------01:29----------
like


---------01:29----------
obese to be beast and and so i'm


---------01:33----------
presuming that you used to be obese


---------01:35----------
yeah so when i was 20 years old i was


---------01:38----------
like close to 400 pounds so i


---------01:40----------
oh my god well probably like three i


---------01:42----------
always say 360


---------01:44----------
because when i first started losing


---------01:45----------
weight i was


---------01:47----------
uh didn't want to step on a scale so i


---------01:49----------
finally stepped on a scale after had


---------01:51----------
lost like a quite a bit and i saw like


---------01:53----------
and i was like oh i probably lost like


---------01:55----------
20 pounds um but then i've like talked


---------01:57----------
to other people like my mom and stuff


---------01:59----------
and she was just like i think you were


---------02:00----------
bigger than 360 but


---------02:02----------
i've said 360 since i started everything


---------02:04----------
so i'm not i'm not gonna like change my


---------02:05----------
high weight because you can't really do


---------02:07----------
that so


---------02:08----------
um yeah i always say right now 360. i


---------02:11----------
don't know i feel like it would be weird


---------02:12----------
if i've always said i was 360 pounds


---------02:14----------
then all of a sudden like someone comes


---------02:15----------
back after a year and i'm saying


---------02:17----------
yeah it was 400 pounds they'd be like


---------02:19----------
wait what how did you get heavier at one


---------02:20----------
point like you know


---------02:22----------
yeah it's it's interesting yeah i mean i


---------02:25----------
i think


---------02:26----------
you know if you if you understand things


---------02:28----------
to be different it's cool to change your


---------02:29----------
mind you know


---------02:31----------
and yeah i mean yeah you're right you're


---------02:34----------
not wrong


---------02:35----------
you're not wrong at all yeah it's it


---------02:37----------
sounds like maybe you're concerned about


---------02:39----------
what other people think and how you're


---------02:41----------
viewed


---------02:42----------
oh yeah yeah just checking the discord


---------02:45----------
server and and so what do you what


---------02:47----------
would you like to be called uh just call


---------02:50----------
me john


---------02:50----------
john okay and and john um so i don't


---------02:53----------
know how familiar you are so john can


---------02:55----------
you just tell us a little bit about uh i


---------02:57----------
understand you have a pretty prominent


---------02:58----------
youtube channel


---------03:00----------
yeah so uh i so i do have a youtube


---------03:04----------
channel i have like a youtube channel


---------03:06----------
instagram all that stuff so uh i started


---------03:08----------
the youtube channel like after i had


---------03:10----------
lost most of my weight


---------03:11----------
and it was just a place for me to kind


---------03:13----------
of so i had the instagram first


---------03:15----------
and i was getting a lot of questions


---------03:16----------
that i couldn't really answer on


---------03:18----------
instagram


---------03:19----------
this was like before instagram even had


---------03:20----------
stories or videos or anything right it


---------03:22----------
was only photos


---------03:23----------
and then so i was like i had a lot of


---------03:25----------
people that would ask me questions


---------03:26----------
and that i couldn't really answer just


---------03:28----------
through you know kind of


---------03:30----------
taking a picture and writing a caption


---------03:32----------
because i hate writing


---------03:33----------
uh and so i was like you know i want to


---------03:35----------
start a youtube channel and


---------03:37----------
i ended up kind of just starting that


---------03:38----------
just kind of to give people the


---------03:40----------
the like give answers that people had


---------03:42----------
questions too give


---------03:43----------
yeah give advance that doesn't make any


---------03:45----------
sense but um and then


---------03:47----------
so i started off like i wanted to do


---------03:48----------
full day of eating videos to kind of


---------03:50----------
show people what i was eating


---------03:51----------
and then uh like a transformation video


---------03:54----------
and then so


---------03:54----------
the way that it kind of took off and the


---------03:56----------
way that um i was able to become a


---------03:58----------
youtuber


---------03:59----------
was i actually had a video that went


---------04:01----------
really viral it was about my loose skin


---------04:03----------
so when you have a lot of weight to lose


---------04:05----------
and you lose a lot of weight you're left


---------04:07----------
with blue skin


---------04:08----------
and so i shared a video it's called my


---------04:09----------
biggest insecurity where i kind of you


---------04:11----------
know took my shirt off and showed people


---------04:12----------
what my loose skin looked


---------04:14----------
like and that video just ended up like


---------04:16----------
going viral


---------04:17----------
and i mean it completely changed like


---------04:19----------
that video and then


---------04:20----------
what i was able to do from that video


---------04:23----------
like completely changed like the


---------04:24----------
trajectory of my life um and so since


---------04:28----------
then i've just been


---------04:29----------
um pretty much like making making videos


---------04:31----------
and


---------04:32----------
streaming and you know just being a


---------04:34----------
content creator i guess


---------04:36----------
yeah can you help me understand a little


---------04:38----------
bit about um so


---------04:39----------
actually let me just take a step back so


---------04:40----------
john are you kind of familiar with what


---------04:42----------
we do or


---------04:43----------
do you want a quick intro oh no no i'm


---------04:46----------
very familiar i was i


---------04:47----------
i reached out to you guys because i was


---------04:49----------
just like wow i've watched a lot of the


---------04:50----------
videos on youtube because that's where i


---------04:52----------
um and like that's where i consume a lot


---------04:54----------
of content and so i was just like


---------04:56----------
selfishly i was like this would be great


---------04:58----------
to talk to dr k and then yeah i didn't


---------05:00----------
think anything would happen and it


---------05:01----------
worked out so


---------05:02----------
awesome and so so let's just talk about


---------05:04----------
that so you know what would you like to


---------05:06----------
talk about and


---------05:07----------
and how can i help or be of service to


---------05:09----------
you today


---------05:11----------
so the the first reason that i reached


---------05:14----------
out


---------05:15----------
was or the so this is what was kind of


---------05:17----------
going through my mind i felt like it was


---------05:19----------
a little selfish for me to this is just


---------05:21----------
how i am i felt like it was a little


---------05:23----------
and i was like hey i want i would love


---------05:27----------
to talk about the things that i struggle


---------05:28----------
with right and so


---------05:29----------
in my head i was like okay how can i


---------05:32----------
make this sound better


---------05:33----------
so i was like i think it would be


---------05:35----------
interesting um talk about


---------05:37----------
like the connection of like mental


---------05:39----------
health and physical health because i


---------05:40----------
personally have


---------05:42----------
um you know dealt with like improving my


---------05:44----------
physical health quite a bit


---------05:45----------
and i know like because i speak to a lot


---------05:48----------
of people that are trying to


---------05:49----------
you know lose weight improve their


---------05:50----------
physical health and they are also


---------05:52----------
struggling


---------05:52----------
with like mental health and i think a


---------05:55----------
lot of people


---------05:56----------
they think that if they improve their


---------05:58----------
their weight or their physical health


---------05:59----------
they think that it's going to be


---------06:01----------
like it's going to fix their their


---------06:03----------
mental health


---------06:04----------
um and i i thought that would be


---------06:05----------
interesting to kind of talk to you about


---------06:07----------
and then for myself personally like i


---------06:09----------
struggle with um a lot of the stuff that


---------06:11----------
i've


---------06:11----------
i've watched i mean the reason i knew


---------06:13----------
that you i even knew about you is


---------06:15----------
because i struggled with these things


---------06:16----------
and there therefore i was watching


---------06:18----------
videos right


---------06:18----------
so like anxiety and um like


---------06:22----------
depression i i guess you could call it


---------06:24----------
that at some time at some points


---------06:26----------
um and then i think another thing that i


---------06:28----------
struggle with which i know you've talked


---------06:30----------
about


---------06:31----------
before is like imposter syndrome um and


---------06:33----------
so like


---------06:34----------
those are probably like the main things


---------06:36----------
i would say that i that i struggle with


---------06:37----------
for sure


---------06:38----------
okay cool so let me just can i just uh


---------06:41----------
repeat back what i heard


---------06:42----------
john so um


---------06:46----------
you were hoping to come on to sort of


---------06:48----------
see if if maybe i could help you but


---------06:50----------
then i also get the sense that you felt


---------06:52----------
like maybe that was a little bit selfish


---------06:54----------
and that you you wanted to kind of cover


---------06:57----------
things that can be more applicable to


---------06:59----------
other people


---------07:00----------
and so talking a little bit more about


---------07:02----------
the mind-body connection and stuff like


---------07:04----------
that


---------07:05----------
um which i think is i think all that


---------07:07----------
stuff is fantastic so just a couple of


---------07:09----------
thoughts


---------07:09----------
uh just like a response john first of


---------07:11----------
all i think it's totally cool for you to


---------07:12----------
be selfish man


---------07:14----------
so i i think that that this channel is


---------07:16----------
what it is


---------07:17----------
because we talk about one person's


---------07:20----------
problems it's not an abstract discussion


---------07:22----------
and and i think that's actually what's


---------07:24----------
really cool is that the problems that


---------07:26----------
you think


---------07:26----------
may be selfish for you to talk about are


---------07:29----------
the very ones that i think will help


---------07:31----------
other people


---------07:32----------
um and at the same time if you want to


---------07:34----------
talk about mind-body stuff that's


---------07:35----------
actually it's interesting because people


---------07:37----------
sort of talk


---------07:37----------
you know they think i'm an expert on


---------07:39----------
like video games and social media and


---------07:41----------
technology and stuff which arguably i am


---------07:44----------
but really my background is in mind-body


---------07:46----------
medicine i mean that's what i've studied


---------07:47----------
for about


---------07:48----------
15 years um so i'd love to talk about


---------07:50----------
that just because you know i like to


---------07:52----------
hear myself talk about things that i


---------07:53----------
understand


---------07:57----------
but but i mean i you know i i would say


---------07:59----------
that what i


---------08:00----------
i really try to do john is like i'm here


---------08:01----------
to help you man and


---------08:03----------
and if it helps other people fantastic


---------08:05----------
but it's


---------08:06----------
it's um you know i think it's totally


---------08:08----------
cool for us to just talk about


---------08:10----------
you and then i'll throw in mind body


---------08:12----------
stuff because you seem to be interested


---------08:13----------
in that so we'll roll that in cool


---------08:16----------
so tell me excuse me so you said anxiety


---------08:18----------
depression and imposter syndrome


---------08:23----------
um can you tell me what you mean by


---------08:25----------
those terms


---------08:27----------
yeah i can do try to do my best to


---------08:29----------
explain it so


---------08:31----------
i the way that i explain when i like


---------08:33----------
have maybe an


---------08:34----------
anxiety attack or a panic attack or it


---------08:37----------
feels like


---------08:38----------
another person is taking over my body


---------08:40----------
and it's like i have no control over


---------08:43----------
the thoughts that they have um like and


---------08:45----------
it's frustrating because


---------08:47----------
i the people that are closest to me are


---------08:49----------
the people that i end up being like the


---------08:51----------
meanest two or the coldest two beautiful


---------08:53----------
um


---------08:54----------
and the like ever since i can remember


---------08:58----------
um i've i've never been a


---------09:01----------
like a loud person or like i never when


---------09:03----------
i got angry i don't


---------09:05----------
i don't lash out i just shut down like


---------09:07----------
and it's been like this since i was


---------09:09----------
uh i was a kid the one of the


---------09:12----------
i've i've shared this experience with


---------09:15----------
like my


---------09:16----------
my channel and stuff before but there


---------09:18----------
was one time where i was it was when i


---------09:19----------
was younger


---------09:20----------
i i got into an argument with my sister


---------09:23----------
and she said something kind of like


---------09:24----------
about my weight


---------09:25----------
and then instead of like me and my


---------09:27----------
sister's great but you know


---------09:28----------
siblings but um we got into an argument


---------09:32----------
and then she said that and


---------09:33----------
instead of me like yelling back at her i


---------09:35----------
just went to my room shut my door and i


---------09:37----------
stayed in my room


---------09:39----------
all day long like the rest of the day


---------09:40----------
like this was middle of the day


---------09:42----------
i stayed in my room until like midnight


---------09:44----------
that night and then there's


---------09:46----------
there's a taco shop that was by my house


---------09:47----------
when i was growing up that was open 24


---------09:49----------
7.


---------09:50----------
so i walked to that taco shop i bought a


---------09:52----------
uh


---------09:53----------
they're actually very good they're


---------09:54----------
called super nachos so they're basically


---------09:56----------
like nachos with carne asada beans


---------09:58----------
rice guacamole like anything i live in


---------10:01----------
san diego right so mexican food is like


---------10:03----------
a really big thing here


---------10:04----------
um and so i went and i got that and i


---------10:06----------
ate the whole thing


---------10:08----------
right like and it's like meant for four


---------10:09----------
people like at least


---------10:11----------
right and and i've been like that with


---------10:14----------
my mom whenever we would get into


---------10:15----------
arguments when i was younger


---------10:17----------
i would shut down like it's just how


---------10:18----------
i've always been and then


---------10:20----------
now as i'm older like i can't really do


---------10:23----------
that as much as i


---------10:24----------
used to because i have other


---------10:26----------
responsibilities so while


---------10:28----------
i'm shutting down mentally physically


---------10:30----------
i'm like i have to try and


---------10:33----------
do things still but it's i don't it's


---------10:36----------
just so strange because it's like


---------10:38----------
when i'm out of that mode of anxiety or


---------10:40----------
that


---------10:41----------
um like that feeling i look back and i'm


---------10:43----------
like what was i doing like why was i


---------10:45----------
doing why was i


---------10:46----------
acting that way i i just like like


---------10:48----------
that's why i say i feel like someone


---------10:49----------
else takes over my body


---------10:50----------
yeah because i get out of it and then


---------10:52----------
i'm just like


---------10:54----------
why was i what was i so worried about


---------10:56----------
like or why was i acting


---------10:57----------
like i'm like disappointed in the way


---------10:59----------
that i was acting


---------11:01----------
sure and then it it ends up getting


---------11:03----------
worse


---------11:04----------
because of how disappointed i am in


---------11:06----------
myself i'll end up not saying sorry i'll


---------11:09----------
end up not talking to the person


---------11:10----------
i'll end up like pushing myself further


---------11:13----------
back


---------11:14----------
because i feel bad about how i was


---------11:16----------
acting and


---------11:17----------
and then it's like oh it's been a day


---------11:18----------
it's been two days now it's too it's


---------11:20----------
it's been too late for me to even act


---------11:21----------
out um


---------11:23----------
and then like with like the depression


---------11:25----------
kind of is linked in with that like it's


---------11:27----------
a very


---------11:28----------
um like when i start feeling that way


---------11:30----------
especially if it's it over an elongated


---------11:32----------
period of time


---------11:33----------
it's like it just adds and adds and adds


---------11:36----------
um yeah and then like with the with the


---------11:38----------
imposter stuff i feel like that's


---------11:40----------
it's probably i'm sure it's all


---------11:42----------
connected but it's a little bit less


---------11:43----------
related because for me


---------11:45----------
like i have hundreds of thousands of


---------11:47----------
people that follow me on all my


---------11:49----------
platforms right


---------11:50----------
and i am just a dude that lost weight


---------11:52----------
and so it's


---------11:53----------
a lot of people will message me and


---------11:54----------
think that i can like solve all their


---------11:56----------
problems


---------11:57----------
and they they think that i am like i


---------11:59----------
just struggle with being like i've said


---------12:01----------
it so many times when it comes to like


---------12:02----------
like the weight that i've lost and like


---------12:04----------
what i've been able to do


---------12:05----------
like i'm not special in any way like i


---------12:07----------
didn't i don't have something special


---------12:09----------
about me that made it so


---------12:10----------
hey i can like um i was able to do this


---------12:13----------
and no one else can and you should


---------12:15----------
definitely reach out to me because i


---------12:16----------
have all the answers it's like dude i


---------12:17----------
was just a normal guy


---------12:18----------
i was just a normal guy that was working


---------12:20----------
minimum wage jobs


---------12:22----------
that was like like i said that's why i


---------12:23----------
say like i'm so thankful for what i do


---------12:25----------
now


---------12:25----------
because my future then was not very


---------12:28----------
uh bright like when i look back at it


---------12:32----------
and so um that kind of plays into it and


---------12:35----------
i think like


---------12:37----------
another thing that i kind of struggle


---------12:38----------
with and i think it's related to that is


---------12:40----------
i can talk forever so


---------12:41----------
um but keep going bro i uh i struggle


---------12:44----------
with


---------12:45----------
not feeling like i'm very smart so


---------12:46----------
growing up um


---------12:48----------
i was in special ed my whole life um and


---------12:51----------
so like i remember i went to college and


---------12:54----------
i


---------12:55----------
i went for like one year and i was so


---------12:58----------
bad


---------12:59----------
like i i was a music major and one of


---------13:01----------
the classes i took they were like you


---------13:02----------
have to know how to read music to be in


---------13:03----------
this class i don't know how to read


---------13:05----------
music


---------13:05----------
and so i was just like uh okay well i


---------13:07----------
guess i'll drop this one and


---------13:09----------
um and so like that's another thing that


---------13:11----------
has like followed me my whole life is


---------13:13----------
feeling like


---------13:14----------
i'm like i'm dumb and so i think that


---------13:17----------
goes into why


---------13:18----------
like i have the imposter syndrome


---------13:20----------
because i'm like why are people


---------13:21----------
following me i'm not smart enough to


---------13:22----------
help anyone kind of thing


---------13:23----------
like that's again those are the thoughts


---------13:26----------
i have when i'm that person that's like


---------13:27----------
anxious and stuff but when i step back


---------13:29----------
i'm like


---------13:30----------
well regardless of what what um


---------13:33----------
what how many how many like how many


---------13:36----------
diplomas i might have or whatever


---------13:37----------
like i've still been able to help this


---------13:39----------
many people regardless of that


---------13:40----------
like i know that but again like when i'm


---------13:42----------
in that mode it doesn't matter


---------13:44----------
okay so okay so you know sometimes i'm


---------13:47----------
gonna say


---------13:48----------
beautiful to some things but those


---------13:50----------
things aren't beautiful i i think it's


---------13:51----------
just i i'm i'm


---------13:52----------
first of all john i'm really excited for


---------13:54----------
this conversation


---------13:56----------
um i i think you're uh


---------13:59----------
you know your ability to


---------14:03----------
map out what your internal experiences i


---------14:05----------
think is like


---------14:06----------
amazing and i think this is


---------14:07----------
unfortunately one of the consequences


---------14:10----------
of you know being in your head a lot and


---------14:12----------
suffering


---------14:13----------
a lot right and you can see that you're


---------14:16----------
not actually in control


---------14:18----------
um and you just gave me so much that can


---------14:21----------
i just


---------14:22----------
try to collect my thoughts and think


---------14:23----------
about a plan of attack


---------14:25----------
for for how to approach this stuff yeah


---------14:34----------
okay so i've got a couple of thoughts


---------14:36----------
okay so the first thing i'm gonna just


---------14:37----------
toss out maybe a map


---------14:39----------
and then we can decide you know which


---------14:41----------
direction you wanna go


---------14:43----------
okay so there are some things in your


---------14:46----------
mind and we can explore the origins of


---------14:48----------
those things


---------14:49----------
and then the second thing that we can do


---------14:50----------
is we can explore


---------14:52----------
how those things manifest and function


---------14:54----------
in the present


---------14:56----------
and what i mean by that is that like you


---------14:58----------
become another person right so we can


---------15:00----------
think about


---------15:00----------
how does that work in the mind where you


---------15:03----------
become another person


---------15:05----------
and so then that sort of begs this like


---------15:06----------
interesting philosophical question of


---------15:08----------
like who are you


---------15:09----------
if you become another person and then


---------15:10----------
like what is the relationship


---------15:12----------
between not just your body and your mind


---------15:15----------
but you


---------15:16----------
and your body and your mind so we can


---------15:19----------
think about where that other person


---------15:21----------
comes from


---------15:22----------
we can think about how that other person


---------15:24----------
takes control


---------15:25----------
and then we can also think about what


---------15:27----------
you do


---------15:29----------
in response to that other person taking


---------15:31----------
control


---------15:32----------
which isn't of itself a third person


---------15:36----------
right there's the one who panics and


---------15:39----------
loses confidence


---------15:40----------
and then there's the you who beats


---------15:42----------
yourself up for not doing good enough


---------15:44----------
and the crazy thing is that's still not


---------15:46----------
you that's just another person who crops


---------15:48----------
up


---------15:49----------
and then we can also think through a lot


---------15:51----------
of the consequences of all of that stuff


---------15:54----------
so principles like you know why is it


---------15:56----------
that we're meanest to the people


---------15:58----------
closest to us and that actually like the


---------16:00----------
people that we love and care about the


---------16:02----------
most


---------16:02----------
are the ones that we you know sort of


---------16:05----------
show our ugliest side to


---------16:08----------
and then the last thing that we can kind


---------16:09----------
of touch on is something about the


---------16:11----------
imposter syndrome which is just that


---------16:12----------
you know all these people approach you


---------16:14----------
and you say i'm just a dude who lost


---------16:15----------
weight i'm not special in any way


---------16:17----------
and we can talk a little bit about that


---------16:21----------
um and john i think oddly enough


---------16:24----------
that's the reason that they approach you


---------16:25----------
in in summary


---------16:27----------
i think because you do you're so


---------16:30----------
authentic that people reach out to you


---------16:33----------
for help


---------16:34----------
because you're an ordinary guy and so if


---------16:37----------
an


---------16:37----------
ordinary guy can do it they can do it


---------16:39----------
too but if you were superhuman


---------16:42----------
then it doesn't apply right like it just


---------16:45----------
doesn't apply


---------16:46----------
and so oddly enough i think that's


---------16:48----------
actually where your value


---------16:50----------
really is you kind of say i'm nothing


---------16:51----------
special and i think absolutely you're


---------16:53----------
nothing special


---------16:54----------
and that's what makes you priceless


---------16:57----------
right because you've done it and you


---------17:00----------
were working minimum wage jobs and you


---------17:02----------
did do one year of college and you


---------17:03----------
weren't something like amazing and


---------17:05----------
special and


---------17:06----------
that in and of itself is what's so


---------17:07----------
[ __ ] amazing about you


---------17:09----------
and that's why people reach out to you


---------17:11----------
so in a weird way i'd say that there's


---------17:13----------
there's some kind of embracing which i


---------17:15----------
think you know how to do


---------17:17----------
um there's some embracing of who you are


---------17:20----------
which is absolutely amazing and at the


---------17:22----------
same time nothing special that those


---------17:25----------
contrary ideas in your mind can be held


---------17:28----------
together


---------17:30----------
um and then the last thing that i just


---------17:32----------
really appreciated is that you you know


---------17:34----------
you do actually share some stories about


---------17:35----------
like your sister and stuff like that


---------17:37----------
and i think that kind of stuff really


---------17:39----------
helps because it


---------17:40----------
it it kind of gives us like not just


---------17:43----------
abstract thinking but like this is


---------17:44----------
actually the sequence of events


---------17:46----------
and then we can really understand what's


---------17:48----------
going on inside you


---------17:50----------
um so any thoughts or responses to that


---------17:55----------
any direction no i mean i i think that


---------17:58----------
everything that you just said i i


---------18:00----------
i'm excited to talk about and i i think


---------18:02----------
like just


---------18:03----------
as someone that's watched a lot of of


---------18:05----------
your content and stuff like i i do


---------18:07----------
i do fully acknowledge and i'm sure that


---------18:10----------
some of this


---------18:10----------
a lot of the stuff that happened in my


---------18:12----------
past which i've had a


---------18:14----------
interesting you know childhood um


---------18:17----------
definitely affects me


---------18:18----------
now like sure i i know that for a fact i


---------18:21----------
just don't know


---------18:22----------
how and to what extent right right like


---------18:23----------
i'm just not totally


---------18:25----------
sure of how right so let's dig in man so


---------18:28----------
tell me about your as you put an


---------18:30----------
interesting past yeah so


---------18:33----------
so growing up um my mom was


---------18:37----------
my mom and dad were both drug addicts


---------18:38----------
and so we actually were taken away


---------18:40----------
when i say we i have i have a lot of


---------18:42----------
siblings like seven or eight


---------18:44----------
but most of them are half and some of


---------18:46----------
them i never met because like


---------18:47----------
one of them his name's nick um he was


---------18:50----------
given up


---------18:51----------
right as he was born and i've never met


---------18:52----------
him right and so like a lot of my


---------18:54----------
siblings are like half-siblings but


---------18:56----------
um growing up like who i was with most


---------18:58----------
in my full siblings are my brother jean


---------19:01----------
and my sister evelyn okay so it was us


---------19:04----------
three that grew up with


---------19:05----------
my mom and kind of my dad a little bit


---------19:08----------
um but when i was really young and i


---------19:09----------
said when i say young i was like three


---------19:11----------
or four i think we were we were taken


---------19:12----------
away from them


---------19:13----------
um from cps child protective services


---------19:16----------
and uh because they were drug addicts


---------19:18----------
and


---------19:18----------
we were put into this place is called


---------19:20----------
polinsky here in san diego it's just


---------19:21----------
like a foster care place and then


---------19:23----------
luckily seriously luckily our uncle took


---------19:26----------
us in which is very strange because


---------19:28----------
we're not very close with him


---------19:29----------
because if if he didn't take us in we


---------19:30----------
would have either one been like


---------19:32----------
shipped off to other foster homes and


---------19:34----------
maybe not kept together


---------19:35----------
or we would have been um shipped off to


---------19:38----------
my grand


---------19:39----------
grandmother who lives in um pennsylvania


---------19:41----------
so on the east coast


---------19:42----------
and we would have from what i understand


---------19:44----------
what my mom has told us like if that


---------19:46----------
happened


---------19:47----------
we would have been there until my sister


---------19:49----------
turned 18. like it would have been


---------19:51----------
there was no chance we could have went


---------19:52----------
back with my mom so


---------19:54----------
um it's kind of a happy ending though


---------19:56----------
because after about a year we actually


---------19:58----------
were put back with my mom which does not


---------20:00----------
happen very often


---------20:01----------
with cps because my mom actually she


---------20:03----------
went to a drug rehabilitation center


---------20:05----------
it was a church um and they have like a


---------20:07----------
drug rehabilitation like


---------20:08----------
thing that they do it's called it was


---------20:10----------
called calvary ranch and she was able to


---------20:12----------
get clean and she's been clean ever


---------20:13----------
since then


---------20:14----------
so like you know and so it was it is


---------20:16----------
really cool


---------20:17----------
but um yeah and uh and so do you do you


---------20:20----------
know what your mom


---------20:22----------
if you don't mind me asking you don't


---------20:23----------
have to answer this out of you know


---------20:25----------
um uh respect for her privacy but do you


---------20:27----------
happen to know what substances she was


---------20:29----------
using


---------20:31----------
yeah it was like meth for the most part


---------20:33----------
okay do you


---------20:34----------
do you know if she was using while she


---------20:35----------
was pregnant with you


---------20:37----------
um i honestly i i wouldn't be


---------20:41----------
surprised that i i don't think i've ever


---------20:42----------
even asked i think it's like one of


---------20:44----------
those things i was like i don't really


---------20:45----------
want to know if i want to know this


---------20:46----------
okay sure um and if i if i ask something


---------20:49----------
that's out of line just let me know okay


---------20:51----------
john


---------20:52----------
i will but i highly doubt there will be


---------20:54----------
anything okay i'm very open about all


---------20:55----------
this stuff


---------20:56----------
um but yes i'll let you know um so we


---------20:58----------
ended up getting put back with her


---------21:00----------
um but growing up like then we were


---------21:02----------
pretty much just with


---------21:03----------
her um and my dad was like kind of


---------21:05----------
around but then after about a few years


---------21:07----------
we ended up moving away from him


---------21:09----------
it's an interesting family dynamic that


---------21:11----------
we can go into but like we don't not


---------21:13----------
like my dad we're actually i'm actually


---------21:14----------
very close


---------21:15----------
oh i'm close with him and his now


---------21:17----------
basically wife


---------21:18----------
and their whole family like we're a big


---------21:20----------
mixed family now


---------21:22----------
but at the time uh growing up uh we were


---------21:25----------
just very


---------21:25----------
poor i guess you could call it like we


---------21:27----------
just didn't have much money like my mom


---------21:29----------
was working


---------21:30----------
um you know it's like many many many


---------21:32----------
hours


---------21:33----------
um and so therefore we just didn't have


---------21:36----------
like we were


---------21:36----------
we're on government housing um so it's


---------21:39----------
called section 8 here in california


---------21:41----------
and so we were on that and just like


---------21:43----------
money was not something we had


---------21:45----------
very much of and so uh kind of growing


---------21:48----------
up


---------21:49----------
yeah yeah it was yeah it was


---------21:53----------
we had some some tough times we were


---------21:55----------
really lucky that some of the


---------21:56----------
local churches around us would kind of


---------21:59----------
like take care of us around like certain


---------22:00----------
holidays


---------22:01----------
like we had um we had this place called


---------22:03----------
sunshine haven that every like christmas


---------22:06----------
they would come like um a day before


---------22:08----------
christmas christmas eve for like two


---------22:10----------
days and they would just drop off


---------22:11----------
presents


---------22:12----------
because like they would have people like


---------22:13----------
donate them and then they'd go to like


---------22:14----------
families in need


---------22:15----------
i remember this is random but like one


---------22:17----------
year they


---------22:19----------
they gave my mom a present it was


---------22:22----------
underwear but they were like


---------22:23----------
comically large and i just remember we


---------22:26----------
all it was so funny like there were no


---------22:27----------
joke like


---------22:28----------
this big you know but um


---------22:31----------
so yeah like growing up and then and


---------22:33----------
then you know like


---------22:35----------
i that's when i i started gaining weight


---------22:38----------
um because like that was a huge part of


---------22:40----------
like of my like childhood was


---------22:42----------
when i was about seven years old and i


---------22:45----------
remember like


---------22:46----------
being frustrated because my family would


---------22:48----------
eat the same foods as me


---------22:49----------
but none of them were getting as big as


---------22:51----------
i was like because i was


---------22:53----------
i was like from seven years old up until


---------22:55----------
i was 20 i just consistently gained and


---------22:57----------
it was like


---------22:58----------
it started like every year it was


---------22:59----------
becoming more and more of an issue for


---------23:01----------
me


---------23:02----------
um and and then in second grade was when


---------23:05----------
i actually ended up being


---------23:07----------
put in special ed or rsp um resource


---------23:10----------
specialist


---------23:11----------
program um and then from from there on


---------23:13----------
out like i just


---------23:14----------
i just remember like my mom tells the


---------23:18----------
story but like


---------23:18----------
there would be times where i would come


---------23:20----------
home from school and i would just be


---------23:21----------
crying


---------23:22----------
like because i'd be trying to do the


---------23:23----------
homework and like we're doing


---------23:25----------
multiplication


---------23:26----------
and like everyone just understands it


---------23:27----------
and i'm like what is this


---------23:30----------
like i had no idea what was going on and


---------23:33----------
i just i don't know why i remember that


---------23:35----------
like from that moment i've always


---------23:37----------
felt like i'm not good enough um


---------23:40----------
and like i there's something wrong with


---------23:42----------
me kind of thing


---------23:43----------
um but i will say like all in all with


---------23:46----------
all of that stuff that has happened


---------23:48----------
like that's why i'm so thankful of where


---------23:51----------
i am now


---------23:53----------
because like if we if we were to talk


---------23:56----------
about


---------23:56----------
where you should be like i should not be


---------23:59----------
where i am now


---------24:00----------
at least in my mind um with like the


---------24:02----------
background that i have


---------24:04----------
and so that's why i'm so like thankful


---------24:06----------
and i i try my best to


---------24:08----------
um foster i guess my community or foster


---------24:11----------
what i have as best as i can


---------24:13----------
um because i know that i just i feel


---------24:16----------
like i know where i would be if i didn't


---------24:18----------
have it


---------24:21----------
okay


---------24:27----------
john your story is incredibly rich man


---------24:31----------
seriously there's so many well it's more


---------24:33----------
poor than it is rich but


---------24:35----------
i'm sorry uh yes


---------24:38----------
fair point um no i bet i mean a good one


---------24:41----------
to be honest it's not stupid it's


---------24:43----------
actually brilliant


---------24:45----------
um but you know there's just there's so


---------24:47----------
much here


---------24:50----------
and this is going to be tough my dude i


---------24:52----------
i think i think um


---------24:53----------
i already sort of see a road forward for


---------24:56----------
you but i think it's going to be a


---------24:57----------
little bit challenging and i just want


---------24:59----------
to sketch this out a little bit


---------25:01----------
okay


---------25:06----------
so when you say i shouldn't be where i


---------25:08----------
am today


---------25:11----------
that implies so much gratitude


---------25:15----------
right and you kind of say i'm lucky like


---------25:18----------
you talk about your uncle


---------25:19----------
and and stuff like that um


---------25:22----------
and so the the tricky thing there is


---------25:24----------
that like being grateful for


---------25:25----------
for where you are and and feeling lucky


---------25:27----------
is like that's a good thing right we


---------25:29----------
we like we respect people for that we


---------25:32----------
we prioritize people for that


---------25:36----------
um but there's there's actually like a


---------25:40----------
a tricky underbelly which maybe exists


---------25:42----------
here and i i suspect maybe it does and i


---------25:44----------
think this manifests in


---------25:45----------
in some other ways which is that


---------25:49----------
you know if you if you don't deserve to


---------25:51----------
be i mean if you shouldn't be where you


---------25:53----------
are today then in a sense you don't


---------25:55----------
deserve it


---------25:58----------
right and if we if we really tunnel down


---------26:00----------
this is where things get really subtle


---------26:01----------
because


---------26:02----------
if you don't deserve it that sort of


---------26:05----------
implies


---------26:06----------
a certain value about you as a human


---------26:08----------
being


---------26:11----------
whereas there's a part of me that tells


---------26:12----------
you actually like that wants to say to


---------26:14----------
you john you absolutely deserve


---------26:15----------
everything that you have man in fact you


---------26:18----------
deserve so much more than you have


---------26:21----------
that sure you can be lucky and grateful


---------26:23----------
but actually at the end of the day


---------26:25----------
if you look at what you deserve and what


---------26:27----------
you're worth it's way more


---------26:29----------
than what you have does that make sense


---------26:33----------
yeah right and it's hard because


---------26:36----------
somewhere along the way like you started


---------26:38----------
to


---------26:39----------
consider yourself lucky that you got to


---------26:41----------
live with your mom and like it's


---------26:43----------
wonderful that you have that gratitude


---------26:45----------
but at the end of the day


---------26:48----------
that's not lucky bro your life


---------26:52----------
is filled with bad beats


---------26:57----------
right and really what you deserve is


---------27:00----------
like way more


---------27:01----------
like you do you don't deserve like it's


---------27:04----------
wonderful that you're grateful but like


---------27:06----------
you've got to be really careful because


---------27:07----------
there's something really subtle here


---------27:09----------
which is that underneath the positivity


---------27:11----------
is this underlying belief that if you're


---------27:13----------
lucky


---------27:14----------
then you didn't deserve it


---------27:19----------
and if we kind of go back to the heart


---------27:21----------
of the imposter syndrome


---------27:23----------
i think that has to do with like this


---------27:25----------
fundamental idea that like you


---------27:27----------
don't deserve this


---------27:30----------
right and if we really it gets tricky so


---------27:32----------
we'll dig into that a little bit more


---------27:33----------
does that make sense


---------27:35----------
no yeah i mean i think that


---------27:39----------
yeah 100 i think i think that there's


---------27:42----------
it's kind of like i mean in layman's


---------27:43----------
terms is what my mind is thinking is


---------27:45----------
like too much of a good thing


---------27:47----------
like there's such thing as that right


---------27:48----------
being grateful sometimes can be like


---------27:50----------
after you turn it into being like i


---------27:51----------
don't deserve which i


---------27:53----------
i don't think that that in the end is


---------27:55----------
going to


---------27:56----------
be a net positive if that's because


---------27:58----------
that's that is kind of where my mind


---------28:00----------
ends up going when i go down that road


---------28:02----------
yeah right so and that's that's and i


---------28:05----------
think it manifests in kind of weird ways


---------28:07----------
like i think that


---------28:08----------
um what i'm not hearing a whole lot of


---------28:10----------
you so it's funny because people who


---------28:11----------
come on stream


---------28:12----------
either i hear too much anger from them


---------28:14----------
or i hear not enough


---------28:17----------
and and i i think there's something


---------28:19----------
about retreating and


---------28:20----------
and i'm getting the vibe of anger that


---------28:24----------
is manifesting


---------28:25----------
in different ways like it's like anger


---------28:28----------
you know


---------28:28----------
there's a there's a lot of injustice in


---------28:30----------
your story actually


---------28:33----------
and i think sometimes we kind of look at


---------28:35----------
ourselves and we say like what's the


---------28:36----------
point


---------28:37----------
of like bitching about unjustice and how


---------28:40----------
unlucky we are


---------28:43----------
and and that sort of makes sense because


---------28:44----------
i think a lot of times that too can be


---------28:46----------
too much of a bad thing and then it kind


---------28:48----------
of


---------28:49----------
you know we're just complaining all the


---------28:51----------
time and so i think you've learned how


---------28:53----------
to be incredibly positive


---------28:55----------
how to pick yourself up by your


---------28:56----------
bootstraps how to you know i i think


---------28:58----------
it's clear that you've gone from


---------29:00----------
obese to beast and the interesting thing


---------29:02----------
is that that journey


---------29:04----------
actually i i get the sense that you've


---------29:06----------
pushed a part of yourself off to the


---------29:08----------
side


---------29:10----------
and then you have this like little boy


---------29:12----------
in the basement like this seven-year-old


---------29:14----------
fat kid who doesn't know how to do


---------29:15----------
multiplication


---------29:18----------
and then every once in a while like


---------29:20----------
something happens and the fat kid comes


---------29:22----------
out of the basement and that's how you


---------29:23----------
feel right like even i i would venture


---------29:27----------
when you when that other person takes


---------29:29----------
you over you're not even an adult


---------29:32----------
i mean yeah i feel like i'm being a


---------29:34----------
child is like because you are being a


---------29:36----------
child


---------29:36----------
yeah yeah because you are and that's not


---------29:38----------
an un


---------29:40----------
and this is the really tricky thing john


---------29:41----------
boy dude this is going to be tough bro


---------29:43----------
because because what i what i would love


---------29:46----------
to help you do


---------29:47----------
is to not discount the fact that you are


---------29:50----------
behaving like child because you are


---------29:52----------
because that's


---------29:52----------
what happens and we'll talk about the


---------29:54----------
mechanism of what's happening in your


---------29:55----------
mind


---------29:56----------
but for you to acknowledge that you are


---------29:58----------
behaving like a child


---------29:59----------
and that you deserve to do so


---------30:03----------
right because when you when you beat up


---------30:05----------
that seven-year-old kid what does he do


---------30:06----------
he goes he


---------30:07----------
eats a plate of super nachos


---------30:11----------
and then you know goes into the basement


---------30:13----------
and you push him in


---------30:14----------
and then like he comes out again and


---------30:16----------
he's gained five pounds


---------30:18----------
and then over time despite all of your


---------30:20----------
successes you've taken all of your


---------30:21----------
negativity


---------30:22----------
and you've kind of like condensed it


---------30:24----------
into this one thing


---------30:25----------
that pops out of the surface every now


---------30:29----------
and then


---------30:30----------
and so it's kind of like i i don't doubt


---------30:33----------
that you've grown and it's clear that


---------30:34----------
you know


---------30:35----------
i mean you've grown immensely john and i


---------30:36----------
think this is the real challenge


---------30:39----------
is that you know i think you've picked a


---------30:41----------
lot of the low-hanging fruit so your


---------30:43----------
growth


---------30:43----------
now the the more pure you become


---------30:47----------
the more subtle the growth that you have


---------30:49----------
to do and actually the harder it becomes


---------30:52----------
right if i have like a really dirty


---------30:53----------
table i can just take


---------30:56----------
one swipe of a cloth and do a lot of


---------30:57----------
cleaning but if i only have one speck of


---------31:00----------
dust left i really have to look really


---------31:02----------
really hard


---------31:03----------
and and i'm laying the foundation for a


---------31:05----------
couple of principles that


---------31:06----------
i'll explain later about mind body stuff


---------31:10----------
um but any thoughts about that


---------31:14----------
no i mean i i think it all it all makes


---------31:16----------
sense


---------31:17----------
um it's i it's interesting um like the


---------31:20----------
thing that kind of stuck out to me


---------31:21----------
uh like the one thing that when you said


---------31:23----------
it i was like oh interesting i would


---------31:24----------
have never


---------31:25----------
thought that was like you were acting


---------31:27----------
like and you deserve to do


---------31:29----------
that in my mind it just it's this


---------31:31----------
feeling of


---------31:32----------
no like don't act like that you need to


---------31:36----------
like i beat myself up right like when


---------31:38----------
i'm acting that way


---------31:39----------
and then that's what it's it turns into


---------31:41----------
this cycle that i was explaining then i


---------31:43----------
don't reach out to the person and then


---------31:44----------
it's like


---------31:44----------
you know so i thought that that was


---------31:46----------
interesting yeah so let's talk about


---------31:48----------
that for a second right because i said


---------31:49----------
that's actually a third person


---------31:51----------
there's john there's the seven-year-old


---------31:53----------
fat kid


---------31:54----------
and then there's the kid who beats up


---------31:56----------
the seven-year-old fat kid


---------31:57----------
your first step forward and this is the


---------31:59----------
problem that a lot of people run into is


---------32:01----------
they think


---------32:01----------
my problem is the seven years does it


---------32:03----------
hurt your feelings when i say


---------32:04----------
seven-year-old fat kid


---------32:06----------
not at all is that insensitive okay no


---------32:09----------
that's fine


---------32:10----------
so so i and i think the problem is that


---------32:12----------
everyone looks and they say oh the


---------32:13----------
problem is that the seven-year-old fat


---------32:15----------
kid keeps on coming out of the basement


---------32:16----------
and they say that's the part of me that


---------32:18----------
i want to change


---------32:19----------
and the reason that they stay stuck is


---------32:22----------
because that's not actually what you


---------32:23----------
need to change


---------32:24----------
you need to change before that you need


---------32:26----------
to change


---------32:28----------
the bully that lives within you


---------32:33----------
and once you change the bully then


---------32:35----------
you'll be able to deal with the fat kid


---------32:36----------
but the real problem is like


---------32:38----------
you know the the fat kid's a little bit


---------32:40----------
of a distraction


---------32:41----------
and so that now the next question is is


---------32:43----------
you know where did you learn


---------32:44----------
how to judge yourself that way like like


---------32:48----------
it's this judgment i think that we


---------32:49----------
actually need to start


---------32:51----------
and so can you tell me you know did


---------32:54----------
other people judge you growing up like


---------32:56----------
like let's talk talk to me about


---------32:57----------
judgment because you're so good at


---------32:58----------
telling me stories like tell me stories


---------33:00----------
bro


---------33:02----------
um that's a good question like where did


---------33:04----------
i learn about judgment i think like


---------33:07----------
just growing up and feeling like


---------33:10----------
i was you know feeling like i was poor


---------33:12----------
and so like always trying to


---------33:16----------
prove to people that i was maybe worth


---------33:18----------
like being like a friend of theirs you


---------33:20----------
know like


---------33:21----------
uh i remember in in junior high i


---------33:24----------
remember like there was this group of


---------33:26----------
friends


---------33:26----------
like because like growing up i was


---------33:27----------
really big into church


---------33:29----------
um and there was this group of friends


---------33:31----------
that i had in junior high


---------33:33----------
that i was like i knew


---------33:37----------
i should not be hanging out with these


---------33:38----------
kids like i i knew as far as far as what


---------33:41----------
my morals were like they were they were


---------33:42----------
like


---------33:43----------
people that were like already already


---------33:44----------
smoking a lot of pot they're already


---------33:46----------
like


---------33:46----------
talking about drugs all the time like


---------33:47----------
all this stuff that i personally like


---------33:49----------
was not into


---------33:50----------
and i didn't want to get into it but


---------33:52----------
they were cool


---------33:53----------
like they were the cool kids in school


---------33:55----------
and so the fact that they wanted me to


---------33:57----------
be a friend


---------33:58----------
um i was like okay well that that makes


---------34:01----------
me cool then


---------34:02----------
and i just i remember like there'd be a


---------34:05----------
lot of times where i would just


---------34:08----------
like one thing that i really really did


---------34:10----------
a lot


---------34:11----------
in junior high and in high school and


---------34:13----------
i'm not sure if this is answering your


---------34:14----------
question but this is just what


---------34:15----------
came to my mind is i was very good at


---------34:18----------
making fun of myself


---------34:19----------
and so i hated hated hated


---------34:23----------
if someone made fun of me like i did not


---------34:25----------
like that so


---------34:26----------
i was very lucky okay it was a


---------34:28----------
double-edged sword i was very lucky


---------34:30----------
because i didn't have a lot of people


---------34:32----------
make fun of me but the reason


---------34:34----------
was because i made fun of myself so much


---------34:36----------
and i've talked about this kind of


---------34:37----------
before it's like


---------34:38----------
so i would i would put on this mask of


---------34:41----------
i'm the funny fat guy that's what i


---------34:42----------
would call i'm the funny fat guy


---------34:44----------
i i have a i have a tattoo on my calf of


---------34:46----------
a cupcake


---------34:47----------
because my name in high school was


---------34:49----------
cupcake like everyone called me that


---------34:50----------
and like the reason i got that nickname


---------34:52----------
was because there's a group of people


---------34:54----------
that were trying to be mean to me


---------34:55----------
and make fun of me and call me cupcake


---------34:57----------
because i was fat and so i was like


---------34:59----------
i like that name and i i internalized it


---------35:02----------
and i like when i graduated they said


---------35:04----------
john david cupcake glad


---------35:06----------
like it was like everyone knew me as


---------35:07----------
cupcake in my high school right


---------35:09----------
and so i had this like mask on of i'm


---------35:11----------
the funny fat guy like


---------35:13----------
no one would make fun of me because i


---------35:14----------
was always doing it all the time


---------35:16----------
and so it was like the reason i say it


---------35:18----------
was a double-edged sword was because yes


---------35:19----------
no one made fun of me


---------35:20----------
but i also felt like i was garbage like


---------35:23----------
i felt


---------35:23----------
like because of how much i would make


---------35:25----------
fun of myself and how much i was a joke


---------35:27----------
i started to just believe you are a joke


---------35:29----------
like you're not worth anything like


---------35:31----------
you're worthless right


---------35:32----------
that's something that i like when i'm in


---------35:33----------
that mode that i was telling about like


---------35:35----------
that's the


---------35:36----------
first thing that comes into my mind is


---------35:37----------
you're worthless like it just pops up


---------35:39----------
and like i'll be like like i say when i


---------35:42----------
when i say that i


---------35:42----------
um the people that are closest to me get


---------35:44----------
the most of it like i'll be texting my


---------35:46----------
girlfriend and all of a sudden it's just


---------35:47----------
i'm worthless i'm a piece of crap


---------35:48----------
i'm garbage and it's like


---------35:52----------
and i'm like what it doesn't make any


---------35:54----------
sense looking back


---------35:56----------
but in the moment it's like why does it


---------35:59----------
make any sense


---------36:00----------
looking back because like


---------36:05----------
the john that we see now i guess you


---------36:07----------
said there's like three different


---------36:08----------
people right the john looking back is


---------36:10----------
like


---------36:12----------
you are like you've done so much like


---------36:14----------
you've you've been through so many


---------36:15----------
things and you've been able to get


---------36:16----------
through them


---------36:17----------
and you you've been able to help so many


---------36:19----------
people out like that's obviously not


---------36:20----------
true


---------36:21----------
but it's like when i'm in that mode


---------36:24----------
nothing


---------36:25----------
anyone says like any no matter how much


---------36:28----------
i care about you


---------36:29----------
know it doesn't matter like it just like


---------36:32----------
i've i've


---------36:33----------
seen other people explain it this way


---------36:34----------
like i feel numb is like


---------36:36----------
there's just it doesn't matter what


---------36:38----------
anyone says i am


---------36:40----------
this is what i am and it's the truth and


---------36:42----------
then it might be i wake up the next


---------36:43----------
morning and i look back and i'm like


---------36:45----------
okay


---------36:45----------
that's definitely not true or sometimes


---------36:47----------
it'll happen during the day and i all of


---------36:48----------
a sudden kind of


---------36:49----------
like i don't know what starts happening


---------36:51----------
but it's like i can start to see i get


---------36:54----------
so hyper focused on these thoughts


---------36:56----------
and then i start to be able to not be so


---------36:59----------
focused on them and think about other


---------37:00----------
things and


---------37:01----------
and then i'm like okay like that's not


---------37:05----------
that's not true um yeah i don't know if


---------37:08----------
that answered your question


---------37:09----------
answers so much but i have so many more


---------37:16----------
so so i i'm gonna say something a little


---------37:19----------
bit provocative but i think it's


---------37:20----------
important


---------37:20----------
to tease apart what you're saying okay


---------37:23----------
so when you say looking back it's just


---------37:24----------
not true i actually disagree with that


---------37:27----------
okay i think looking at the now it's not


---------37:29----------
true


---------37:31----------
but when you look into your past


---------37:34----------
you know 14 year old cupcake it was


---------37:37----------
absolutely true


---------37:41----------
right so so this is the first thing


---------37:42----------
you've got to understand john some of


---------37:44----------
the things in our mind and maybe i need


---------37:46----------
to just take a step back and explain


---------37:47----------
some concepts like teach


---------37:49----------
but some of the things in our mind so if


---------37:52----------
we think about like ptsd for example


---------37:54----------
okay so people have flashbacks so like


---------37:57----------
what happens in a flashback


---------37:59----------
so let's say that i'm you know i'm in a


---------38:02----------
war


---------38:03----------
and then like i experienced like a


---------38:05----------
combat situation where like one of my


---------38:07----------
friends gets


---------38:07----------
you know blown up by like a missile


---------38:11----------
like you know i use a drastic example


---------38:14----------
because i'm thinking about a particular


---------38:15----------
person who exemplified this


---------38:16----------
and then what happens is like when i'm


---------38:18----------
walking down the street if there's a


---------38:19----------
loud


---------38:20----------
bang what happens in my mind


---------38:24----------
so my mind transports me


---------38:27----------
to that point in the past


---------38:31----------
right and then like i have this thing


---------38:32----------
called a flashback


---------38:34----------
where like i i lose sight of where i am


---------38:37----------
i lose sight of who i am


---------38:38----------
i can be 70 years old and that have been


---------38:41----------
in the vietnam war


---------38:42----------
when i was 25 and when i hear a bang


---------38:46----------
i get transported i become that 25 year


---------38:49----------
old self


---------38:49----------
i don't become a grandfather who you


---------38:52----------
know has lived so much


---------38:53----------
i'm like a scared kid in like the


---------38:55----------
jungles of vietnam


---------38:57----------
where my friend just died in front of my


---------38:59----------
eyes that's what i've become


---------39:01----------
and so if we if we stop and think about


---------39:03----------
that like


---------39:05----------
hold on a second like that's weird right


---------39:07----------
so the first thing that we've got to


---------39:08----------
acknowledge


---------39:10----------
is that our mind and our brain has the


---------39:12----------
capacity


---------39:14----------
to transport us into the past


---------39:18----------
and this is the problem is that i think


---------39:19----------
part of the reason you're stuck is


---------39:21----------
because


---------39:21----------
you try to tell yourself that you're not


---------39:24----------
worthless


---------39:25----------
but you feel like you are worthless and


---------39:27----------
so so there's like this conflict where


---------39:29----------
you're like fighting against yourself


---------39:30----------
when you


---------39:31----------
fight against yourself you're not gonna


---------39:33----------
win


---------39:35----------
right it's kind of weird so so i think


---------39:37----------
in a bizarre way


---------39:38----------
like what you need to do is like


---------39:40----------
actually accept that


---------39:42----------
you were worthless and this is this is


---------39:45----------
that your road forward is like not to


---------39:46----------
say you weren't worthless because


---------39:48----------
that's how you felt it it's that you are


---------39:50----------
worthless and that's okay


---------39:53----------
right like if i think about it i was


---------39:55----------
just talking to


---------39:56----------
to someone about this recently but you


---------39:59----------
know if we think about


---------40:00----------
what you need to do for yourself john


---------40:02----------
it's like like when you call yourself


---------40:04----------
worthless like that's you judging


---------40:05----------
yourself


---------40:06----------
and then there's even like a fourth


---------40:08----------
reaction of and let me know if i lose


---------40:10----------
you here which is that you beat yourself


---------40:12----------
up for calling yourself worthless


---------40:16----------
so it doesn't matter how far you go down


---------40:18----------
the road


---------40:19----------
it's always you beating yourself up even


---------40:21----------
though it is cloaked in positivity


---------40:24----------
does that make sense yeah


---------40:27----------
and so so like you know there's a part


---------40:30----------
of me that says like


---------40:31----------
you know if i had to transport back in


---------40:32----------
time to cupcake


---------40:34----------
my message to cupcake is not you know


---------40:38----------
you're a beautiful person and and


---------40:41----------
like there's nothing wrong with you or


---------40:43----------
anything like that that's actually not


---------40:44----------
my message to him because i don't think


---------40:46----------
that that's a fair message


---------40:47----------
my message to him is hey man you got


---------40:49----------
like i know you're struggling right now


---------40:51----------
i know you're overweight i know a lot of


---------40:52----------
people


---------40:53----------
make fun of you and you make fun of


---------40:55----------
yourself


---------40:56----------
but i don't think i don't agree with


---------40:58----------
them i know you feel that way


---------41:01----------
but you won't be this way forever


---------41:04----------
and that if you work at it you can grow


---------41:07----------
and you can change


---------41:09----------
but right now i have no doubt that you


---------41:12----------
feel


---------41:12----------
absolutely worthless because you don't


---------41:14----------
get good grades kids make fun of you you


---------41:16----------
make fun of yourself and you're


---------41:17----------
overweight


---------41:18----------
so i see why you feel worthless because


---------41:20----------
you look around and you don't see any


---------41:21----------
value


---------41:22----------
i know it's in there you've just got to


---------41:26----------
work


---------41:26----------
to go from obese to beast right


---------41:30----------
and even then like i think that your


---------41:32----------
answer is actually in your name because


---------41:34----------
you don't say


---------41:35----------
beast always you are not always


---------41:38----------
right and and so so it's actually


---------41:40----------
beautiful because i think what resonates


---------41:42----------
john with like other people and what


---------41:43----------
makes you not an imposter


---------41:45----------
is that in your name you own


---------41:49----------
the obeseness you own it but when you


---------41:52----------
start beating yourself up and you start


---------41:54----------
feeling that way


---------41:56----------
it's like beast back to obese in your


---------41:58----------
mind but like that's okay you've got to


---------42:00----------
own like


---------42:01----------
you're you're the spectrum right you've


---------42:04----------
got to balance like


---------42:06----------
the confidence that you have it's not


---------42:08----------
about like one winning over the other


---------42:11----------
it's like balancing both of those things


---------42:13----------
together


---------42:15----------
that make sense yeah what what are you


---------42:19----------
hearing


---------42:22----------
like i can't like if i


---------42:26----------
if i i have to i guess what i'm hearing


---------42:29----------
is like you have to live in that moment


---------42:31----------
sometimes like you can't like i'm


---------42:32----------
beating myself up for


---------42:34----------
like i'm telling myself i'm worthless so


---------42:36----------
that's in turn obviously that's beating


---------42:38----------
myself up


---------42:38----------
but then i am also beating myself up


---------42:41----------
after the fact


---------42:42----------
because i am saying why would you say


---------42:44----------
that that's not true


---------42:45----------
so now i'm like being myself well that's


---------42:47----------
stupid and you're being stupid and


---------42:48----------
you're being childish


---------42:50----------
there it is right so it's the same thing


---------42:53----------
it's just


---------42:53----------
layers and layers and layers and layers


---------42:55----------
of the same


---------42:57----------
complex which is that john you're not


---------43:00----------
good enough


---------43:02----------
even when you are trying to be positive


---------43:04----------
towards yourself that's


---------43:06----------
actually negative does that make sense


---------43:08----------
you're like


---------43:09----------
you've accomplished so much why are you


---------43:12----------
so


---------43:12----------
dumb that you can't see it yeah


---------43:15----------
you're still calling yourself it's the


---------43:17----------
same [ __ ] thing it's like


---------43:19----------
you know and so so so


---------43:23----------
that's what needs to change and the way


---------43:26----------
that we start changing that is to is to


---------43:28----------
think a little bit about like


---------43:29----------
you know to say that okay i i sometimes


---------43:32----------
i feel worthless like that's cool


---------43:34----------
right just because i feel that way and


---------43:36----------
because even i know this sounds crazy


---------43:39----------
even if i am that way right now it


---------43:42----------
doesn't have to be that way forever


---------43:43----------
because that's a statement you can get


---------43:45----------
behind


---------43:46----------
[Music]


---------43:48----------
right if you if you find yourself


---------43:50----------
retreating from your friends and your


---------43:52----------
family and girlfriend and whatnot


---------43:54----------
you can say okay sometimes i've got a


---------43:56----------
retreat because that's who i am


---------43:59----------
you know i i i've grown in a lot of ways


---------44:02----------
i haven't quite grown in this


---------44:05----------
and just because you haven't learned it


---------44:06----------
yet john ballpark how old you are


---------44:10----------
i'm about to be 28 in a few days okay


---------44:12----------
cool so like you just think about that


---------44:14----------
right like think about where you were


---------44:16----------
when you were 18.


---------44:19----------
where you were five years ago you've


---------44:22----------
accomplished


---------44:23----------
so much in the last five to ten years


---------44:27----------
and you've got at least 40 good years


---------44:29----------
ahead of you


---------44:31----------
and so you may feel worthless now and


---------44:34----------
you may beat yourself up but


---------44:35----------
you can learn how to not beat yourself


---------44:37----------
up over the next decade it's really cool


---------44:39----------
to beat yourself up


---------44:41----------
give yourself some time give yourself


---------44:43----------
some space


---------44:45----------
you know and and like you've you've made


---------44:48----------
one transformation in your body and for


---------44:50----------
the next decade of your life you're


---------44:51----------
going to focus on a transformation of


---------44:52----------
mind


---------44:54----------
and you have to accept that you're


---------44:56----------
overweight like


---------44:58----------
right but you have to start with the


---------44:59----------
acceptance that you are overweight and


---------45:01----------
so i think you can also start with the


---------45:02----------
acceptance that


---------45:04----------
mentally like you do things to yourself


---------45:06----------
which are not ideal


---------45:08----------
but that's actually okay yeah


---------45:13----------
right because you've got you've got the


---------45:14----------
beast working with you


---------45:17----------
yeah i think like just


---------45:20----------
for me to help me kind of process this


---------45:22----------
the way i


---------45:23----------
like what i'm hearing and like what what


---------45:25----------
i'm hearing is so i get a lot of people


---------45:27----------
that will ask me


---------45:29----------
i want to lose weight and i want it like


---------45:30----------
i want to lose 50 pounds in a month or


---------45:32----------
whatever


---------45:32----------
and i always have to say it it takes


---------45:34----------
time like it's not gonna happen


---------45:35----------
overnight


---------45:36----------
and so i haven't turned like i believe


---------45:38----------
that right but i think with


---------45:40----------
the stuff that we're talking about i get


---------45:41----------
frustrated that i i'm like that person


---------45:44----------
that's asking me the question to you is


---------45:46----------
like fix me right now i would like to


---------45:48----------
have everything


---------45:49----------
figured out and and i'm like when


---------45:51----------
they're asking me i'm like yo that's not


---------45:52----------
gonna


---------45:52----------
it just doesn't work like that it's


---------45:54----------
gonna take a long time and i


---------45:56----------
am it's funny because i'm like being


---------45:57----------
that person to you almost


---------45:59----------
sure is like how can i fix this right


---------46:00----------
now and then you're just like it's gonna


---------46:02----------
take a while man


---------46:03----------
so that's interesting to hear yeah so so


---------46:06----------
i i think it's interesting that that's


---------46:08----------
what you took away


---------46:10----------
and i think that actually demonstrates


---------46:12----------
to me that you understand it already


---------46:16----------
right so i i think that that what you


---------46:18----------
need to do is like just like you


---------46:19----------
encourage those other people to give


---------46:21----------
themselves time and be patient with


---------46:22----------
themselves


---------46:23----------
give yourself time and be patient with


---------46:26----------
this


---------46:28----------
um yeah that's that's


---------46:33----------
that's very well said john let me just


---------46:36----------
think any questions


---------46:39----------
not really i mean i'm sure i'll have


---------46:41----------
some stuff when we're towards the end


---------46:43----------
but right now i'm kind of


---------46:44----------
enjoying kind of working through it okay


---------46:47----------
yeah


---------46:48----------
so um let me just


---------46:51----------
think for a second about where to go


---------46:53----------
from here


---------46:59----------
okay so we can we can do a couple of


---------47:01----------
things either we can dig


---------47:02----------
further let me just teach you a couple


---------47:05----------
things actually okay


---------47:06----------
okay and then you tell me what you're


---------47:07----------
interested in


---------47:09----------
so let's talk about the mind body


---------47:10----------
connection for a minute so the first


---------47:12----------
thing


---------47:13----------
is that um you know i think there's a


---------47:16----------
part of you that


---------47:17----------
feels stupid right so like the part that


---------47:21----------
couldn't do multiplication the part that


---------47:23----------
couldn't


---------47:24----------
um read music and and maybe this makes


---------47:27----------
you feel like an imposter so let me just


---------47:29----------
start by saying john


---------47:31----------
i think that


---------47:34----------
we have this idea that some people are


---------47:35----------
smart and some people are stupid but


---------47:37----------
what i really like from eastern medicine


---------47:39----------
is that they say that they're different


---------47:40----------
kinds of minds


---------47:42----------
right just like they're different colors


---------47:43----------
of hair they're like different kinds of


---------47:45----------
minds


---------47:46----------
and some minds aren't great at like book


---------47:50----------
smarts


---------47:51----------
and some minds are not designed to sit


---------47:54----------
in a classroom for like eight hours a


---------47:56----------
day and like look at a textbook


---------47:58----------
it doesn't mean that they're stupid it


---------48:01----------
just means that your mind is different


---------48:03----------
and i think that like so one of my


---------48:05----------
teachers explained this to me like there


---------48:06----------
are some people who are hunters and some


---------48:08----------
people who are farmers


---------48:10----------
and the farmer mind like likes to wake


---------48:12----------
up at the same time every day


---------48:13----------
likes to sit in their chair read their


---------48:15----------
book like like routine like everything's


---------48:17----------
the same like


---------48:19----------
i don't like disruptions i can just i


---------48:21----------
love multiplication i love reading music


---------48:23----------
i love anything


---------48:24----------
on a page that i can read and no one


---------48:27----------
bothers me


---------48:28----------
and then there are hunters and hunters


---------48:30----------
are like i'm not going to sit around and


---------48:31----------
like sow seeds every day i want to be


---------48:33----------
out in the wilderness i want to be


---------48:34----------
looking around


---------48:35----------
i want to absorb a lot of stimuli i want


---------48:37----------
to integrate a lot of stimuli


---------48:39----------
i want to make a lot of decisions with a


---------48:41----------
lot of uncertainty like which way do i


---------48:43----------
go is this


---------48:43----------
dangerous is this not dangerous it's


---------48:45----------
just different kinds of minds


---------48:48----------
and and i don't know i mean do either of


---------48:51----------
those mindsets resonate with you


---------48:54----------
i mean the hunter one definitely is is


---------48:56----------
where


---------48:57----------
it's it's interesting because there's


---------48:59----------
like parts of each i guess


---------49:01----------
um so for me like routine is like it's


---------49:04----------
very important to me like i


---------49:05----------
when i when i am thrown off of my


---------49:07----------
routine that is definitely like i've


---------49:09----------
noticed that's a trigger of my anxiety


---------49:10----------
like it definitely can make me


---------49:12----------
anxious but at the same time like i


---------49:15----------
when i was a kid i was like diagnosed


---------49:16----------
with add and like i took woodland for a


---------49:18----------
little bit


---------49:19----------
um and so i'm definitely very like i


---------49:22----------
like to


---------49:22----------
to do things though like i like to um


---------49:25----------
like


---------49:26----------
i can't just do one thing forever like


---------49:27----------
i'm sure you've noticed like


---------49:29----------
i'm always fidgeting i'm always messing


---------49:30----------
with something it's just how i am


---------49:32----------
yeah um and so it's interesting but i


---------49:35----------
would say


---------49:36----------
i i probably would lean more towards


---------49:39----------
like the hunter


---------49:40----------
in that explanation i guess yeah so so


---------49:44----------
it's it's not


---------49:45----------
they're not mutually exclusive first of


---------49:47----------
all and there actually are three


---------49:49----------
not two so it's like a three-dimensional


---------49:50----------
thing um but


---------49:52----------
i i think you know just one thing to


---------49:54----------
that i would encourage you to just kind


---------49:56----------
of


---------49:56----------
potentially re-conceptualize your


---------49:58----------
upbringing is that like


---------50:00----------
um and i wouldn't quite go as far as to


---------50:02----------
say that you weren't book smart i think


---------50:03----------
you just you probably needed a more


---------50:05----------
dynamic learning environment


---------50:07----------
or frankly just more like one-on-one


---------50:10----------
attention


---------50:11----------
so there's a there's an interesting kind


---------50:13----------
of statistic it's a little bit


---------50:15----------
i'm extrapolating a little bit but


---------50:17----------
basically what we find is that


---------50:19----------
kids who are the less attention


---------50:23----------
an individual child has the more likely


---------50:26----------
they are to be diagnosed with adhd


---------50:30----------
so growing up it sounds like you were in


---------50:31----------
a single parent household with


---------50:33----------
with two siblings and and so what i what


---------50:36----------
i find


---------50:37----------
frankly as a clinician is that there are


---------50:39----------
some kids who are highly highly dynamic


---------50:41----------
and actually incredibly smart and


---------50:44----------
whether they go down the path of special


---------50:46----------
needs and adhd


---------50:47----------
or not has nothing to do with like their


---------50:50----------
intellect it has


---------50:51----------
everything to do with the amount of


---------50:53----------
individual attention that they can get


---------50:56----------
and if you can have because actually


---------50:57----------
what happens with with really smart kids


---------50:59----------
is they get


---------51:00----------
bored easily in class right and then


---------51:02----------
they start to fidget


---------51:03----------
whereas if you have someone who can


---------51:05----------
engage them in kind of a dynamic way


---------51:07----------
the kid is going to be like awesome like


---------51:09----------
they're going to be fantastic


---------51:11----------
you'll let their brilliance like kind of


---------51:13----------
flourish they just need a different kind


---------51:14----------
of soil


---------51:17----------
and what i'm hearing from you is that


---------51:18----------
probably the most likely thing is that


---------51:20----------
you weren't given the right kind of soil


---------51:22----------
that you needed to grow


---------51:24----------
and now i think part of the reason that


---------51:26----------
you're so successful is because you've


---------51:28----------
figured out oh like minimum wage job is


---------51:30----------
not going to be


---------51:31----------
i'm not the guy who gets like minimum


---------51:32----------
wage job and then becomes a manager


---------51:35----------
and then becomes a vp and that like


---------51:38----------
you'd [ __ ]


---------51:39----------
f that [ __ ] right it's like a little bit


---------51:41----------
of youtube video


---------51:42----------
a little bit of physical activity i'm


---------51:44----------
gonna cook this today


---------51:45----------
i'm gonna take these pictures for


---------51:46----------
instagram i'm gonna answer some


---------51:48----------
questions


---------51:49----------
you're like a hunter you're like out


---------51:50----------
there and you're like oh there's a track


---------51:52----------
over here what is this i smell something


---------51:53----------
over here


---------51:54----------
oh there's some like you know poop over


---------51:56----------
there like


---------51:57----------
you're you're kind of integrating a


---------51:58----------
bunch of information i think that's just


---------52:00----------
the fertile soil that you need


---------52:02----------
um and i i think for a lot of people out


---------52:04----------
there like this is important to remember


---------52:06----------
is that like if you got diagnosed and


---------52:07----------
you felt dumb


---------52:09----------
it's not so much that you were dumb or


---------52:10----------
that you're mentally ill


---------52:12----------
it's just that like there's a different


---------52:14----------
kind of environment that that child


---------52:16----------
needs to thrive


---------52:19----------
um any thoughts about that


---------52:23----------
no i mean i i agree and i think that


---------52:26----------
i mean there were things that um my like


---------52:29----------
the teachers would try and do when i was


---------52:31----------
in


---------52:32----------
in school like there was uh i also have


---------52:34----------
like dysgraphia so like


---------52:36----------
my handwriting is absolutely so bad um


---------52:39----------
so they would like try


---------52:40----------
it sucks because my handwriting's really


---------52:42----------
bad but i'm also unbelievably slow at


---------52:44----------
typing like i type like 20 to 30 words a


---------52:46----------
minute like it's really bad


---------52:47----------
but they ended up giving me this like


---------52:49----------
little it was before like computers and


---------52:51----------
laptops were like that people had them


---------52:52----------
so there's this little like machine that


---------52:54----------
they had that they would give me so i


---------52:55----------
could type instead of trying right


---------52:57----------
and i remember like i knew that they


---------52:58----------
were trying to give me this thing to


---------53:00----------
help


---------53:00----------
but i remember it felt like it made


---------53:02----------
things harder for me and then i was like


---------53:04----------
even this help that they're trying to


---------53:06----------
give me is making me


---------53:08----------
feel worse right yep um and i just i


---------53:11----------
remember feeling like


---------53:12----------
like i mean this is when i was like


---------53:14----------
young i was i was


---------53:15----------
i was in like elementary school at this


---------53:16----------
time and uh


---------53:18----------
and then they were like i remember there


---------53:20----------
were things where they would have like a


---------53:21----------
person come in and grab me


---------53:23----------
um i'm not sure if this was to do with


---------53:25----------
my learning disability if it was like


---------53:27----------
home


---------53:27----------
stuff because of the drugs but they


---------53:30----------
would like bring me into a room where it


---------53:31----------
was just me and this person


---------53:33----------
it was like during math class like math


---------53:35----------
class when i was really young


---------53:36----------
and they would bring me in there and


---------53:37----------
then we would do different types of math


---------53:39----------
so we would like work with blocks or


---------53:40----------
work with like


---------53:41----------
you know what i mean like and it would


---------53:42----------
be one-on-one instead of just like the


---------53:45----------
the class um i remember that but i do


---------53:48----------
remember


---------53:50----------
at that whole little typing thing


---------53:53----------
and feeling like this is supposed to


---------53:54----------
help and it's not helping made me feel


---------53:56----------
like well you're just kind of a lost


---------53:58----------
cause


---------53:58----------
when i was like you know in like super


---------54:01----------
super young


---------54:02----------
and i remember that being like tough for


---------54:04----------
me yeah so let's think about that for a


---------54:06----------
second john once again


---------54:08----------
wonderful dude the way your mind forms


---------54:10----------
connections is really amazing and you're


---------54:12----------
just a fantastic storyteller


---------54:13----------
so so let me ask you something john


---------54:16----------
think about the way that you felt


---------54:18----------
when they get gave you that typing


---------54:19----------
machine and it like still didn't help


---------54:22----------
and how you feel when you have a panic


---------54:24----------
attack


---------54:25----------
oh it's it's exactly the same man like


---------54:28----------
it's


---------54:29----------
it's it's so much the same that i


---------54:32----------
remember


---------54:33----------
i recently was like telling people i was


---------54:36----------
in my discord and i was like hey you


---------54:37----------
know i'm trying to work on my typing


---------54:39----------
and i like i shared out like where i'm


---------54:41----------
at and it was like 30 minutes


---------54:44----------
it made me like it it made me cry and


---------54:46----------
i'm like tearing up thinking about it


---------54:47----------
because people started like sharing


---------54:50----------
it's so silly uh people started sharing


---------54:52----------
their how fast they were and they were


---------54:54----------
like how are you so slow that's


---------54:55----------
ridiculous


---------54:56----------
and i just remember i just felt like the


---------54:58----------
kid again and i just


---------55:00----------
shrunk back and i was just like i don't


---------55:03----------
it made me


---------55:04----------
because i like to share a lot but then


---------55:06----------
at the same time like sometimes when i


---------55:07----------
share stuff


---------55:08----------
people will say that stuff and i know


---------55:10----------
that they weren't trying to mean of


---------55:11----------
course they're not


---------55:12----------
but it made me feel so small and it was


---------55:15----------
like


---------55:16----------
i am that i am the same like nothing has


---------55:19----------
changed like it makes me


---------55:20----------
feel like nothing has changed and i'm


---------55:21----------
still that person and i just remember


---------55:23----------
like


---------55:24----------
honestly like you were saying there was


---------55:26----------
anger i was mad like i was mad at those


---------55:28----------
people and i wanted to like ban


---------55:29----------
them or i wanted to like reply and i was


---------55:32----------
kind of saucy a little bit


---------55:33----------
but like i wanted to be like you don't


---------55:35----------
know what i'm dealing with you don't


---------55:36----------
understand how hard this is for me


---------55:38----------
but i was just like i'm not gonna do


---------55:39----------
that like it's it's not like


---------55:41----------
i tried to take a step back and be like


---------55:43----------
okay let's think rationally here


---------55:45----------
they're not trying to be mean to you


---------55:46----------
like you are


---------55:48----------
this is your perception of the situation


---------55:50----------
but i just remember like that little


---------55:52----------
thing man


---------55:53----------
like it really messed with me it really


---------55:56----------
it


---------55:56----------
messed with it just made it made me feel


---------55:59----------
stupid is the


---------56:00----------
is like the most that's the easiest way


---------56:02----------
to kind of explain it


---------56:04----------
yeah it's it's uh once again a beautiful


---------56:08----------
insight into


---------56:09----------
you know a painful thing john because i


---------56:12----------
i think that the takeaway there is like


---------56:14----------
once again what you're feeling john


---------56:16----------
is not you it's an echo


---------56:20----------
right that hurt you carry with you


---------56:22----------
because it's never been processed


---------56:25----------
and if you want to be free of it you


---------56:27----------
have to like process it so let me ask


---------56:28----------
you this


---------56:29----------
how did you feel towards the people who


---------56:31----------
brought you the typing machine


---------56:39----------
i think initially i felt special


---------56:43----------
because it was like wow this is like


---------56:44----------
again it was before


---------56:46----------
there was a lot of stuff like that out


---------56:47----------
there so i was like oh i have this cool


---------56:49----------
thing


---------56:50----------
but then it started to feel almost like


---------56:52----------
a scarlet letter


---------56:53----------
um because everyone else is writing and


---------56:56----------
i have this machine


---------56:58----------
but then i felt like okay my teachers


---------57:00----------
now are probably gonna think okay he's


---------57:01----------
gonna do better but i was so


---------57:03----------
unbelievably slow at it that it was like


---------57:05----------
this


---------57:06----------
machine that they gave me to help is


---------57:08----------
making me i feel like it's making me


---------57:10----------
feel worse


---------57:11----------
so at the start it felt nice because i


---------57:12----------
felt special but then it felt


---------57:15----------
i just started to feel worse and worse


---------57:16----------
and worse because


---------57:18----------
and then it was like i wanted to prove


---------57:20----------
to these people that i like


---------57:21----------
i should have this but i just and so it


---------57:23----------
just became like this kind of thing of


---------57:25----------
shame that i had


---------57:26----------
eventually i just stopped using it


---------57:27----------
because i was like well this isn't


---------57:28----------
helping me at all


---------57:30----------
okay how many other people when they


---------57:34----------
graduated had a nickname


---------57:36----------
read out no one there's your scarlet


---------57:39----------
letter


---------57:44----------
so so like i was saying uh you know just


---------57:46----------
to recap you had sort of said that you


---------57:48----------
felt like


---------57:49----------
i'd asked you about the um


---------57:53----------
i had asked you about you know what it


---------57:55----------
felt like to have the


---------57:57----------
the typewriter or whatever and then you


---------58:00----------
kind of felt like they labeled you with


---------58:02----------
something different


---------58:03----------
yeah and you had a scarlet letter and


---------58:06----------
then i had asked the question for people


---------58:07----------
who missed it


---------58:08----------
um you know how many people had a


---------58:11----------
nickname when they graduated


---------58:14----------
and then you'd said none um and i think


---------58:17----------
that's just an example of you


---------58:18----------
solidifying your isolation from


---------58:20----------
the rest of the world right and you kind


---------58:23----------
of owning that part but at the end of


---------58:24----------
the day


---------58:25----------
you're still isolating yourself and i


---------58:28----------
think that


---------58:29----------
part of you know i i'd imagine that when


---------58:32----------
you feel worthless when you have that


---------58:34----------
kind of panic attack you also feel


---------58:36----------
incredibly incredibly isolated oh yeah


---------58:39----------
yeah yeah and that no one understands


---------58:42----------
you


---------58:45----------
um can you tell me a little bit about


---------58:48----------
those feelings or explain those or just


---------58:50----------
share with us what it feels like when


---------58:51----------
you have these panic attacks


---------58:55----------
yeah i can try um


---------58:58----------
it feels like i said it


---------59:01----------
like there's this numbness where it's


---------59:03----------
like no matter what anyone says to me


---------59:05----------
no matter any it just doesn't matter


---------59:07----------
like i can


---------59:10----------
like i said i struggle with being still


---------59:12----------
and like not


---------59:13----------
you know like my 80d but like when i'm


---------59:15----------
in this mode i


---------59:16----------
can be dead still staring at a wall for


---------59:20----------
an


---------59:20----------
hour not even thinking about it like i


---------59:23----------
don't


---------59:24----------
it's this crazy feeling of like i just


---------59:26----------
feel like


---------59:27----------
nothing matters like nothing matters no


---------59:30----------
nothing anyone says matters and um


---------59:34----------
i just start i'll end up i guess the


---------59:37----------
i've heard the word catastrophizing so


---------59:39----------
like i feel like i'll


---------59:41----------
end up trying to find the worst


---------59:44----------
things things that can make me feel the


---------59:46----------
worst and then i focus on those things


---------59:49----------
and so like i'm intentionally being i'll


---------59:51----------
intentionally be really mean to myself


---------59:53----------
and this is where i say like i'm mean to


---------59:55----------
other people because again obviously if


---------59:57----------
i'm close to someone and they know this


---------59:58----------
is going on they're trying to reach out


---------60:00----------
and help


---------60:00----------
my girlfriend is the person that comes


---------60:02----------
to mind and i'm just like


---------60:04----------
super dismissive and i'm just like i'm


---------60:07----------
this i'm worthless i'm


---------60:08----------
a piece of garbage like i'll say these


---------60:10----------
things that are just so


---------60:11----------
mean like that you know if someone were


---------60:14----------
to say it to me i'd be like screw you


---------60:15----------
man like what are you talking about


---------60:17----------
but like i have no problem saying it to


---------60:19----------
myself


---------60:20----------
and but i would say like the thing that


---------60:23----------
it's like the world kind of like i don't


---------60:25----------
know if you had the


---------60:25----------
um the new airpods but like the new


---------60:28----------
airpods are noise cancelling


---------60:29----------
you put them in they make like this


---------60:31----------
that's what it feels like


---------60:32----------
that's how i feel like the world that's


---------60:34----------
what i feel like happens to the world


---------60:36----------
when i'm having those feelings i can


---------60:38----------
almost like hear that


---------60:40----------
sound and then the noise cancellation is


---------60:42----------
there and but instead of noise


---------60:43----------
cancellation it's like world


---------60:45----------
cancellation


---------60:46----------
where anything else that's going on


---------60:48----------
doesn't matter


---------60:49----------
uh like there could be bombs going off


---------60:51----------
next door and i'm like i don't freaking


---------60:53----------
care


---------60:53----------
you know yeah john honestly it's bizarre


---------60:56----------
but this sounds to me like a


---------60:57----------
like when i've worked with people with


---------60:59----------
ptsd and they have flashbacks


---------61:01----------
it sounds like a flashback right so so i


---------61:04----------
work with someone who's a teacher


---------61:06----------
and then something happened in school


---------61:08----------
and they like jumped under their desk


---------61:11----------
right and like they weren't in school


---------61:13----------
anymore like the rest of the world


---------61:15----------
disappears and they're like trapped in


---------61:18----------
their own mind


---------61:20----------
and and that's honestly what it sounds


---------61:22----------
like to me like you become sort of


---------61:24----------
trapped


---------61:24----------
within your own mind and it seems like a


---------61:27----------
really dark


---------61:28----------
place yeah i mean it can be in those


---------61:32----------
i mean it certainly can be in those


---------61:34----------
moments like that's why i said i feel


---------61:36----------
like i'm a different person because it's


---------61:37----------
like


---------61:38----------
my mind changes as well yep um


---------61:41----------
there's only been like those happen i


---------61:43----------
don't want to say they happen like super


---------61:44----------
frequently it'll be maybe


---------61:46----------
once a month or something like that i've


---------61:47----------
only had one time where i genuinely felt


---------61:49----------
like i was having a panic attack


---------61:53----------
um where i remember it was towards like


---------61:56----------
the beginning of


---------61:59----------
the beginning of quarantine um and i


---------62:02----------
remember


---------62:03----------
i had injured my back doing a workout


---------62:06----------
and so i was


---------62:07----------
i was very like immobile at the time and


---------62:10----------
i know for me working out is a huge


---------62:12----------
form of stress release for me like it


---------62:14----------
i've noticed that


---------62:16----------
for sure um and so i was dealing with a


---------62:18----------
back injury and i remember i


---------62:21----------
i was in the shower and then i remember


---------62:24----------
thinking


---------62:25----------
wow i'm like it's like really hard to


---------62:26----------
breathe right now like i'm like


---------62:28----------
something's kind of going on like my


---------62:30----------
head feels kind of weird


---------62:31----------
and i remember i uh i ended up getting


---------62:35----------
out of the shower and i got into my bed


---------62:37----------
i didn't i didn't even dry myself off


---------62:39----------
because i was like i feel like really


---------62:40----------
weird and then i got into my bed and


---------62:43----------
then i remember


---------62:44----------
i was like oh i think i might i think


---------62:45----------
i'm gonna throw up so then i went back


---------62:47----------
i went back into the bathroom and laid


---------62:49----------
by the toilet


---------62:51----------
and i i remember just like i felt like i


---------62:54----------
was going to die


---------62:55----------
like it really felt like i felt like i


---------62:57----------
could i could


---------62:58----------
the reason i brought up it was the


---------62:59----------
beginning of quarantine was because i


---------63:00----------
was like i was like super stressed out


---------63:02----------
about coronavirus i was like what


---------63:03----------
i could do am i like every day i felt


---------63:06----------
like i think i have it i think i have it


---------63:07----------
and i would be like stressed out about


---------63:09----------
it


---------63:09----------
so then i was like i was like checking i


---------63:10----------
was like doing the whole thing where i'd


---------63:11----------
like hold my breath


---------63:12----------
and like oh can i still breathe and then


---------63:14----------
i was like i was super


---------63:16----------
super worried about that and then


---------63:19----------
i started like feeling like i could feel


---------63:21----------
like my heartbeat in my ever


---------63:23----------
everything like i just felt like my


---------63:24----------
whole heart was being and i genuinely


---------63:26----------
was like i think i'm i think i'm gonna


---------63:28----------
die right now


---------63:29----------
like i was i seriously thought i was


---------63:31----------
going to die


---------63:32----------
um and i remember i ended up like i was


---------63:35----------
just lit i just laid in my bathroom


---------63:37----------
for a while and then i finally started


---------63:40----------
to like like i said like the the noise


---------63:42----------
cancellation kind of started to lift


---------63:44----------
and i could like stand up but it was


---------63:46----------
like that's only happened to me one time


---------63:48----------
but it was like


---------63:49----------
the scariest thing i think i've ever


---------63:51----------
i've ever been through


---------63:53----------
um but those like other moments that


---------63:56----------
i've talked about frequently they happen


---------63:58----------
you know like pretty frequently i guess


---------64:00----------
like once a month once every few weeks


---------64:02----------
yeah so


---------64:03----------
john thank you for sharing that just a


---------64:04----------
couple of thoughts so the first is that


---------64:07----------
it sounds like it was quite profound and


---------64:11----------
powerful of an experience


---------64:13----------
yeah and yet my preference would be to


---------64:16----------
focus on the other ones because those


---------64:18----------
happen more frequently yeah


---------64:19----------
yeah yeah i think that it just came to


---------64:21----------
my mind no no i'm glad you shared it the


---------64:23----------
other thing that i would tell you is


---------64:24----------
that really does sound like a panic


---------64:25----------
attack


---------64:26----------
so yeah that's nothing nothing you have


---------64:28----------
said so far has made me think


---------64:31----------
you need to uh potentially an evaluation


---------64:33----------
or treatment


---------64:35----------
for an actual like illness um


---------64:38----------
but i i would say to you at this point


---------64:40----------
that you know if that kind of thing


---------64:42----------
continues to happen you should


---------64:44----------
absolutely go see a doctor about it


---------64:46----------
yeah okay so for people who don't know


---------64:48----------
just a real quick


---------64:49----------
reason to go see a doctor is that so one


---------64:51----------
of the hallmarks of panic attacks is a


---------64:53----------
sense of what they call


---------64:54----------
impending doom so people like actually


---------64:57----------
think


---------64:58----------
that they're gonna die and so it's it's


---------65:00----------
a strange thing to ask someone but


---------65:01----------
sometimes i'll ask people


---------65:03----------
do you have a sense of impending doom


---------65:04----------
and if people have panic attacks they're


---------65:05----------
like [ __ ] yeah that's it that's what it


---------65:06----------
is


---------65:08----------
like it's like it's a sense of impending


---------65:10----------
like this


---------65:11----------
is real and i'm gonna die now and


---------65:14----------
and that's what happens and it's


---------65:15----------
essentially a physiologic response right


---------65:17----------
so like your


---------65:18----------
your your adrenaline is through the roof


---------65:20----------
and things like that and then


---------65:23----------
all your danger circuitry lights up in


---------65:25----------
your brain


---------65:26----------
and then like this is the part of your


---------65:27----------
brain that like warns you about death


---------65:30----------
and and the problem is that normally


---------65:32----------
that part of your brain


---------65:33----------
only activates when there is impending


---------65:36----------
death


---------65:37----------
yeah but what's happened is that our


---------65:39----------
brain now lives in a society


---------65:41----------
that we have not evolved to live in and


---------65:43----------
so sometimes that circuit of our like oh


---------65:45----------
[ __ ] we're gonna die circuit


---------65:47----------
that's the technical neuroscientific


---------65:48----------
term that circuit sometimes


---------65:51----------
activates inappropriately because it


---------65:53----------
doesn't have like tigers and stuff to


---------65:55----------
worry about


---------65:56----------
so it activates in relation to like


---------65:58----------
paying rent at the end of the month


---------66:00----------
and other things like that but if that


---------66:03----------
continues


---------66:04----------
the reason that i'd really recommend


---------66:05----------
that you get evaluated for is because


---------66:06----------
there are like treatments


---------66:08----------
for that so that you don't have to


---------66:10----------
continue feeling that way


---------66:12----------
um what brings on the other episodes


---------66:15----------
like the episodes that you say happen


---------66:16----------
once a month where you feel really


---------66:18----------
isolated can you tell us about that


---------66:21----------
yeah i mean it's it's so many things


---------66:23----------
like it can be so many things i think


---------66:25----------
it's


---------66:26----------
uh like you it was that that one moment


---------66:28----------
i talked about with the keyboard


---------66:29----------
right with the typewriting um it's it's


---------66:31----------
like moments where


---------66:33----------
uh i might be like talking to


---------66:38----------
my my girlfriend and she might


---------66:41----------
i i feel so bad that it's she has to


---------66:43----------
deal with it so often but like


---------66:45----------
she might say something like something


---------66:47----------
little


---------66:48----------
and then i just start to


---------66:51----------
i so okay i mean i feel bad that i'm


---------66:54----------
sharing this but


---------66:55----------
um she'll say something about like an x


---------66:57----------
or a guy was like


---------66:58----------
being weird to her at the gym and that


---------67:00----------
stuff like makes me


---------67:02----------
feel like i guess i guess it is um


---------67:05----------
jealousy which we've talked about and


---------67:07----------
she's like you know i'm jealous too so


---------67:08----------
it makes me feel a little bit better


---------67:09----------
about it but it's like


---------67:10----------
i can understand why she would be


---------67:12----------
jealous


---------67:14----------
yeah yeah so like it and and so i


---------67:17----------
start to feel like okay like someone's


---------67:20----------
going to


---------67:21----------
like be better and then she's going to


---------67:23----------
like them more and then i start to feel


---------67:25----------
this way


---------67:26----------
and then i start treating her um


---------67:29----------
poorly you know what i mean not like i'm


---------67:31----------
not being mean to her but i'm just


---------67:33----------
super shut off and then i'm saying all


---------67:35----------
of these thoughts that i was that i was


---------67:36----------
explaining i'm like i'm worthless all


---------67:38----------
this stuff


---------67:38----------
and then it like it's frustrating oh man


---------67:41----------
we've dealt with


---------67:42----------
we've dealt with this a few times that's


---------67:43----------
why i'm getting so heated like it's


---------67:44----------
frustrating because then


---------67:46----------
of course she's like well i don't want


---------67:48----------
to share a lot of stuff with you if it's


---------67:50----------
going to make you feel this way


---------67:51----------
and then that makes me feel bad because


---------67:53----------
she's right


---------67:54----------
and i'm like well if you don't feel like


---------67:57----------
you can share things with me


---------67:58----------
what good am i as a boyfriend and then


---------68:01----------
like that's happened a few times


---------68:03----------
um and i mean there's there honestly


---------68:06----------
like it could be


---------68:07----------
almost anything if i'm in this if i'm in


---------68:10----------
the mood i guess or if i'm in a place


---------68:12----------
where it might happen


---------68:13----------
anything really can trigger it like it


---------68:15----------
can it could genuinely be anything i


---------68:17----------
remember


---------68:18----------
i was streaming one night and uh a bunch


---------68:21----------
of people came in and they spammed


---------68:23----------
very not okay words um and


---------68:26----------
i remember i was freaked out and then i


---------68:30----------
started being like you


---------68:31----------
idiot you should have made it so they


---------68:34----------
couldn't have done that like you should


---------68:35----------
have made it so they couldn't join the


---------68:36----------
discord and say all that stuff like this


---------68:38----------
is your fault and like like i said it it


---------68:40----------
can literally be anything that might


---------68:42----------
make me feel kind of stupid i guess is


---------68:43----------
the best way to explain it


---------68:45----------
okay so that that's useful so let's talk


---------68:49----------
about


---------68:49----------
a couple of things right so one thing


---------68:52----------
that sometimes happens when we feel bad


---------68:53----------
about ourselves


---------68:54----------
is we try to push people away and it


---------68:57----------
sounds like


---------68:58----------
you know you try to push your girlfriend


---------69:00----------
away and you're like if you feel that


---------69:01----------
way i don't even know why you're with me


---------69:02----------
i'm worthless piece of [ __ ] anyway


---------69:04----------
just break up with me and be done with


---------69:05----------
it


---------69:06----------
[Music]


---------69:07----------
and it's like hearing him just like


---------69:12----------
it's it sucks to hear it but it's true


---------69:16----------
like that's pretty much


---------69:18----------
what i'll say like for lack of a better


---------69:20----------
job it's pretty much almost exactly


---------69:22----------
verbatim how i how i act yeah and it's


---------69:25----------
like it's very embarrassing sharing this


---------69:27----------
because this is definitely one of those


---------69:29----------
things that i feel the most shame about


---------69:30----------
i can share other stuff like i can show


---------69:32----------
my loose skin


---------69:33----------
and like all this stuff that people are


---------69:34----------
like oh that like i've had people call


---------69:36----------
it like people will say oh your skin's


---------69:37----------
disgusting


---------69:38----------
that's so nasty and i'm like whatever i


---------69:40----------
don't care like this thing i'm just like


---------69:43----------
oh it's just like it's like definitely


---------69:45----------
something i feel them like


---------69:47----------
i don't want to say the most shame of


---------69:48----------
because i don't know but like i feel a


---------69:49----------
lot of shame


---------69:51----------
yeah so john how do you feel sharing


---------69:52----------
this now like what are you feeling in


---------69:54----------
this moment this is


---------69:55----------
we can work through this okay i'm


---------69:58----------
feeling well


---------69:59----------
the immediate reaction is i'm feeling


---------70:01----------
relief um


---------70:02----------
because i it makes


---------70:06----------
me feel like i i have to act less like i


---------70:10----------
am


---------70:10----------
like perfect you know because like i


---------70:13----------
think something i struggle with is


---------70:15----------
i think and this is like the whole


---------70:17----------
imposter thing is like there are so many


---------70:18----------
people that follow me and i


---------70:19----------
want to be good for them i want to be


---------70:21----------
perfect and like i've explained


---------70:23----------
um this before and like i feel like


---------70:26----------
there's a lot of times where i wear a


---------70:27----------
mask


---------70:28----------
and then a lot of times people don't


---------70:30----------
even like the mask that i'm wearing


---------70:32----------
so the the thing that i put on to make


---------70:34----------
people like me people don't even like


---------70:35----------
anyways


---------70:36----------
so now i feel like i'm kind of like


---------70:38----------
floating


---------70:39----------
in this like just like i'm just like


---------70:41----------
what


---------70:42----------
am i you know yeah i can't win um but i


---------70:46----------
definitely i


---------70:47----------
i just like full transparency i feel


---------70:49----------
relieved


---------70:50----------
but also i feel worried that people are


---------70:52----------
gonna move


---------70:54----------
that people are gonna what the heck are


---------70:56----------
gonna feel just like


---------70:57----------
are you kidding me man like jeez you


---------70:59----------
really have some stuff to work on and


---------71:01----------
that


---------71:01----------
that scares me because i think that um


---------71:04----------
i i i that mask is still on to a certain


---------71:07----------
extent like i want to be the


---------71:09----------
i know what i'm doing and i can help


---------71:12----------
everyone you know


---------71:13----------
yeah so it sounds like you're afraid of


---------71:14----------
judgment yeah oh yeah yeah


---------71:18----------
yeah so i i think interestingly enough i


---------71:21----------
think that that fear of judgment comes


---------71:22----------
from you


---------71:23----------
right because you judge it yeah


---------71:27----------
and and it's because if we really pay


---------71:28----------
attention john we can see that other


---------71:30----------
people can judge you and even judge you


---------71:32----------
harshly


---------71:33----------
but it doesn't stick unless you judge


---------71:35----------
yourself in the same way


---------71:37----------
yeah right you feeling okay your voice


---------71:40----------
has changed


---------71:42----------
oh no no i i fully agree sorry okay


---------71:45----------
no no i i'm just it's not anything


---------71:48----------
you're doing wrong


---------71:48----------
yeah no i'm not i'm not choked up yet


---------71:51----------
okay that's cool


---------71:52----------
i mean we don't it's our goal is not to


---------71:54----------
choke you up i think this is often time


---------71:56----------
it's a common misconception um yeah


---------71:59----------
so let's just talk about pushing people


---------72:01----------
away for a second because i want to i


---------72:03----------
want to try to help you understand that


---------72:04----------
or at least my understanding of it


---------72:06----------
so it's interesting right because when


---------72:07----------
you push your girlfriend away and she


---------72:09----------
doesn't


---------72:10----------
break up with you how do you feel


---------72:14----------
like what's wrong with you um


---------72:17----------
but it definitely like joking that's


---------72:20----------
kind of sometimes how i feel


---------72:22----------
um because i'm always thinking like what


---------72:26----------
are you trying to get


---------72:27----------
out of this like why why are you


---------72:28----------
sticking around i think i struggle with


---------72:30----------
that just in general like with other


---------72:32----------
people


---------72:33----------
um reaching out and being like oh you


---------72:34----------
should like watch this video or do this


---------72:37----------
like i made this you should you should


---------72:38----------
check it out


---------72:39----------
i deal with that a lot and so i'm always


---------72:41----------
kind of constantly on guard of people


---------72:43----------
feeling like people only want to be


---------72:45----------
around me because they can get something


---------72:46----------
out of that


---------72:48----------
um but then on top of that i do feel


---------72:51----------
this sense of um security and feeling


---------72:55----------
like okay well


---------72:56----------
she obviously definitely does care right


---------72:59----------
because


---------73:00----------
holy crap if she didn't why would she


---------73:01----------
stick around this


---------73:03----------
um yeah so so so that's


---------73:06----------
i'm glad you can detect that because


---------73:08----------
that's really an


---------73:09----------
important thing and i'm glad you see it


---------73:11----------
and know that already so john you're


---------73:12----------
very insightful it's i think it's


---------73:15----------
it's cool because i think we can cover a


---------73:17----------
lot of ground


---------73:18----------
so i think so if we i want people to


---------73:20----------
understand this too who are watching so


---------73:21----------
part of the reason that we push people


---------73:23----------
away


---------73:24----------
is so that we can feel secure when


---------73:27----------
they don't leave right so if i if i'm


---------73:31----------
afraid of my value


---------73:32----------
and i say john get the [ __ ] out of here


---------73:35----------
and then despite all of my efforts to


---------73:38----------
push you away


---------73:40----------
if you choose to stay then i do feel


---------73:43----------
secure


---------73:44----------
yeah so it's really tricky because like


---------73:47----------
the harder you push her and the worse


---------73:49----------
you feel about herself


---------73:51----------
conversely the more secure you're gonna


---------73:54----------
feel


---------73:55----------
even in sort of like a weird convoluted


---------73:57----------
toxic


---------73:58----------
way because like it's like


---------74:02----------
it's like you're challenging her to


---------74:05----------
demonstrate her commitment to you


---------74:07----------
yeah yeah and it can be very damaging


---------74:10----------
for relationships don't get me wrong but


---------74:12----------
i i think part of what we have to


---------74:14----------
understand is that i think like john


---------74:16----------
most people in our mind just works like


---------74:18----------
this like it does what it needs to


---------74:21----------
to get what it needs and it sort of does


---------74:23----------
the best that it can


---------74:25----------
it's on this in a bizarre way like part


---------74:27----------
of you pushing her away


---------74:29----------
is like a way of you actually reassuring


---------74:32----------
yourself


---------74:34----------
that the things that you believe about


---------74:37----------
yourself


---------74:37----------
may not be true that makes


---------74:41----------
that completely makes sense right and so


---------74:44----------
so the the next question is okay so like


---------74:46----------
what do we do about it and i i think the


---------74:48----------
first step is just that to like notice


---------74:50----------
that you're doing this


---------74:52----------
right to watch because now you're saying


---------74:54----------
that you don't feel like you're in


---------74:56----------
control


---------74:57----------
and now we kind of get to an interesting


---------74:59----------
kind of like yogic part which is that


---------75:00----------
you have


---------75:01----------
two parts you have three parts of being


---------75:04----------
you have a physical body


---------75:06----------
you have a mental body or a mind


---------75:09----------
and then you have something like


---------75:12----------
awareness


---------75:12----------
or a soul like those terms are sort of


---------75:16----------
interchangeably


---------75:18----------
what i mean by soul is you can talk


---------75:20----------
about soul is something that persists


---------75:22----------
beyond body and mind be


---------75:24----------
after death and all that stuff but the


---------75:26----------
point here is that


---------75:27----------
even if you don't believe in any of that


---------75:28----------
you don't need to what you can still


---------75:30----------
acknowledge is that there is some part


---------75:32----------
of awareness


---------75:33----------
or self that exists outside of body and


---------75:36----------
mind


---------75:37----------
like if i can observe my hand then i can


---------75:40----------
then


---------75:40----------
i'm not my hand right like this is not


---------75:42----------
who i am


---------75:43----------
i am something outside of this and then


---------75:45----------
what we hear you say is that sometimes


---------75:47----------
you are not your mind and that something


---------75:49----------
takes control


---------75:50----------
of your mind but then that still means


---------75:53----------
that you are not your mind


---------75:56----------
and and so the the key thing in terms of


---------75:59----------
like


---------76:00----------
making progress here is to focus on that


---------76:03----------
thing


---------76:03----------
and to even watch your mind get taken


---------76:06----------
over


---------76:07----------
by this thing and it's almost like you


---------76:10----------
start a movie and like the movie's gotta


---------76:12----------
play through to the end


---------76:14----------
you know you're like boarding a train


---------76:16----------
and you don't get to go off halfway


---------76:18----------
the train only goes from point a to


---------76:20----------
point b and so once you start to feel


---------76:22----------
that vulnerability the first thing you


---------76:24----------
should do is just like


---------76:25----------
watch it run its course that you're


---------76:28----------
gonna try to push her away and she's


---------76:30----------
gonna reassure you


---------76:31----------
and when she reassures you there are


---------76:33----------
going to be two things in your mind one


---------76:35----------
is like what on earth are you thinking i


---------76:36----------
don't understand why you're trying to


---------76:37----------
reassure me because i'm not worth it


---------76:40----------
and just watch that and then the second


---------76:42----------
thing is like deep down you're actually


---------76:44----------
going to start to feel


---------76:45----------
secure and comforted because


---------76:49----------
you don't feel like you're worth


---------76:50----------
something and when she treats you


---------76:52----------
with affection in spite of you not


---------76:55----------
deserving it


---------76:56----------
that can be really reassuring


---------77:00----------
so then that begs the question and let


---------77:02----------
me know if you have further questions


---------77:03----------
okay because i'm kind of in teaching


---------77:04----------
mode now


---------77:06----------
so then that begs the question why on


---------77:07----------
earth does this continue to happen


---------77:09----------
if we feel secure like you'd think that


---------77:12----------
if she feels if she makes you feel


---------77:14----------
secure


---------77:15----------
shouldn't it go away and the problem


---------77:19----------
here is that even though it makes you


---------77:20----------
feel


---------77:21----------
secure it still reinforces


---------77:25----------
the idea that you don't deserve her


---------77:27----------
affection


---------77:29----------
and that's at the root of all of it does


---------77:31----------
that make sense


---------77:32----------
yeah and so each time it happens


---------77:36----------
even though you feel better because she


---------77:38----------
makes you feel loved in spite of it


---------77:40----------
in spite of the fact that you don't


---------77:41----------
deserve her love because that can


---------77:42----------
actually feel really amazing right that


---------77:44----------
someone loves you and you don't even


---------77:45----------
deserve it


---------77:46----------
and so that's why you do it but the


---------77:48----------
other really


---------77:49----------
careful thing is that you're building up


---------77:51----------
that machine that believes that you


---------77:53----------
don't deserve love


---------77:55----------
and this circles all the way back to


---------77:57----------
this idea that you're lucky and you're


---------77:58----------
grateful and whatever


---------78:00----------
and if you just go back and you listen


---------78:02----------
to everything that you're saying john


---------78:04----------
ask yourself how many of these


---------78:06----------
statements thoughts or feelings


---------78:09----------
come from the idea that you don't


---------78:11----------
deserve it


---------78:12----------
that you're not good enough right


---------78:16----------
you you post something about your typing


---------78:18----------
or whatever and then people are like


---------78:22----------
yeah why are you so bad bro okay like


---------78:24----------
why does that hurt because you don't


---------78:26----------
feel


---------78:26----------
like you're you have value on the inside


---------78:31----------
and and all this stuff around your


---------78:32----------
girlfriend and like all the stuff about


---------78:34----------
you know it all comes back to value


---------78:37----------
[Music]


---------78:39----------
thoughts questions about that no i mean


---------78:42----------
at all


---------78:43----------
it all makes sense like i think that


---------78:47----------
a lot of it definitely comes down to


---------78:49----------
feeling


---------78:50----------
like i said like feeling like worthless


---------78:52----------
or feeling like you don't you don't


---------78:54----------
deserve


---------78:55----------
like that's a big part of it is like i


---------78:57----------
don't feel like i deserve


---------78:58----------
anything really you know and like i i


---------79:01----------
think it like started from a good spot


---------79:03----------
of like


---------79:04----------
trying to not be selfish and like trying


---------79:06----------
to not be like i you like


---------79:08----------
i deserve the world like i don't want to


---------79:09----------
be that person you know


---------79:11----------
i want to be grateful and thankful but i


---------79:13----------
mean it goes back to almost like the


---------79:14----------
very beginning of the talk


---------79:15----------
we were talking about that can be


---------79:16----------
dangerous because then it's like well if


---------79:18----------
you don't deserve anything then what are


---------79:20----------
you


---------79:20----------
are you like and that's where my mind


---------79:22----------
goes yep


---------79:24----------
and so i think it's it's a tricky


---------79:25----------
balance right so how do you


---------79:31----------
ha so so i think it comes down to kind


---------79:33----------
of acceptance of of where you are


---------79:35----------
and like how can you be grateful for the


---------79:37----------
things that you


---------79:38----------
deserve right because we think about


---------79:40----------
like gratitude


---------79:42----------
and deserving is like entitlement at


---------79:44----------
opposite ends of the spectrum but


---------79:45----------
it's actually really simple right like


---------79:47----------
if i um if i go to a restaurant and i


---------79:50----------
order food


---------79:51----------
i deserve that food and yet i can still


---------79:54----------
be really grateful that it tastes


---------79:55----------
amazing


---------79:57----------
yeah right and and so and i can also be


---------80:01----------
upset because you know i paid for like


---------80:03----------
good food and you guys are giving me


---------80:04----------
like microwave [ __ ] from yesterday


---------80:07----------
yeah i'm allowed to be upset at that and


---------80:09----------
also like not be an [ __ ]


---------80:12----------
i can acknowledge that i actually


---------80:13----------
deserve more than what i got


---------80:16----------
and then the cool thing is that and now


---------80:18----------
we get to a really tricky thing john


---------80:20----------
is that i don't know if you can forgive


---------80:22----------
anyone


---------80:25----------
if they didn't do anything wrong


---------80:28----------
and if you didn't deserve anything then


---------80:30----------
no one


---------80:32----------
did anything wrong to you right


---------80:36----------
and so the really tricky thing here is


---------80:37----------
that i i don't think you're living a


---------80:39----------
life


---------80:39----------
where you can actually like like i don't


---------80:42----------
know if you've forgiven your mom


---------80:45----------
yeah you know it's in it and we haven't


---------80:47----------
really talked about it and you said that


---------80:49----------
like


---------80:49----------
you know she got her life together and


---------80:51----------
like sure there's a whole story of


---------80:53----------
success and acceptance and


---------80:54----------
transformation and growth which is


---------80:56----------
really really positive


---------80:58----------
and there's also a story of like having


---------81:01----------
a child and like


---------81:02----------
going through foster care and and a lot


---------81:04----------
of uncertainty a lot of terror


---------81:07----------
right frankly i can only imagine what it


---------81:09----------
would be like for a three-year-old to


---------81:10----------
like


---------81:11----------
you know move to some uncle's house and


---------81:13----------
then like


---------81:14----------
you talk about being grateful because


---------81:15----------
you didn't go into the system you can


---------81:17----------
express gratitude


---------81:18----------
for your uncle and you can also


---------81:22----------
be mad at your mom for like bringing you


---------81:24----------
into a world where


---------81:26----------
she really didn't take care of you for


---------81:28----------
the first couple of years


---------81:31----------
and i'm not saying that you should call


---------81:33----------
her a bad person but like


---------81:35----------
you know i think it's important if


---------81:36----------
someone kind of doesn't do their job


---------81:40----------
and doesn't do right by their children


---------81:42----------
for the child to be able to forgive


---------81:46----------
because i think that there's there's a


---------81:48----------
lot of negative emotion there and i find


---------81:49----------
it hard to believe that on some level


---------81:51----------
like you don't hold some of that


---------81:54----------
um


---------81:57----------
yeah i think like hearing that i just i


---------82:01----------
struggle with it because i know my mom


---------82:03----------
has also beat herself up a lot because


---------82:06----------
of


---------82:07----------
um because of it and i know like we


---------82:10----------
we've had conversations where


---------82:12----------
she like a lot of she she blames herself


---------82:16----------
a lot for


---------82:17----------
like how large i was as well as a child


---------82:19----------
because


---------82:20----------
uh we couldn't really afford any like


---------82:23----------
like presents and stuff like that but


---------82:24----------
like whenever we did have extra money it


---------82:26----------
went to like buying fast food or buying


---------82:28----------
like a


---------82:28----------
as a treat right because we could


---------82:30----------
actually that was like something we


---------82:31----------
could afford


---------82:33----------
and i know that she holds a lot of a lot


---------82:36----------
of guilt for


---------82:37----------
the size that i was and like she's she's


---------82:38----------
told me a story like she used to walk


---------82:40----------
into my room when i was at my heaviest


---------82:41----------
and


---------82:42----------
like when i was sleeping and she'd look


---------82:43----------
at the bed and she would like she


---------82:45----------
describes like it was just a big blob on


---------82:46----------
the bed because of how large i was


---------82:48----------
and she would leave the room crying you


---------82:50----------
know and so i like i


---------82:52----------
i feel a lot of um i feel a lot of


---------82:56----------
pride in the fact that i've been able to


---------82:58----------
take that away from her


---------83:00----------
um take that guilt away because now i'm


---------83:02----------
good you know like you don't


---------83:04----------
worry about it let me explain something


---------83:05----------
to you okay dude this is important but


---------83:07----------
stay with me


---------83:08----------
you haven't taken it away from her she


---------83:10----------
still carries that [ __ ] man


---------83:13----------
[Music]


---------83:14----------
let me ask you something if i do


---------83:15----------
something wrong to you


---------83:18----------
and i feel guilty


---------83:21----------
how do you make me feel better


---------83:30----------
i mean i guess like by maybe saying


---------83:33----------
sorry and like not doing it again


---------83:36----------
no no so so if i wrong you and i feel


---------83:39----------
guilty


---------83:39----------
how do you make me feel better sorry


---------83:45----------
i [ __ ] by saying it's all good like i'm


---------83:47----------
i'm


---------83:48----------
it's okay like i'll be fine ah


---------83:51----------
so that's what you say so i think that's


---------83:53----------
the interesting thing right


---------83:54----------
so the way i say that a lot i'll be fine


---------83:57----------
yep


---------83:58----------
so so i don't think that's what it is


---------84:00----------
it's it's for you to say i forgive you


---------84:04----------
it's a to acknowledge that you [ __ ] up


---------84:07----------
we're gonna own that together


---------84:09----------
and i forgive you anyway but i think the


---------84:12----------
problem here is that when you say


---------84:14----------
it's all good like it's subtle it's very


---------84:17----------
very subtle


---------84:19----------
the person who can get rid of her guilt


---------84:22----------
is actually you but in order to get rid


---------84:24----------
of her guilt you have to acknowledge


---------84:26----------
what she did wrong


---------84:28----------
and then forgive her for it yeah i


---------84:31----------
i definitely try and i try and make


---------84:34----------
people not feel bad


---------84:35----------
and so instead of being like you know


---------84:37----------
that was really messed up i'm like it's


---------84:38----------
all good i'm fine


---------84:40----------
you know don't worry about it that's i


---------84:42----------
say that all the time like to my


---------84:43----------
girlfriend as well


---------84:44----------
like don't worry about it yep which


---------84:46----------
doesn't i guess


---------84:47----------
leaves no one with any sort of recourse


---------84:49----------
i guess because there you go


---------84:51----------
right it's weird it's one of these


---------84:53----------
adaptations that we have to maintain


---------84:55----------
harmony but doesn't fix the problem


---------84:59----------
and i just think about this for a second


---------85:01----------
if you go to your mom and like it's


---------85:02----------
gonna hurt


---------85:03----------
right and you say like when you saw me


---------85:06----------
as a blob


---------85:06----------
like there are times in my life where i


---------85:09----------
wish


---------85:10----------
that you hadn't given us fast food


---------85:13----------
but the more that i've come to


---------85:15----------
understand you and


---------85:17----------
and things like that i understand that


---------85:18----------
you didn't know any better and i forgive


---------85:20----------
you for that


---------85:22----------
and i also think that it's amazing that


---------85:24----------
you got clean like


---------85:25----------
do i wish the first couple of my years


---------85:27----------
of my life were different


---------85:29----------
yes could you have done a better job


---------85:33----------
absolutely and i forgive you anyway


---------85:35----------
because at the end of the day you did


---------85:36----------
get your [ __ ] together


---------85:38----------
and you supported me in ways a b and c


---------85:41----------
and i'm not overweight now i'm doing


---------85:44----------
awesome in life and part of that is


---------85:45----------
because of what you've given me


---------85:49----------
and so i forgive you for what happened


---------85:51----------
because at the end of the day my life is


---------85:53----------
pretty good


---------85:54----------
now and you did get sober right so it's


---------85:58----------
it's like


---------85:59----------
john for you i mean you're so insightful


---------86:02----------
and you're so introspective


---------86:04----------
for you this next phase is about balance


---------86:06----------
of the good and the bad


---------86:08----------
it's not good versus bad it's not


---------86:09----------
protecting your mom from the hurt


---------86:11----------
because you don't want to hurt her


---------86:13----------
you have to let her be hurt and then you


---------86:15----------
have to let her heal


---------86:16----------
but because you're taking that away from


---------86:18----------
her you're never holding her responsible


---------86:21----------
you can't ever forgive her and she can't


---------86:22----------
ever move past it


---------86:25----------
instead you guys just kind of pretend


---------86:27----------
you know no harm no foul


---------86:30----------
yeah which there's a part of me that


---------86:33----------
says that like


---------86:34----------
for her to truly be at peace you've got


---------86:36----------
to let her own her mistakes


---------86:39----------
but make sure she doesn't fall into the


---------86:41----------
trap of devaluing her successes too


---------86:44----------
you've got to give her both the good and


---------86:46----------
the bad


---------86:48----------
and then if you say mom i forgive you i


---------86:49----------
think then her guilt will really go away


---------86:52----------
because right now it's just buried yeah


---------86:56----------
thoughts i mean i i


---------86:59----------
i think that you are you are definitely


---------87:02----------
right i


---------87:02----------
um i think like this is something that a


---------87:05----------
lot of my family has done


---------87:07----------
um i would say more most specifically


---------87:10----------
probably my


---------87:11----------
my brother and me my brother he's older


---------87:14----------
than i am


---------87:15----------
and uh he is also you know doing his own


---------87:17----------
thing he just got married they're about


---------87:19----------
to have a baby soon and like he's gotten


---------87:20----------
out of that kind of world


---------87:22----------
um and so we both kind of try and just


---------87:25----------
be like every hey we're good


---------87:27----------
my mom everything's fine but a lot of my


---------87:29----------
uh


---------87:30----------
some parts of my family haven't really


---------87:33----------
gotten out of it and


---------87:34----------
they struggle with the same things my


---------87:36----------
mom did um


---------87:38----------
and so i think part of why i it's so


---------87:40----------
hard for me to do that to my mom is


---------87:42----------
because i know that she's still


---------87:43----------
struggling with so much guilt with like


---------87:44----------
my oldest brother travis


---------87:46----------
is still a he's still a drug addict and


---------87:49----------
like he's


---------87:50----------
getting arrested all the time still and


---------87:52----------
he's almost he's 40 years old


---------87:54----------
and my mom i know my mom carries a lot


---------87:56----------
of guilt


---------87:57----------
with with him still about him still


---------88:00----------
um and then with my younger sister she


---------88:02----------
is


---------88:04----------
he's getting on the right foot but she's


---------88:05----------
had a lot of struggles as well


---------88:07----------
and um my mom basically takes care of


---------88:09----------
her child


---------88:10----------
um my niece faith who i love a lot um


---------88:12----------
but i know that


---------88:14----------
she carries a lot of guilt because of


---------88:15----------
that so i just feel bad like stacking


---------88:18----------
you know like i just like hey i'm doing


---------88:21----------
good mom like you


---------88:22----------
you i know that you have to worry about


---------88:24----------
them don't worry about me


---------88:26----------
i'm cool like everything's you know i'm


---------88:28----------
doing i'm doing well which obviously


---------88:30----------
isn't


---------88:31----------
true but it's like that's i guess what i


---------88:32----------
tell myself yeah so so i think it's it's


---------88:35----------
makes sense right because you're


---------88:36----------
protecting her yeah


---------88:39----------
like you said you don't want to stack


---------88:40----------
guilt and so i'm not saying that the


---------88:42----------
conversation needs to happen now


---------88:44----------
yeah but i do think for real healing


---------88:48----------
and and you know this reminds me of of


---------88:51----------
you know sometimes i hear


---------88:54----------
some people say that you know your mom


---------88:56----------
did the best that she could i hear this


---------88:58----------
a lot


---------88:59----------
from from children who are protective of


---------89:01----------
their parents


---------89:02----------
yeah and they said you know she did the


---------89:04----------
best that she could


---------89:06----------
you don't say she did a great job she


---------89:08----------
said


---------89:09----------
she did the best that she could there's


---------89:10----------
a big difference there


---------89:13----------
and i i i'm telling you i've i've seen


---------89:15----------
this play out a couple of times where


---------89:17----------
like in the right time in the right


---------89:19----------
place


---------89:22----------
um you know you can have a conversation


---------89:24----------
with her


---------89:25----------
and then the other thing is that


---------89:26----------
sometimes you don't even need a


---------89:27----------
conversation with her


---------89:29----------
you just need to like process that for


---------89:31----------
yourself


---------89:33----------
and then she'll feel because right now


---------89:36----------
what she gets from you


---------89:37----------
is like she [ __ ] knows man she's your


---------89:40----------
mom


---------89:41----------
she knows that there's a wall that


---------89:42----------
you're putting up and you're trying to


---------89:44----------
protect her


---------89:44----------
and she loves you for it but she's your


---------89:47----------
mom and she knows that on the other side


---------89:49----------
of that wall is hurt


---------89:53----------
and even if you can forgive her yourself


---------89:55----------
you don't have to say anything to her


---------89:57----------
but if you can forgive her and you can


---------89:59----------
stop protecting her and you can let


---------90:00----------
those walls down she's gonna know that


---------90:02----------
too and i've seen that


---------90:04----------
when you know we'll work through things


---------90:06----------
in therapy with patients where like


---------90:07----------
people will let go of resentment towards


---------90:08----------
their parents and like their parents


---------90:10----------
like


---------90:11----------
it's weird like they'll meet for


---------90:12----------
christmas and their parents will like


---------90:13----------
start crying and [ __ ] and like no one


---------90:14----------
knows what's going on


---------90:16----------
but like they can tell yeah i mean


---------90:19----------
yeah i think like if even if you don't


---------90:21----------
want to just say it's like through


---------90:22----------
wavelengths but like


---------90:23----------
it definitely could be through how i


---------90:25----------
would act because i definitely don't i


---------90:26----------
don't reach out to her very much i don't


---------90:28----------
share much with her because again it's


---------90:30----------
like i'm just trying to like


---------90:34----------
i guess like i don't want to say wash my


---------90:36----------
hands of it but just i just like hey


---------90:38----------
you're doing your thing i'm doing my


---------90:39----------
thing there's no re like i love you


---------90:40----------
there's no reason for us to


---------90:42----------
talk too much you know i don't we don't


---------90:43----------
really don't talk very much at all


---------90:45----------
how do you feel about that


---------90:49----------
it's it's definitely something that i


---------90:53----------
i didn't think that it would happen


---------90:55----------
because i lived with her up until i was


---------90:56----------
like 23 or 24


---------90:59----------
um and so i lived with her so we talked


---------91:03----------
all the time but then once i left it was


---------91:04----------
like almost


---------91:06----------
because that that house that i was


---------91:08----------
living in was very crazy


---------91:09----------
like my sister lived there with my niece


---------91:11----------
and it was her and then we at one point


---------91:13----------
we had 10 people living there with one


---------91:14----------
bathroom like it was just crazy


---------91:16----------
and i remember like leaving there i felt


---------91:18----------
like i was leaving everything behind


---------91:21----------
and i kind of treated it that way um


---------91:23----------
like i just kind of stopped reaching out


---------91:26----------
and uh and i kind of just like


---------91:29----------
i i just wait for her to reach out to me


---------91:33----------
i think like not because i don't care


---------91:35----------
about her but because like


---------91:38----------
one thing i also like really struggle


---------91:40----------
with is feeling like i'm a burden


---------91:41----------
and i don't want to feel like i'm being


---------91:42----------
a burden by like hey i have this or like


---------91:45----------
i want i need this help or i just wanted


---------91:46----------
to reach out and say hi like even though


---------91:48----------
that's silly like why would i be a


---------91:49----------
burden by just saying hi


---------91:51----------
like that's how i feel and so i just


---------91:53----------
don't you know


---------91:54----------
okay so now we're getting into different


---------91:57----------
territory


---------91:58----------
so so you know where does that feeling


---------92:00----------
come from because that's an echo too


---------92:02----------
oh the the burden thing is oh man


---------92:06----------
i i think it comes from similar places


---------92:09----------
of like the feeling stupid um because of


---------92:12----------
the extra help i would get i felt like i


---------92:15----------
was becoming a burden to other people


---------92:17----------
and then like this is like it's it's a


---------92:19----------
lot of


---------92:20----------
like when i say like i'm worthless and


---------92:22----------
all this stuff then i'm also tacking on


---------92:24----------
like you're you're being a burden like


---------92:25----------
you're making things harder for other


---------92:27----------
people


---------92:28----------
so this is why i think like i've even


---------92:30----------
had conversations with people that help


---------92:32----------
me like with some of my


---------92:33----------
my mods and my discord and like all this


---------92:35----------
stuff is like i don't i almost never ask


---------92:37----------
them for help


---------92:38----------
and they're like dude you're weird we


---------92:41----------
want to help you and i'm just like


---------92:43----------
no i'll do it myself like i just do it


---------92:45----------
myself it's fine like i i


---------92:46----------
am used to doing everything on my own


---------92:49----------
and


---------92:50----------
i think it's because i don't like to i


---------92:52----------
just don't want people to feel like they


---------92:54----------
need to help me like i want to be able


---------92:55----------
to


---------92:56----------
i can do on my own i don't need anyone


---------92:58----------
to help me


---------92:59----------
because i feel like if i'm being a


---------93:00----------
burden that's like a negative thing


---------93:02----------
and then like i'm a burden because i am


---------93:04----------
stupid and because


---------93:05----------
i am i i can't do things on my own


---------93:08----------
and i just i i really really don't like


---------93:11----------
feeling that way because like i want to


---------93:13----------
help others


---------93:14----------
i don't want others to have to help me i


---------93:16----------
guess


---------93:17----------
um right so i don't want others


---------93:20----------
so so that's interesting because there's


---------93:22----------
a i


---------93:24----------
you tossed in one very interesting word


---------93:26----------
there


---------93:27----------
i want to help others i don't want


---------93:29----------
others to have to help me


---------93:31----------
yeah right yeah that i don't want like


---------93:35----------
it's a necessity when they're helping


---------93:37----------
you because you can't do it without them


---------93:40----------
and and i think there's something


---------93:42----------
significant i don't know exactly


---------93:43----------
what that is it's going to take me some


---------93:45----------
time to process that but


---------93:47----------
the other thing so john i would say you


---------93:49----------
know i'm going to give you some advice


---------93:51----------
or ask you to do something which is


---------93:53----------
something i very rarely do


---------93:55----------
i think you should talk to your mom more


---------93:57----------
yeah


---------93:58----------
yeah i agree okay and and here's why


---------94:02----------
so it sounds like your sister is still


---------94:03----------
kind of struggling your brother is


---------94:05----------
still kind of struggling and you don't


---------94:06----------
want to help her


---------94:08----------
i think you should give your mom a


---------94:11----------
wonderful opportunity that your brother


---------94:12----------
and sister can't help


---------94:14----------
can't give her which is the opportunity


---------94:16----------
to help one of her children


---------94:18----------
and it actually end up well


---------94:22----------
right yeah you should give her the


---------94:25----------
chance to help you


---------94:27----------
and this is the thing she doesn't need


---------94:29----------
to help you you don't have to have it


---------94:30----------
happen


---------94:30----------
so we're gonna dispel all of that give


---------94:33----------
her the opportunity


---------94:35----------
if you need some support let her support


---------94:38----------
you


---------94:38----------
and you know in the back your mind if


---------94:40----------
she can't do it no big deal you're gonna


---------94:42----------
be fine anyway


---------94:44----------
but give her the chance if you're


---------94:46----------
worried about something or you have like


---------94:47----------
a fight with your girlfriend or whatever


---------94:49----------
like


---------94:49----------
you know if you really want to push your


---------94:51----------
girlfriend away talk to your mom about


---------94:52----------
it


---------94:55----------
um right but i would say just talk to


---------94:59----------
her man


---------95:00----------
yeah and even even feeling like i i


---------95:02----------
can't tell you


---------95:03----------
do you have kids john no okay


---------95:06----------
so i can tell you as a dad like kids


---------95:08----------
burdening you is like only annoying some


---------95:10----------
of the time


---------95:12----------
but generally speaking you know as a


---------95:13----------
parent like i love to know what's going


---------95:15----------
on in my kid's life i love to be able to


---------95:17----------
help that's what i'm [ __ ] here for


---------95:19----------
and for your mom you've got to give her


---------95:21----------
the chance to make up for lost time


---------95:25----------
because right now in her mind i can


---------95:27----------
guarantee you that she feels that


---------95:29----------
there's a pile of [ __ ] that she should


---------95:30----------
have done for you that she didn't do


---------95:33----------
yeah and you feel like you're a burden


---------95:35----------
but what you're you're really doing is


---------95:37----------
preventing her


---------95:38----------
from like paying off that debt you know


---------95:42----------
so give her the opportunity to help you


---------95:44----------
give her the opportunity to be a part of


---------95:46----------
your life and let her see that you're


---------95:49----------
okay


---------95:52----------
and let her see that you're not okay


---------95:55----------
and if you need her help like that's


---------95:57----------
totally cool man like


---------95:58----------
take her help because that's what moms


---------96:00----------
are here for


---------96:02----------
[Music]


---------96:03----------
what do you think about that


---------96:06----------
i mean i think that i mean it's


---------96:10----------
it's definitely something that i


---------96:13----------
i think will be helpful i know i would


---------96:15----------
the first thing i wanted to say is that


---------96:16----------
i need to do but


---------96:18----------
i just i didn't feel like i wanted to


---------96:19----------
use that those words but i do believe


---------96:21----------
that it is


---------96:23----------
um something that will not just be


---------96:24----------
helpful to me but i i know will be


---------96:26----------
helpful to her


---------96:27----------
and even if it's like like yeah like you


---------96:31----------
said like just being like hey mom i


---------96:34----------
this happened today i'm just stressed


---------96:35----------
about it what do you think you know and


---------96:36----------
like just like even like


---------96:38----------
even though it might seem insignificant


---------96:39----------
to me the thought that she could like


---------96:41----------
help me


---------96:42----------
talk me through it or just kind of share


---------96:43----------
her thoughts um


---------96:45----------
i know that she would she would


---------96:46----------
appreciate that opportunity


---------96:48----------
so i agree yeah right and and you know


---------96:52----------
let her because i i think if we really


---------96:55----------
think about like


---------96:56----------
if we really think about where this echo


---------96:58----------
comes from right so i i


---------96:59----------
what it is in sanskrit it's called the


---------97:01----------
sum scott so some scott is like a ball


---------97:04----------
of undigested


---------97:05----------
emotion or like a trauma what we're


---------97:08----------
really talking about is like when we


---------97:09----------
think about and


---------97:10----------
and this may sound you know


---------97:13----------
be careful about i've been hesitating to


---------97:15----------
say this but i'm just gonna go and say


---------97:16----------
it


---------97:17----------
so if we think about really where


---------97:18----------
insecurity comes from there's this


---------97:19----------
branch of psychology called attachment


---------97:21----------
theory


---------97:23----------
an attachment theory has to do with the


---------97:25----------
security of the child


---------97:27----------
and how a child feels valued


---------97:30----------
and there are children who grow up with


---------97:32----------
something that we call insecure


---------97:33----------
attachment or children who grow up with


---------97:35----------
secure attachment


---------97:36----------
and the studies that are done on this


---------97:38----------
how you tell whether a child is secure


---------97:40----------
or has insecure or secure attachment


---------97:42----------
they do this really cool experiment


---------97:45----------
parent and child are in a room with some


---------97:47----------
blocks


---------97:49----------
and then stranger walks into the room


---------97:51----------
like they do this with like


---------97:52----------
one-year-olds okay


---------97:54----------
and then mom gets up and leaves the room


---------97:57----------
how long does it take for the child to


---------97:59----------
start crying


---------98:01----------
when the mom just like gets up and walks


---------98:03----------
away like how long before the child like


---------98:04----------
notices


---------98:05----------
becomes uncomfortable with with the the


---------98:07----------
other stranger in the room


---------98:09----------
and then the cool thing is for kids who


---------98:11----------
are securely attached when mom walks


---------98:12----------
back into the room


---------98:14----------
how long does it take for children to


---------98:16----------
stop crying


---------98:18----------
how long does it it take when they start


---------98:20----------
to feel insecure


---------98:22----------
when you start to feel worthless


---------98:25----------
how long does it take for other people


---------98:28----------
to be able to reassure you


---------98:31----------
and so for children who are securely


---------98:33----------
attached it takes like


---------98:34----------
less than 15 seconds they cry really


---------98:36----------
loud and like mom walks into the room


---------98:38----------
within a few seconds like the crying is


---------98:40----------
gone what i'm hearing from you and this


---------98:42----------
has to do with maybe like mind body kind


---------98:44----------
of stuff is like


---------98:45----------
i think if you grew up in a household in


---------98:47----------
the first three years of your life


---------98:49----------
with parents who were using you probably


---------98:52----------
your brain learned that the world is


---------98:54----------
like kind of a dangerous place


---------98:56----------
and it's hard to reassure children who


---------98:59----------
have insecure attachment


---------99:01----------
[Music]


---------99:02----------
and and so i what i'm hearing from you


---------99:05----------
is that it's hard to reassure you


---------99:07----------
right like when other people tell you


---------99:10----------
it's gonna be


---------99:11----------
okay i just don't believe him i just yep


---------99:14----------
i'm like yeah you're lying and the


---------99:17----------
really tricky thing


---------99:18----------
there is that like why is that it's


---------99:19----------
because like when you were one and


---------99:21----------
before you even had memories


---------99:24----------
when you were scared like it's sad to


---------99:27----------
say but like it probably wasn't okay


---------99:31----------
like it may have been something as


---------99:32----------
simple as like you know you needed a


---------99:33----------
diaper change or you were hungry or


---------99:35----------
something like that and like actually


---------99:37----------
your basic needs weren't met it's really


---------99:38----------
sad


---------99:40----------
i remember one time i was um when i was


---------99:42----------
doing my pediatrics rotation


---------99:44----------
we had this one kid on the floor who


---------99:46----------
looked really interesting so it's


---------99:47----------
interesting you talk about you know


---------99:48----------
extra skin


---------99:49----------
so it was like a really wrinkly baby


---------99:52----------
like super super wrinkly like flabs of


---------99:54----------
skin like hanging off they look like an


---------99:56----------
old person but like a baby turns out the


---------99:58----------
kid was very malnourished


---------100:01----------
and so they just had no baby fat and the


---------100:03----------
kid was just the sweetest kid in the


---------100:05----------
world because the kid never cried


---------100:08----------
all the other kids cry this kid doesn't


---------100:10----------
cry and i was like that's kind of


---------100:11----------
interesting like kids seem super chill


---------100:12----------
and one of the nurses


---------100:13----------
because nurses really understand [ __ ]


---------100:15----------
okay let me explain something to y'all


---------100:17----------
nurse was like the kid has learned that


---------100:19----------
crying is useless


---------100:21----------
oh that if it cries no one's gonna come


---------100:25----------
so when it feels bad it just sits with


---------100:27----------
itself


---------100:29----------
it doesn't reach out to other people


---------100:32----------
right and so if we really think about


---------100:35----------
like


---------100:36----------
what happened to you it's like my guess


---------100:38----------
is that it runs really deep my dude


---------100:42----------
and the good news i know that's dark but


---------100:45----------
the good news is that you don't have to


---------100:46----------
feel that way


---------100:48----------
right is that that can change and i


---------100:49----------
think that basically like give your mom


---------100:51----------
a chance to like


---------100:52----------
love you and take care of you


---------100:55----------
and the next time you feel like a child


---------100:57----------
go running to mama


---------100:59----------
and like just i'm curious like what


---------101:01----------
would happen i i'm really curious from a


---------101:02----------
diagnostic perspective


---------101:04----------
you can push your girlfriend away but i


---------101:05----------
wonder what would happen if you went


---------101:06----------
crying to mama like if she would


---------101:08----------
actually like like that's what you need


---------101:11----------
right and that's what she needs and then


---------101:12----------
she gets the chance to like fix what she


---------101:14----------
didn't do right in the first three years


---------101:16----------
of your life


---------101:22----------
anyway i've been talking a lot for like


---------101:25----------
the last half an hour to 45 minutes


---------101:30----------
no i i think like it's interesting that


---------101:33----------
you bring that up because i definitely


---------101:34----------
have this weird


---------101:35----------
like like my mom and my dad


---------101:38----------
they're both so appreciative when we


---------101:41----------
talk on the phone


---------101:42----------
because we don't really see each other


---------101:43----------
very much my dad lives kind of far away


---------101:45----------
like an hour


---------101:46----------
um and so whenever if we talk on the


---------101:49----------
phone like they're always like super


---------101:51----------
happy and it's weird because like i feel


---------101:53----------
good about that then i also almost feel


---------101:54----------
bad


---------101:55----------
that they like the simple act of just


---------101:57----------
talking on the phone like


---------101:58----------
brings them so much joy and like i am i


---------102:01----------
almost feel like i am withholding that


---------102:03----------
joy from them


---------102:04----------
in some way because i'm not interested


---------102:07----------
in really


---------102:07----------
talking that much like i think it might


---------102:09----------
be like you said like this


---------102:11----------
sense of i'm still blaming them for


---------102:13----------
things so i just kind of like


---------102:15----------
i'm just like good you guys do your


---------102:17----------
thing we'll do our thing


---------102:18----------
it's all good you know i'm fine uh


---------102:22----------
and so i definitely like i what you're


---------102:25----------
saying now i mean it definitely


---------102:26----------
resonates with me is i guess


---------102:27----------
what i'm trying to say yeah i mean so


---------102:29----------
john i'm gonna put different words to it


---------102:31----------
okay you let me know because these are


---------102:32----------
like kind of nasty words


---------102:34----------
i'm fine without you i don't need you


---------102:36----------
anymore


---------102:38----------
oh yeah yeah you weren't there when i


---------102:40----------
needed you and


---------102:41----------
i don't [ __ ] need you now yeah


---------102:46----------
right so that you've got to let go of


---------102:48----------
man that anger like


---------102:51----------
gotta let it go


---------102:54----------
and and you're not going to be able to


---------102:55----------
do that without forgiving him


---------102:58----------
yeah and so like to say that like i


---------103:01----------
needed you before you weren't there for


---------103:03----------
me


---------103:04----------
and i grew up anyway


---------103:07----------
and i hate you for that


---------103:11----------
but i also love you


---------103:14----------
because i recognize that like you had a


---------103:17----------
hard life too


---------103:21----------
and that like at some point you know you


---------103:23----------
did show up


---------103:24----------
and that without you i probably wouldn't


---------103:26----------
be where i am today


---------103:28----------
but boy did i wish you did a better job


---------103:30----------
because it caused me a lot of hurt


---------103:35----------
and you don't have to have that


---------103:36----------
conversation now


---------103:38----------
yeah like you can have it when you're


---------103:41----------
ready


---------103:43----------
but i'm not surprised that you know it's


---------103:45----------
hard for you to talk to them and you


---------103:46----------
kind of say it's all good now


---------103:48----------
because there's an undercurrent of like


---------103:49----------
anger and blame underneath that


---------103:53----------
yeah and then what we do is we we just


---------103:55----------
pile on all this positivity right like i


---------103:57----------
don't want to make him feel bad


---------103:58----------
because all those things are true it's


---------104:00----------
not that those things aren't true it's


---------104:01----------
just that


---------104:03----------
you know john you got rid of it yep


---------104:05----------
right it's not just


---------104:06----------
beast it's obese two beasts


---------104:10----------
yeah right it's like


---------104:13----------
triumph over adversity which means that


---------104:16----------
there was adversity


---------104:23----------
i started crying i


---------104:26----------
i took that one for the team thanks i


---------104:29----------
appreciate it yeah


---------104:32----------
is it is it cool if i go to the bathroom


---------104:33----------
real quick yeah absolutely i mean go for


---------104:35----------
it okay


---------104:35----------
all right i'll be right back i'm sorry


---------104:38----------
yeah so


---------104:39----------
you know john it actually feels to me


---------104:40----------
like we've kind of covered a fair amount


---------104:42----------
of ground and


---------104:43----------
and um you know if you have questions


---------104:45----------
and stuff i'd love


---------104:46----------
to answer them if you have thoughts that


---------104:48----------
you want to share i'd love to listen


---------104:50----------
um we can talk a little bit about


---------104:51----------
meditation if you'd like but


---------104:53----------
you know i kind of feel like we're at a


---------104:55----------
decent pause or stopping point how do


---------104:57----------
you feel


---------104:58----------
no yeah i think that that that sounds


---------105:00----------
good to me i just yeah i wanted to wait


---------105:02----------
to go to the bathroom until there was


---------105:03----------
like a


---------105:04----------
natural break in the conversation i


---------105:06----------
don't want to be like all right i gotta


---------105:07----------
go


---------105:08----------
um so i guess like one thing that i am


---------105:10----------
just interested this is a very


---------105:12----------
my own kind of personal thing so um


---------105:14----------
recently i've cut out


---------105:16----------
um caffeine for the most part like


---------105:18----------
because i felt like it was like really


---------105:20----------
triggering


---------105:20----------
uh my anxiety but i was just kind of


---------105:23----------
curious what you think about that is


---------105:24----------
that like kind of bs does that actually


---------105:26----------
help people


---------105:27----------
um is that actually a useful thing


---------105:29----------
because i definitely do miss caffeine


---------105:30----------
but


---------105:31----------
i feel like it i do feel like it's


---------105:32----------
helped me but i'm just like is that


---------105:34----------
placebo


---------105:35----------
um you know healthy like with


---------105:38----------
my anxiety because like i was i was i


---------105:40----------
felt like i was noticing


---------105:42----------
when i would um drink coffee in the


---------105:44----------
morning


---------105:45----------
was i would like feel those feelings of


---------105:48----------
anxiety a lot and like i would have like


---------105:51----------
um those little episodes that i was


---------105:52----------
telling you about maybe to a lesser


---------105:54----------
degree


---------105:55----------
um but i was just kind of curious like


---------105:57----------
what you think about that is


---------105:59----------
actually helpful yeah so i i think that


---------106:01----------
um it certainly is helpful


---------106:02----------
so the first thing to understand is that


---------106:05----------
you know human beings are different


---------106:06----------
and so you got to experiment and kind of


---------106:08----------
work to figure out what works for you


---------106:10----------
but there are some general principles so


---------106:12----------
if we think about caffeine caffeine is a


---------106:14----------
stimulant right and


---------106:16----------
anxiety is an issue of excess energy or


---------106:19----------
like the mind running really really fast


---------106:21----------
we think about if we talk to people who


---------106:22----------
have anxiety it's not like their mind


---------106:24----------
runs slow it's like their mind


---------106:26----------
is like super super fast right and so we


---------106:29----------
think about medications for anxiety like


---------106:31----------
some people find that you know marijuana


---------106:33----------
or alcohol


---------106:34----------
like they self-medicate and what do


---------106:36----------
those substances do they slow us down


---------106:39----------
right so they're downers um and then if


---------106:42----------
we think about the class of


---------106:44----------
drugs or chemicals that stimulate us


---------106:47----------
caffeine meth cocaine


---------106:51----------
other kinds of stimulants are going to


---------106:52----------
make anxiety worse


---------106:54----------
so worsening anxiety for example is a


---------106:57----------
potential side effect


---------106:58----------
of ritalin or adderall so any kind of


---------107:02----------
stimulant is


---------107:03----------
can make caffeine worse so i don't think


---------107:04----------
that's just placebo or anything like


---------107:06----------
that um


---------107:08----------
generally speaking you know those uh


---------107:11----------
caffeine is gonna like


---------107:12----------
increase the activity of our neurons and


---------107:14----------
make them kind of jittery and make


---------107:15----------
you know thoughts increase in rapidity


---------107:18----------
and if we just think about it i think a


---------107:19----------
lot of stuff in our body and our mind


---------107:21----------
are two-way streets


---------107:22----------
so if we speed up our mind we're more


---------107:24----------
likely to be anxious


---------107:25----------
and the more anxious we are the quicker


---------107:27----------
our mind goes


---------107:29----------
and if you think about you know what do


---------107:30----------
people want to do with anxiety they just


---------107:32----------
want their mind to slow down they want


---------107:34----------
like everything to slow down


---------107:35----------
i would bet money that when you had the


---------107:37----------
panic attack


---------107:39----------
um your mind was like firing thoughts at


---------107:41----------
you like


---------107:42----------
a thousand thoughts a second you know


---------107:44----------
and it's just like oh my god this and


---------107:45----------
then this and then this and then this


---------107:47----------
and then this


---------107:48----------
and so caffeine puts your mind


---------107:51----------
into a state where it is more vulnerable


---------107:54----------
to that kind of thing


---------107:56----------
you're kind of priming it for rapid


---------107:57----------
thoughts


---------107:59----------
and so anxiety kind of really grows in


---------108:01----------
that sort of soil


---------108:04----------
um so i think it's it's good that you


---------108:06----------
cut caffeine out


---------108:08----------
yeah it can definitely help yeah my


---------108:11----------
my like whole plan i was thinking about


---------108:14----------
eventually if i do


---------108:15----------
introduce it again it would be like


---------108:16----------
before i like only before workouts


---------108:18----------
because i i've always felt like if i


---------108:20----------
have like a like


---------108:22----------
the caffeine is going to something right


---------108:23----------
like i'm going to do a workout so like


---------108:25----------
my brain is focused on that


---------108:27----------
then it would maybe help i'm still not


---------108:29----------
exactly sure how i'm going to implement


---------108:31----------
that but like those are


---------108:32----------
i don't know i just i just wanted to ask


---------108:33----------
you about that because i figured you


---------108:34----------
probably had some insight


---------108:36----------
absolutely so i mean some people do take


---------108:38----------
caffeine as a like a pre-workout


---------108:39----------
supplement right so people will even


---------108:41----------
take like caffeine pills and stuff to


---------108:43----------
improve their workouts um you know i


---------108:46----------
think it sort of makes sense but i think


---------108:47----------
generally speaking you know the more


---------108:49----------
the fewer mind-altering substances you


---------108:51----------
have floating around in your system the


---------108:53----------
more tranquil your mind is going to be


---------108:55----------
and caffeine is i mean yeah


---------108:58----------
yeah other questions um well the last


---------109:01----------
thing i just kind of wanted to talk


---------109:02----------
about i know this is a big subject but i


---------109:05----------
just i don't want to take up too much


---------109:06----------
time


---------109:07----------
um but like with the the thought of


---------109:10----------
like okay because i mean i deal with


---------109:12----------
this so much of people asking me this


---------109:14----------
question


---------109:15----------
um or like thinking this way is like


---------109:17----------
okay i am overweight


---------109:19----------
and i'm unhappy about being overweight


---------109:21----------
so i feel like if i lose the weight


---------109:23----------
then i will be happy right like i guess


---------109:26----------
i'm just asking have you


---------109:28----------
dealt with that and like what would you


---------109:29----------
[Music]


---------109:31----------
maybe like say to someone that might


---------109:32----------
have that like mindset that would be


---------109:33----------
coming to you and asking you about that


---------109:35----------
it's a great question so that is a very


---------109:38----------
complex


---------109:39----------
topic yeah that ultimately has to do


---------109:42----------
with the nature of happiness


---------109:44----------
okay um so we can go into that just very


---------109:47----------
quickly but


---------109:48----------
so the a couple of things the first


---------109:49----------
thing is that it makes sense sometimes


---------109:51----------
for people to feel


---------109:52----------
happier once they lose weight right it's


---------109:55----------
not


---------109:56----------
if you take a thousand people who are


---------109:58----------
overweight and then they all


---------110:00----------
lose weight on the whole the


---------110:03----------
the people that lose weight are more


---------110:05----------
likely to be more happy


---------110:08----------
right so so they're the first thing to


---------110:10----------
acknowledge is that in a lot of cases


---------110:11----------
losing weight does lead people to feel


---------110:13----------
happier and there are physiologic


---------110:15----------
reasons for that and stuff like that you


---------110:17----------
know you just have more energy


---------110:18----------
it's not so much about the weight loss


---------110:19----------
it's about the exercise and the positive


---------110:21----------
effects of exercise


---------110:22----------
your basic metabolic rate can go up


---------110:24----------
things like that you feel


---------110:26----------
less thompson which is another kind of


---------110:28----------
thing


---------110:29----------
which i won't go into but for those of


---------110:30----------
you who are familiar with that


---------110:32----------
so the first thing is that sometimes


---------110:33----------
they feel happy


---------110:35----------
the second thing is that sometimes


---------110:38----------
happiness isn't necessarily due to


---------110:40----------
weight right happiness


---------110:41----------
is like a self-esteem issue or


---------110:44----------
you know feeling like you don't deserve


---------110:46----------
love or attention or things like that


---------110:49----------
which gets tangled up with the weight


---------110:53----------
and and we know that because you even


---------110:55----------
said that like you know when i'm feeling


---------110:57----------
down and my sister is mean to me


---------110:58----------
i go and i find comfort in nachos yeah


---------111:02----------
and that also is like not stupid or


---------111:04----------
anything that's because we actually


---------111:06----------
have you know chemicals in our brain


---------111:09----------
that are released from fatty foods and


---------111:12----------
sugary foods


---------111:14----------
that will actually improve our mood in


---------111:16----------
the short term


---------111:18----------
and so people can start to feel happier


---------111:20----------
through food


---------111:21----------
but what they're doing is they're using


---------111:22----------
food as like kind of an antidote to a


---------111:24----------
deeper set problem


---------111:26----------
and then they start to gain weight their


---------111:28----------
weight gain preys on their pre-existing


---------111:30----------
insecurities


---------111:31----------
and for those people who feel like if i


---------111:33----------
change my weight my


---------111:34----------
i'll be happy and everything will be


---------111:36----------
great that's not gonna work right


---------111:38----------
because it's like the pre-existing


---------111:39----------
insecurity and you're actually


---------111:41----------
a wonderful example of that john because


---------111:43----------
in a lot of ways you have an


---------111:45----------
awesome life that you really enjoy


---------111:46----------
living and that you're grateful for


---------111:48----------
and you have stuff that lingers that is


---------111:51----------
independent of your weight


---------111:52----------
that's the second thing i would tell


---------111:54----------
them so where is the root


---------111:56----------
of your unhappiness and i think a lot of


---------112:00----------
times what happens


---------112:01----------
and the third thing which is really the


---------112:03----------
longer discussion which i'm working on


---------112:05----------
actually a set of videos about this


---------112:07----------
is like where does happiness come from


---------112:09----------
right because a lot of times what


---------112:10----------
happens is people


---------112:11----------
look at being unhappy and what they do


---------112:15----------
is they look at some external thing or


---------112:17----------
even and i even consider to a certain


---------112:18----------
degree


---------112:19----------
your body to be an external thing if i


---------112:22----------
change this


---------112:22----------
about my life then i will be happy


---------112:26----------
and so it's like if i had a girlfriend


---------112:28----------
i'd be happy if i lost weight i'd be


---------112:30----------
happy


---------112:30----------
if i graduated from college i'd be happy


---------112:32----------
if i was in college i'd be happy i


---------112:34----------
wouldn't have to feel ashamed about


---------112:35----------
myself


---------112:36----------
if this thing in the outside world was


---------112:38----------
different


---------112:39----------
and i've worked with some very very


---------112:41----------
successful people who are very very


---------112:42----------
unhappy


---------112:44----------
and what they find is that they chase


---------112:46----------
one thing and then they chase the next


---------112:47----------
thing


---------112:47----------
they chase the next thing and they chase


---------112:49----------
the next thing we did an interview a


---------112:50----------
couple weeks back with gross gore where


---------112:52----------
we sort of talk about that because


---------112:54----------
he was someone who was really like yeah


---------112:55----------
i want the next thing and that's how i'm


---------112:57----------
going to be happy


---------112:59----------
so then let me ask you something


---------113:02----------
if i eat a cookie and i feel happy where


---------113:05----------
does the happiness come from does it


---------113:07----------
come from the cookie or does it come


---------113:08----------
from me


---------113:10----------
yeah i would say it comes from you but


---------113:12----------
the cookie is what made me happy


---------113:14----------
right why do you say it comes from you


---------113:17----------
uh well because like i guess it's like


---------113:21----------
you you chose to eat the cookie and you


---------113:23----------
like it's your choice to to do that and


---------113:25----------
then


---------113:26----------
so you fulfilled something that you were


---------113:28----------
like trying to to do i guess


---------113:30----------
sure so the fulfillment of my desire is


---------113:33----------
what makes me happy


---------113:34----------
yeah yeah yeah right i guess that's the


---------113:36----------
same thing as the cookie


---------113:38----------
no no so i think you're right the


---------113:40----------
happiness does come from me i'm just


---------113:41----------
challenging it a little bit so if we


---------113:43----------
like think about it like


---------113:44----------
it's this idea that like you know if


---------113:46----------
something


---------113:47----------
else like if i get this thing then i'm


---------113:49----------
gonna be happy that that


---------113:50----------
fulfilling my desires is what makes me


---------113:52----------
happy that's what you're saying


---------113:55----------
and that sort of makes sense because we


---------113:56----------
think about it like if i ate one cookie


---------113:59----------
and then i eat a second cookie and a


---------114:01----------
third cookie and a fourth cookie and a


---------114:02----------
fifth cookie


---------114:03----------
what happens to my happiness with


---------114:05----------
subsequent cookies


---------114:07----------
i i personally would say it probably


---------114:08----------
would go down yeah right


---------114:10----------
because too many cookies right exactly


---------114:13----------
so so therefore we can say that like


---------114:15----------
if the happiness really came from the


---------114:17----------
outside thing then the more of the


---------114:19----------
outside thing we get the more happy we'd


---------114:21----------
be


---------114:22----------
and this is what happens with people who


---------114:23----------
chase money right they're like i want a


---------114:25----------
thousand dollars i want ten thousand


---------114:26----------
dollars


---------114:26----------
100 000 i want a million dollars i want


---------114:28----------
two million three million four million


---------114:30----------
five million they just want more


---------114:31----------
more and more because they think that


---------114:33----------
that money is going to bring them


---------114:34----------
happiness


---------114:36----------
but it doesn't the happiness actually


---------114:37----------
comes from in here


---------114:39----------
if you really tunnel down and you look


---------114:40----------
at it and then you also say that the


---------114:42----------
fulfillment of


---------114:43----------
desires is what brings you happiness but


---------114:45----------
you know i think the tricky part with


---------114:46----------
that is if i eat a cookie and i feel


---------114:48----------
sated


---------114:50----------
what happens the next day you want to


---------114:53----------
have another cookie


---------114:54----------
absolutely yeah right so fulfilling your


---------114:58----------
desires actually just


---------115:00----------
buys you more unfulfilled desires in the


---------115:03----------
future


---------115:05----------
which is what we see right so then they


---------115:06----------
lose weight and then they're like i'm


---------115:08----------
still not happy


---------115:10----------
yeah now i want this now i want this now


---------115:13----------
i want this


---------115:15----------
and so chasing after your desires even


---------115:17----------
though it brings us a temporary


---------115:18----------
satisfaction


---------115:20----------
actually signs us up to become more


---------115:23----------
dependent


---------115:24----------
on fulfilling our desires to make


---------115:26----------
ourselves feel better


---------115:30----------
and it's a beast that never grows full


---------115:33----------
it'll always be hungry again


---------115:34----------
the next day and so what would i say to


---------115:38----------
these people probably some combination


---------115:40----------
of all of that


---------115:41----------
that on the one hand if we really look


---------115:43----------
at it scientifically improving your


---------115:44----------
weight is probably going to lead to an


---------115:46----------
increase in mood


---------115:48----------
but that if you have some psychological


---------115:50----------
like unfulfilled need


---------115:53----------
or slow self-esteem that you equate to


---------115:55----------
weight


---------115:56----------
fixing your weight won't be enough it'll


---------115:58----------
help but it won't be enough


---------116:01----------
yeah and that ultimately if you really


---------116:03----------
want to be happy in life you have to


---------116:04----------
really understand that changing anything


---------116:06----------
about your external circumstances is not


---------116:08----------
going to be the real answer


---------116:12----------
and that it really has to do with like


---------116:14----------
accepting yourself as who you are


---------116:16----------
letting go of desire and things like


---------116:17----------
that


---------116:19----------
um yeah does that make sense for sure


---------116:23----------
complete and i usually like yeah go


---------116:25----------
ahead yeah usually what i try and tell


---------116:27----------
tell


---------116:28----------
people is like you can't think of it as


---------116:29----------
like a magic bullet or like a silver


---------116:31----------
bullet


---------116:31----------
or something that's gonna fix everything


---------116:33----------
like there are certain things that yes


---------116:34----------
like if you're


---------116:35----------
really upset that you can't bend down


---------116:37----------
and put your shoes on then yeah losing


---------116:38----------
weight will obviously fix that thing


---------116:40----------
which might make you a little bit happy


---------116:41----------
about that but if it's like you're start


---------116:42----------
like with me like struggle with anxiety


---------116:44----------
or whatever


---------116:44----------
it's like it's not going it's just not


---------116:46----------
going to fix that that thing


---------116:48----------
yeah so okay all right yeah


---------116:51----------
yeah cool any other questions or great


---------116:54----------
questions man


---------116:56----------
no i think that's about it i mean i


---------116:59----------
again like i said i appreciate you


---------117:00----------
taking the time to to talk this was


---------117:02----------
um very insightful um i wanted to say


---------117:05----------
fun but i feel like that's not that but


---------117:06----------
i genuinely did enjoy the conversation


---------117:08----------
yeah but


---------117:09----------
it was uh it was very insightful and


---------117:11----------
interesting


---------117:12----------
yeah uh john i just want to echo again i


---------117:14----------
i think um


---------117:16----------
you know you are a really insightful


---------117:17----------
person i think we


---------117:19----------
i i got to teach a little bit more


---------117:20----------
because i think you had gone


---------117:22----------
halfway there on your own so a lot of


---------117:24----------
times i have to like get


---------117:25----------
people to kind of where you started off


---------117:28----------
um


---------117:29----------
and and so i really enjoyed that i hope


---------117:33----------
i didn't monopolize the conversation too


---------117:34----------
much


---------117:35----------
but no no i i mean what i wanted to say


---------117:38----------
is i think a lot of like


---------117:39----------
not to like try and like sing your


---------117:40----------
praises too much but like i think a lot


---------117:42----------
of it was has been from watching your


---------117:44----------
videos and like


---------117:45----------
because like a lot of times i'll watch


---------117:46----------
them or watch them but i'll listen to


---------117:47----------
them as i'm like on a walk or something


---------117:50----------
and i try and put myself in the position


---------117:52----------
as much as i can


---------117:53----------
um and so i would i would say that's


---------117:55----------
probably why maybe i was able to


---------117:57----------
like you said be halfway there because i


---------117:59----------
i really try to like


---------118:01----------
okay how does this make me feel like you


---------118:02----------
know so um


---------118:05----------
you probably you weren't even you


---------118:06----------
weren't even doing you you you weren't


---------118:08----------
even talking to me but you were helping


---------118:09----------
me at the same time which i know is like


---------118:11----------
exactly why you do this stuff so yeah


---------118:12----------
that's really cool i think i'm really


---------118:14----------
actually happy to hear that john because


---------118:16----------
i hope more people do what you do


---------118:17----------
because


---------118:18----------
i think part of what i'm excited about


---------118:20----------
is teaching people like step two


---------118:23----------
right and i i don't give people much


---------118:25----------
advice because most people are still in


---------118:27----------
the diagnosis phase where they need to


---------118:28----------
figure out what's going on


---------118:30----------
i think you've done such a good job of


---------118:31----------
sort of starting that process that it's


---------118:33----------
like really like


---------118:34----------
call your mom and see what happens right


---------118:36----------
talk to her there are a lot of subtle


---------118:38----------
things because you really have grown


---------118:39----------
it's like


---------118:40----------
the higher you climb you know the


---------118:41----------
thinner the air gets and the harder it


---------118:43----------
is to keep climbing


---------118:45----------
and and that's what's really tricky um


---------118:48----------
and john uh


---------118:49----------
uh the last thing that i want to say is


---------118:51----------
damn sound like you are really an


---------118:53----------
outlier when it comes to the hand that


---------118:54----------
you were dealt


---------118:57----------
and yeah and how far you've come yeah


---------119:00----------
thank you i


---------119:00----------
it's something that i've um it's weird


---------119:04----------
because like i said the thing i struggle


---------119:05----------
with is feeling like i'm not special and


---------119:06----------
stuff but it's something that i've


---------119:07----------
really been like


---------119:09----------
um i've started to notice more and more


---------119:12----------
um and so i try not to uh make it seem


---------119:15----------
like what i've done is like the easy


---------119:17----------
thing that anyone can do it like i try


---------119:19----------
when i say that like i try and put


---------119:20----------
myself in the position of someone that


---------119:22----------
might not be able to do that


---------119:23----------
and like how do i help that person right


---------119:25----------
um but yeah thank you i


---------119:27----------
appreciate that um do you meditate


---------119:32----------
uh i can't say that i do okay that's


---------119:34----------
totally cool man i mean don't do do you


---------119:36----------
feel judged when you have to say no to


---------119:37----------
that question


---------119:39----------
um no i just uh i i've watched a lot of


---------119:42----------
your videos and i know that you a lot of


---------119:43----------
times will do guided meditations


---------119:45----------
um and so i guess i feel like man maybe


---------119:48----------
i should be


---------119:50----------
so so be careful right so don't judge


---------119:52----------
yourself so now this is going to be


---------119:53----------
really really hard


---------119:55----------
okay so be really really really careful


---------119:57----------
okay john this is the final exam


---------119:59----------
so i'm gonna ask you if you want me to


---------120:01----------
teach you some meditation


---------120:04----------
and i want you to answer with not what


---------120:06----------
you should say


---------120:07----------
but what you actually feel yeah


---------120:12----------
i think i would i would like to learn


---------120:14----------
some stuff for sure okay cool


---------120:16----------
so i'm going to teach you some super


---------120:17----------
basic stuff okay i try to teach this


---------120:19----------
periodically have you have you done


---------120:20----------
alternate nostril breathing with us


---------120:22----------
before


---------120:23----------
yes i did uh i think it was


---------120:26----------
it was one of the videos i remember i i


---------120:28----------
did as much as i could because again i


---------120:29----------
was on a walk so i was like that's


---------120:30----------
totally cool


---------120:32----------
so let's let's do it now okay so i try


---------120:34----------
to teach this periodically but i think


---------120:36----------
it's just a great place to


---------120:38----------
um so alternate nostril breathing is


---------120:42----------
gonna be


---------120:43----------
good when you're in those dark moments


---------120:46----------
where you're losing control of yourself


---------120:49----------
if you do even nine breaths of alternate


---------120:51----------
nostril breathing not to say that it's


---------120:52----------
going to be the magic bullet


---------120:54----------
and wipe it all away but i think you're


---------120:56----------
going to be able to take a little bit


---------120:57----------
more control


---------120:59----------
okay so alternate nostril breathing is a


---------121:02----------
should be


---------121:03----------
technique should be means cleansing and


---------121:05----------
i think john what you need to do more


---------121:07----------
than anything


---------121:08----------
else is like clean this crap out because


---------121:10----------
you're killing it


---------121:11----------
in so many different ways that you just


---------121:13----------
your you've got your trash can is filled


---------121:15----------
up


---------121:15----------
in your subconscious you just clean it


---------121:17----------
out so


---------121:19----------
what i'm going to ask you to do is take


---------121:21----------
your right hand and


---------121:22----------
and fold down two fingers yeah that's


---------121:24----------
fine too


---------121:25----------
yeah good yeah um so and then we're


---------121:28----------
gonna put our right thumb


---------121:29----------
on our right nostril and breathe in


---------121:36----------
and when your breath is full we're going


---------121:38----------
to block the other nostril


---------121:39----------
good with your pinky good and breathe


---------121:41----------
out


---------121:45----------
and breathe in through the same nostril


---------121:52----------
switch and breathe out


---------122:00----------
in through the same nostril


---------122:06----------
switch and out


---------122:11----------
if you're watching at home go ahead and


---------122:13----------
join in breathe in


---------122:19----------
switch breathe out


---------122:30----------
in


---------122:34----------
switch out


---------122:42----------
go ahead and continue at your own pace


---------122:45----------
remember to breathe out then in


---------122:48----------
then switch and people may find that one


---------122:52----------
nostril is more closed than the other


---------122:54----------
that's completely normal


---------122:56----------
it's just part of your swara


---------123:26----------
we'll practice for about 60 more seconds


---------124:30----------
go ahead and finish the breath that


---------124:32----------
you're on let your eyes remain closed


---------124:35----------
and just relax


---------125:18----------
foreign


---------125:22----------
i want you to just take a snapshot of


---------125:24----------
who you are in this moment


---------125:31----------
just feel the perfection


---------125:35----------
of your being


---------125:40----------
it's not big it's not small it's not


---------125:43----------
brilliant it's not stupid it's just you


---------125:54----------
and remember that no matter how you feel


---------125:56----------
or what echoes may arise from your


---------125:58----------
subconscious


---------126:01----------
this is who you are


---------126:15----------
and when you're ready come on back


---------126:31----------
my camera seems to have uh meditated as


---------126:34----------
well


---------126:37----------
yes this is actually kind of creepy bro


---------126:40----------
it's very weird


---------126:41----------
one second


---------126:49----------
like chat this is creepy right


---------126:55----------
there we go i was very strange i've


---------126:58----------
never i've never had that happen before


---------127:01----------
yeah i swear sometimes weird stuff


---------127:03----------
happens on this like i


---------127:04----------
like don't know


---------127:07----------
you know i don't know anyway you seem to


---------127:10----------
be back now


---------127:11----------
you feel like you're back yeah i don't


---------127:13----------
know that was


---------127:14----------
it's that's literally never happened


---------127:15----------
this so i'll have it on for hours


---------127:20----------
i i really don't know what to say man


---------127:25----------
i've never i've i've never heard of yeah


---------127:27----------
it's just it's just like too [ __ ]


---------127:29----------
weird of a coincidence


---------127:30----------
right right it really is yeah but like


---------127:32----------
how on earth there's no scientific


---------127:34----------
plausibility for


---------127:35----------
anything that has to do with anything


---------127:37----------
about what just happened there's just


---------127:38----------
nothing it's just all just completely


---------127:40----------
[ __ ]


---------127:41----------
i was i was very confused i like opened


---------127:44----------
my eyes


---------127:44----------
like how did he did he turn off my


---------127:46----------
camera to make it more i was very i was


---------127:48----------
like wait how is it off i don't know


---------127:50----------
it's so weird anyway so i think we found


---------127:53----------
a good technique for your camera


---------127:57----------
so stick with it


---------128:00----------
and listen john i mean i i hope the


---------128:03----------
technique helped you calm yourself a


---------128:04----------
little bit or you know you felt some


---------128:06----------
degree of


---------128:06----------
tranquility or peace no for sure i think


---------128:09----------
like


---------128:10----------
i've heard you explain it like the fact


---------128:11----------
that you have to kind of focus on the


---------128:13----------
what you're doing it definitely helps me


---------128:15----------
because i mean


---------128:16----------
my mind is always going so the fact that


---------128:18----------
i have to okay breathe in and breathe


---------128:20----------
out okay


---------128:21----------
you know what i mean it helps me kind of


---------128:23----------
not worry about like the noises i'm


---------128:25----------
hearing in the background or whatever so


---------128:26----------
great and um john before we wrap up i


---------128:29----------
