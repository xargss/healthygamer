---------00:00----------
so if you're feeling jealous towards


---------00:02----------
other people if you find yourself sort


---------00:04----------
of having this mental frankenstein then


---------00:06----------
i'd highly highly recommend that you


---------00:08----------
sort of really think about where


---------00:09----------
thoughts come from


---------00:11----------
where your own unhappiness comes from


---------00:13----------
understanding the relationship between


---------00:14----------
your unhappiness ego and comparison and


---------00:17----------
then start to learn how to cultivate


---------00:19----------
thoughts in the right direction so we're


---------00:21----------
going to talk i'm going to move to a


---------00:23----------
different prompt for a second but you


---------00:24----------
know basically like


---------00:26----------
i want you all to really think long and


---------00:27----------
hard about like what is the influence of


---------00:30----------
different things on the thoughts in your


---------00:32----------
head


---------00:33----------
okay


---------00:34----------
so what we're going to talk about now is


---------00:35----------
like where do thoughts come from so i


---------00:37----------
know it sounds like kind of a weird


---------00:39----------
question but i'd love to talk to you


---------00:40----------
guys because i think it's really


---------00:41----------
important to understand like where the


---------00:43----------
thoughts in your head come from if


---------00:44----------
you're a doomer if you think that the


---------00:46----------
world is going to hell if you think


---------00:48----------
you're going to be alone for the rest of


---------00:49----------
your life where do those thoughts come


---------00:52----------
from and how can you start to go about


---------00:54----------
controlling your mind so let's take a


---------00:56----------
quick look at a case


---------00:59----------
i am more than my sex life i compare


---------01:01----------
myself to my friends all the time over


---------01:03----------
everything imaginable relationship


---------01:05----------
status social media presence physique


---------01:08----------
mental health career goals sense of


---------01:10----------
humor etc the list goes


---------01:12----------
as specific as you can imagine i compare


---------01:15----------
my friends sex lives to my own


---------01:16----------
non-existent one this is the most


---------01:18----------
embarrassing comparison i make


---------01:21----------
yet the one that affects me the most as


---------01:23----------
a result i'm extremely jealous of my


---------01:25----------
friends on basically every level


---------01:27----------
everything i want my friends seem to


---------01:29----------
have so naturally or they have more of


---------01:31----------
it it's leading me down a spiral where i


---------01:33----------
hate myself the more i hang out with my


---------01:35----------
friends then that jealousy makes me feel


---------01:38----------
like a shitty friend because i want so


---------01:39----------
desperately to be a good friend and be


---------01:41----------
supportive of my friends without having


---------01:43----------
it affect my self-confidence or


---------01:44----------
self-perception but feeling crappy


---------01:46----------
doesn't stop my jealousy so i keep


---------01:48----------
feeling more jealous and then crappier


---------01:51----------
it's a terrible thought loop and i've


---------01:52----------
been struggling for with a year now


---------01:54----------
anyway i'm making this post to remind


---------01:56----------
myself that i'm more than my virginity


---------01:58----------
i'm terrified of relationships even


---------02:00----------
though i want to be in once so


---------02:02----------
desperately so i'm extremely jealous of


---------02:04----------
people who don't struggle with


---------02:06----------
self-loathing to the point where they


---------02:07----------
panic at just the idea of falling in


---------02:09----------
love with someone and having them fall


---------02:11----------
in love with you back i have to believe


---------02:13----------
that i'm more than my virginity even


---------02:15----------
though it feels like my non-existent


---------02:17----------
sex life is indicative of so much more


---------02:20----------
of being unlovable because i'm not


---------02:22----------
giving up


---------02:23----------
i have to remind myself that my


---------02:25----------
virginity doesn't define me unless i let


---------02:27----------
it it's really hard to but i have to


---------02:30----------
it's really hard to feel like i'm living


---------02:31----------
in my friend's shadows when i hang out


---------02:33----------
with them but i have to i'm thankful i


---------02:35----------
found this community and i have this


---------02:37----------
outlet


---------02:38----------
so this is a fantastic post so let's the


---------02:41----------
first thing that i want to point out to


---------02:42----------
y'all is do you guys notice the war


---------02:45----------
that goes on in the mind so the mind


---------02:48----------
sometimes produces


---------02:50----------
particular thoughts and sometimes we


---------02:52----------
fight against those thoughts and there's


---------02:54----------
a lot of exploration of this in in dr


---------02:57----------
k's guide and this is something that i


---------02:58----------
think would be really good because there


---------03:00----------
are a lot of points in dr k's guide that


---------03:02----------
i would encourage this person to check


---------03:04----------
out one is the mental frankenstein so


---------03:06----------
when our mind makes comparisons


---------03:09----------
what it always does is since those


---------03:11----------
comparisons tend to be fueled by


---------03:14----------
insecurities what our mind constructs is


---------03:17----------
a mental frankenstein


---------03:18----------
anytime i make a comparison i make a


---------03:21----------
comparison that proves my own insecurity


---------03:24----------
so i don't compare 10 dimensions against


---------03:26----------
one person what i do is i compare


---------03:30----------
10 people and i look at the best things


---------03:33----------
that each of those people do and i i


---------03:35----------
pick the best things for from 10 people


---------03:38----------
and i compare them to myself so this


---------03:40----------
person says i compare myself to my


---------03:42----------
friends in all aspects careers sex life


---------03:46----------
how they look how social they are and so


---------03:48----------
if your mind wants to if you have that


---------03:50----------
feeling


---------03:51----------
feeling of insecurity what you'll do is


---------03:53----------
create this mental frankenstein of how


---------03:56----------
you were inferior all the time to


---------03:58----------
everyone and it's a very unfair


---------04:00----------
comparison


---------04:02----------
so then the question becomes okay so


---------04:04----------
like if you're having these kinds of


---------04:05----------
thoughts this person is trying to say


---------04:06----------
okay i'm more than my virginity etc so


---------04:09----------
what do you do in this situation what do


---------04:11----------
you do if you make lots of comparisons


---------04:13----------
and you feel really jealous of the


---------04:16----------
people that you care about right so


---------04:18----------
there are two things that you can do one


---------04:20----------
is you can get to the root of the


---------04:21----------
insecurity so there's a very important


---------04:24----------
yogic principle


---------04:25----------
that sort of shows where insecurities


---------04:27----------
come from and why we compare when we


---------04:29----------
have insecurities so we'll get to that


---------04:30----------
in a second


---------04:32----------
the second thing that we can do is


---------04:33----------
cultivate the right kinds of thoughts so


---------04:36----------
what is this yogic principle i'm talking


---------04:37----------
about


---------04:39----------
so anytime that your mind feels negative


---------04:42----------
emotion or feels insecure


---------04:45----------
there's a part of your mind called the


---------04:47----------
ahamkar which activates


---------04:49----------
and the aham god is your ego and is sort


---------04:51----------
of like the bouncer of your mind so


---------04:53----------
anytime you feel insecure the ahm god


---------04:55----------
will activate and will do one of two


---------04:57----------
things it'll either pump yourself up or


---------05:00----------
put other people down or it'll make


---------05:02----------
comparisons so if we kind of think about


---------05:04----------
it all kind of comparison is coming from


---------05:07----------
the ego so it's sort of like you know


---------05:09----------
anytime i compare myself to someone else


---------05:12----------
to make that comparison i have to have


---------05:14----------
an idea of myself and what i am all


---------05:18----------
comparison is driven by ego so like if i


---------05:20----------
look at someone else and i genuinely


---------05:22----------
appreciate them and i don't think about


---------05:24----------
myself i'm like oh look at how happy my


---------05:25----------
friend is he got a you know he found a


---------05:28----------
new partner it sounds like he's like


---------05:29----------
crushing it and he's like really in love


---------05:31----------
like that's fantastic


---------05:33----------
notice that that appreciation


---------05:36----------
has to in order for that appreciation to


---------05:38----------
exist there can't be any ego involved


---------05:42----------
the second that my mind produces oh let


---------05:44----------
me compare that to myself because all


---------05:47----------
comparisons are going to have like at


---------05:49----------
least ego comparisons are going to be


---------05:51----------
comparisons to yourself


---------05:53----------
so that's going to involve ego ego steps


---------05:55----------
and then i start thinking about who i am


---------05:57----------
in my identity because you can't make


---------05:59----------
that comparison unless you have a


---------06:01----------
particular identity


---------06:03----------
so what should you do about that so that


---------06:05----------
insecurity or that ego is gonna come


---------06:08----------
back to some kind of emotional


---------06:10----------
experience or emotion that you're


---------06:12----------
feeling and as you work on the source of


---------06:15----------
that emotion what's gonna happen is the


---------06:17----------
ego will actually calm down and then


---------06:20----------
you'll be able to appreciate what your


---------06:22----------
friends have because then like you know


---------06:24----------
you have no insecurity that that goes


---------06:26----------
that underlies that ego fuel


---------06:29----------
so then the question becomes okay how do


---------06:30----------
i work on my internal emotions so this


---------06:33----------
is something that you can you know if


---------06:35----------
you have clinical concerns or things


---------06:37----------
like that this is something that


---------06:38----------
absolutely um you know therapists can


---------06:40----------
help you do this is something that we


---------06:42----------
train our coaches to do which is sort of


---------06:44----------
like help you understand your emotions


---------06:46----------
and where those kinds of like emotions


---------06:48----------
come from and it turns out that as you


---------06:50----------
start to like recognize the underlying


---------06:52----------
emotion like the jealousy and the ego


---------06:55----------
above it will start to fall apart


---------06:57----------
because the only way that you can be


---------06:58----------
jealous of someone is if you yourself


---------07:00----------
don't have something so this is the


---------07:02----------
question that i would ask this person if


---------07:04----------
you were in a healthy loving


---------07:06----------
relationship that was like positively


---------07:08----------
sexual would you still feel jealous of


---------07:10----------
your friends and the answer is almost


---------07:13----------
certainly overwhelmingly no right and so


---------07:16----------
if we really think about that then


---------07:18----------
what is the what is the key to disarming


---------07:21----------
jealousy it has nothing to do with them


---------07:23----------
they haven't changed at all their


---------07:25----------
situation is actually exactly the same


---------07:27----------
what needs to change is you what needs


---------07:29----------
to change is your perception of yourself


---------07:33----------
because the other interesting thing is


---------07:34----------
that you don't have to have a


---------07:36----------
relationship that is loving in order to


---------07:38----------
stop feeling jealous towards other


---------07:40----------
people that's what we think so we always


---------07:42----------
think that sort of fixing something on


---------07:44----------
the in the external world will be the


---------07:46----------
solution to our internal problems but


---------07:48----------
what you really need to do is work on


---------07:50----------
that sense of being unlovable work on


---------07:53----------
that sense of being ashamed work on that


---------07:55----------
sense that you'll be alone forever right


---------07:57----------
so this person even says


---------07:59----------
i'm terrified of relationships even


---------08:01----------
though i want to be one


---------08:03----------
so desperately i'm extremely jealous of


---------08:05----------
people who don't struggle with


---------08:07----------
self-loathing to the point where they


---------08:08----------
panic and this is what you need to fix


---------08:10----------
right why are you terrified of


---------08:12----------
relationships why do you struggle with


---------08:14----------
self-loathing like you know like why do


---------08:17----------
you panic at the idea of falling in love


---------08:19----------
as long as these things are there


---------08:23----------
that jealousy will continue to exist


---------08:26----------
right so then the question becomes when


---------08:27----------
did you start to feel


---------08:29----------
like like when did you start to become


---------08:31----------
terrified of relationships how did your


---------08:33----------
brain learn


---------08:34----------
to fear relationships and as you do that


---------08:38----------
kind of work as you ask those kinds of


---------08:40----------
questions as you work through those


---------08:41----------
issues then the jealousy will actually


---------08:43----------
collapse it'll like just kind of fizzle


---------08:46----------
apart right as your own insecurities


---------08:49----------
start to get metabolized as you start to


---------08:51----------
build confidence the jealousy will


---------08:53----------
actually kind of just it'll fall apart


---------08:55----------
because it has no basis because the


---------08:57----------
jealousy is based on an idea of what you


---------09:00----------
don't have and that idea of what you


---------09:02----------
don't have is based on your fear your


---------09:04----------
shame your sense of unlovableness so the


---------09:07----------
second thing that you can do is be


---------09:09----------
careful about the way that you cultivate


---------09:10----------
thoughts


---------09:12----------
so when we talk about cultivating


---------09:13----------
thoughts what i mean is that if you


---------09:15----------
really think about it and there's a lot


---------09:16----------
of information about this in the the


---------09:18----------
guides by the way


---------09:19----------
so if you think about where does a


---------09:21----------
thought come from right so we were just


---------09:22----------
talking a little bit about you know how


---------09:24----------
the world is going to hell


---------09:26----------
where does the idea that the world is


---------09:27----------
going to hell come from it comes from


---------09:29----------
external sources right it comes from the


---------09:31----------
indriyas and when i get exposed to


---------09:34----------
things through my sense organs either


---------09:36----------
through sight or sound that exposure


---------09:38----------
will create particular thoughts so i


---------09:41----------
don't know if you guys is going to sound


---------09:42----------
like kind of a weird question but how


---------09:44----------
many people do you thought


---------09:46----------
how many people do you think we're


---------09:47----------
looking forward to wow classic in 1979


---------09:53----------
not a single one right no one was


---------09:55----------
looking forward to wow classic in 1979.


---------09:58----------
why is that why did no one look why did


---------10:00----------
no one think about wow classic in 1979


---------10:03----------
because their indriyas had never gotten


---------10:05----------
sense exposure to it right when did


---------10:07----------
people start to look forward to wow


---------10:08----------
classic when their sense organs


---------10:10----------
encountered something if you think about


---------10:12----------
people who are addicted to video games


---------10:14----------
why are they addicted to video games


---------10:15----------
it's because their mind dwells in those


---------10:18----------
thoughts all the time when i play a game


---------10:21----------
i'm thinking about it right so the more


---------10:23----------
time that my mind spends thinking about


---------10:26----------
a game the more hours it spends thinking


---------10:28----------
about a game then when i turn the game


---------10:30----------
off i've cultivated i've spent a lot of


---------10:33----------
time growing those kinds of thoughts so


---------10:35----------
even when i'm not playing the game i'm


---------10:36----------
thinking about the game and this makes a


---------10:38----------
lot of sense if you look at games that


---------10:39----------
actually aren't fun to play


---------10:42----------
if you talk to people who are addicted


---------10:43----------
to video games


---------10:45----------
what they'll say is that i don't even


---------10:46----------
enjoy playing the game anymore like you


---------10:48----------
talk to law players or dota players or


---------10:50----------
like whatever and they'll say like


---------10:51----------
it's frustrating to play it's not


---------10:53----------
actually fun but i can't stop and even


---------10:56----------
when they're not playing the game they


---------10:57----------
like start thinking about the game when


---------10:59----------
they go to bed they think about their


---------11:00----------
game they're like oh my god that game


---------11:02----------
was so crappy i hated it that person fed


---------11:04----------
so much and so what it turns out is that


---------11:07----------
your the thoughts in your head can


---------11:09----------
actually be cultivated right so the more


---------11:12----------
sensory exposure that you get to a


---------11:14----------
particular thing the more you will


---------11:15----------
cultivate that thing we also see this in


---------11:18----------
cases of trauma right so if someone


---------11:19----------
grows up in an emotionally abusive


---------11:22----------
household where they're told that


---------11:23----------
they're like a crappy person and that


---------11:25----------
they're not worth anything


---------11:27----------
that sensory exposure will start to


---------11:29----------
create thought-generating machines in


---------11:31----------
the mind and that's what they'll think


---------11:33----------
to themselves all the time thoughts


---------11:35----------
begin from kind of the outside world


---------11:37----------
right they come in through our sensory


---------11:38----------
organs so you have to be very careful


---------11:40----------
about what kinds of thoughts you


---------11:42----------
cultivate the second thing is that once


---------11:45----------
a thought enters your mind you can


---------11:47----------
choose to engage with it or you can


---------11:49----------
choose not to engage with it and we see


---------11:51----------
evidence of that here too i compare


---------11:53----------
myself to my friends all the time over


---------11:56----------
everything imaginable so as long as you


---------11:59----------
are giving in to that desire to compare


---------12:01----------
as long as you are letting thought


---------12:03----------
number one compare to thought


---------12:05----------
chain into thought number two and grow


---------12:07----------
thought number three what i want you


---------12:09----------
guys to to realize is that this person


---------12:12----------
has a gigantic fruit-bearing tree and


---------12:15----------
the fruits that it actually grows are


---------12:17----------
comparative thoughts and we see that it


---------12:19----------
compares to all kinds of stuff right


---------12:22----------
because at this point


---------12:23----------
this person is compared so much has


---------12:25----------
cultivated all of these thoughts of


---------12:27----------
comparison that the second they start to


---------12:29----------
make one comparison their mind they'll


---------12:32----------
give into it and their mind will make a


---------12:33----------
second comparison third comparison


---------12:35----------
fourth comparison fifth comparison and


---------12:37----------
then when they go see their friend and


---------12:38----------
their friend is like you know there with


---------12:40----------
their new


---------12:41----------
like girlfriend or boyfriend


---------12:43----------
that sensory trigger will activate this


---------12:46----------
complex within the mind that has been


---------12:48----------
heavily heavily cultivated fertilized


---------12:51----------
watered and then the comparison train


---------12:52----------
will begin


---------12:54----------
so then the question becomes how do i


---------12:56----------
stop cultivating a particular thought


---------12:59----------
so what you need to do is notice


---------13:02----------
that when your mind starts to make


---------13:04----------
comparisons that you can indulge in that


---------13:06----------
thought or you cannot indulge in that


---------13:08----------
thought you can start to change the way


---------13:10----------
that you think and we see that this


---------13:12----------
person is doing that too right so as i


---------13:15----------
make anyway i'm making this post to


---------13:16----------
remind myself that i am more than my


---------13:18----------
virginity right so what this person is


---------13:21----------
doing is like the thought comes comes up


---------13:24----------
in their mind that i am based on my sex


---------13:27----------
my value as a human being is based on my


---------13:29----------
sexual experience and there's another


---------13:32----------
possibility that you can sort of start


---------13:34----------
to cultivate thoughts that actually you


---------13:36----------
know my value as a human being doesn't


---------13:38----------
necessarily have to relate to my


---------13:39----------
virginity


---------13:41----------
there are actually things that you can


---------13:42----------
do that will cultivate thoughts in a


---------13:44----------
different direction


---------13:45----------
so one recommendation that i'd have for


---------13:47----------
people who experience a lot of jealousy


---------13:49----------
is ask yourself if you were in a happy


---------13:52----------
place


---------13:53----------
would you still feel ill will towards


---------13:56----------
the other person


---------13:57----------
and then if the answer to that question


---------13:59----------
is probably no you wouldn't feel ill


---------14:01----------
well like so if you feel jealous of


---------14:03----------
someone else's relationship ask yourself


---------14:05----------
if i am if i was happier in my


---------14:07----------
relationship would i be jealous then the


---------14:09----------
answer is no and then what you ask


---------14:11----------
yourself is okay so what am i unhappy


---------14:14----------
about in my relationship and as you do


---------14:17----------
that what you're going to be kind of


---------14:18----------
doing two things one is you're going to


---------14:20----------
be


---------14:20----------
stopping the process of cultivating


---------14:22----------
comparative thoughts you're going to be


---------14:24----------
sort of reigning in the jealousy because


---------14:25----------
if you don't ask yourself that question


---------14:27----------
you're going to think about how jealous


---------14:28----------
you are you're going to think about how


---------14:30----------
good they have it and for the next 30


---------14:31----------
minutes you're going to be fertilizing


---------14:33----------
your comparison tree


---------14:35----------
so instead ask yourself what am i


---------14:36----------
unhappy about and then as you go through


---------14:38----------
that introspection not only are you


---------14:40----------
stopping the cultivation of comparison


---------14:42----------
you were also introspecting about your


---------14:44----------
own unhappiness


---------14:46----------
and as you sort of start to ask those


---------14:48----------
questions and hopefully do it in sort of


---------14:49----------
a productive way where you start to try


---------14:51----------
to remain a little bit objective try to


---------14:53----------
accept yourself for who you are


---------14:55----------
hopefully you'll get to the root of the


---------14:57----------
your unhappiness and you'll start to


---------14:59----------
metabolize that as well


---------15:01----------
so if you're feeling jealous towards


---------15:03----------
other people if you find yourself sort


---------15:05----------
of having this mental frankenstein then


---------15:07----------
i'd highly highly recommend that you


---------15:09----------
sort of really think about where


---------15:10----------
thoughts come from where your own


---------15:13----------
unhappiness comes from understanding the


---------15:15----------
relationship between your unhappiness


---------15:17----------
ego and comparison and then start to


---------15:19----------
learn how to cultivate thoughts in the


---------15:21----------
right direction there are a lot of


---------15:23----------
different things in dr k's guide that


---------15:24----------
relate to this concept and this is sort


---------15:26----------
of like why it's hard because there's


---------15:28----------
not going to be one video about this but


---------15:29----------
there's actually half a dozen videos so


---------15:31----------
i'd recommend looking at the video on


---------15:33----------
sangha or community that's a video that


---------15:35----------
explains where thoughts come from


---------15:38----------
there's another video about you know the


---------15:40----------
mental frankenstein i think it's falling


---------15:42----------
behind and the depression uh


---------15:44----------
the depression guide but this concept of


---------15:47----------
like how do we make comparisons there's


---------15:49----------
a lot of stuff in the meditation guide


---------15:51----------
about the nature of confidence versus


---------15:53----------
ego and where ego comes from and what is


---------15:55----------
ego there's a long lecture like almost


---------15:58----------
an hour-long lecture on vedic psychology


---------16:00----------
that explains the relationship between


---------16:02----------
your emotions and your ego and your


---------16:04----------
intellect and how we make different


---------16:06----------
kinds of comparisons so there's a lot of


---------16:08----------
good stuff in there there's not a


---------16:09----------
specific video about this but i think as


---------16:12----------
you understand all of those different


---------16:13----------
concepts hopefully you'll be able to


---------16:16----------
like really get a good handle on sort of


---------16:18----------
what we talked about today


---------16:19----------
very shelley's for aging in her grave no


---------16:21----------
i think mary shelley shouldn't be raging


---------16:23----------
i think that she's done a very good job


---------16:28----------
i guess frankenstein's monster


---------16:30----------
maybe that's why she's raging in her


---------16:31----------
grave but


---------16:32----------
um i i think she did a wonderful job of


---------16:34----------
giving us a concept that we can then use


---------16:38----------
because frankenstein isn't isn't the


---------16:40----------
thing that was stitched together right


---------16:41----------
it was the doctor fair enough
