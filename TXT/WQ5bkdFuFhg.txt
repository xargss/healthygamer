---------00:03----------

---------00:06----------
and so what's your name friend Zach or


---------00:10----------

---------00:14----------

---------00:18----------
cool


---------00:19----------
nice to meet you Zach I'm I'm although


---------00:21----------

---------00:23----------

---------00:25----------

---------00:27----------

---------00:29----------
it's not all maple it's all oak all oak


---------00:32----------
okay perfect just like the original Sun


---------00:34----------
script okay awesome man


---------00:37----------
so Zach I don't everyone is super


---------00:40----------
excited that we're talking and I'm not


---------00:42----------
sure exactly why but they seem to be


---------00:45----------
super excited do you have any idea I've


---------00:48----------
had a very interesting history I mean I


---------00:51----------
think that I don't know if you've looked


---------00:52----------
at any of my previous stuff at all but I


---------00:54----------
think that one of the most I guess


---------00:58----------
famous or I guess infamous things about


---------01:00----------
me is my room has always been very dirty


---------01:03----------
and so a lot of people correlate that


---------01:06----------
with something being wrong with you or


---------01:08----------
something like that and sure they did


---------01:10----------
they probably think that something like


---------01:12----------
that has to do with it I do have to


---------01:14----------
disappoint people though my room


---------01:15----------
actually is pretty clean right now


---------01:17----------
though I apologize okay so I mean but


---------01:20----------
what do you think it what conclusions do


---------01:23----------
people draw about the dirtiness of your


---------01:25----------
room in you ah basically that I don't


---------01:28----------
have my life together it's a complete


---------01:30----------
mess I'm depressed I I think so don't


---------01:33----------
not having my life together my life


---------01:35----------
being a complete mess for most of my


---------01:37----------
life that's probably true but okay the


---------01:41----------
part where yeah yeah I mean let's be


---------01:43----------
real


---------01:43----------
but depressed mmm hard to say III don't


---------01:48----------
really think depressed is the right word


---------01:49----------
what would you use to describe it there


---------01:53----------
oh I mean like there I I think it's just


---------01:56----------
lazy


---------01:58----------
obviously like yeah yeah lazy I think


---------02:02----------
that's really the main thing like there


---------02:03----------
have been times that I have been


---------02:04----------
depressed about certain things sure had


---------02:07----------
medical problems with my parents I've


---------02:09----------
had you know ups and downs in my stream


---------02:13----------
things have made me depressed like


---------02:15----------
situationally but not gone I believe


---------02:18----------
like a mental level sure so help me


---------02:21----------
understand what what what do you mean by


---------02:23----------
lazy so there is one time that my alarm


---------02:28----------
went off in my in my room I was like


---------02:31----------
tired to wake up and die instead of


---------02:33----------
turning off the alarm


---------02:34----------
I let the alarm go for two hours maybe


---------02:37----------
three hours until the arm died okay can


---------02:41----------
you hold on just one second yeah my


---------02:43----------
Boomer ass needs to make a phone call


---------02:45----------
because I may be doing something wrong


---------02:50----------
thanks for being with me and I


---------02:52----------
appreciate it it's no problem then


---------02:56----------
usually trendex it's okay it's okay five


---------02:58----------
minutes okay cool we fix it all right so


---------03:01----------
you're saying sorry I think we're good


---------03:03----------
now so you you said that you were you're


---------03:08----------
lazy because there was a yes I think


---------03:12----------
that was just it's more or less a


---------03:14----------
metaphor of how lazy I am why am i lazy


---------03:16----------
because it's easier to not do anything


---------03:19----------
than do something that's fundamentally


---------03:22----------
what it is and I'm I'm very good at


---------03:26----------
adapting the things whenever they go


---------03:29----------
wrong I grew up very poor so if a light


---------03:33----------
goes out I just stopped using that room


---------03:35----------
yep that's that's how that's pretty much


---------03:39----------
it and sorry this is the last


---------03:41----------
interruption I promise I just got a tea


---------03:43----------
delivery how convenient that's great yes


---------03:48----------
it's actually really awesome um so tell


---------03:51----------
me you said that you learned how to


---------03:52----------
adapt by like you know something breaks


---------03:54----------
like you just learn how to live without


---------03:55----------
it yeah like I've had a box fan duct


---------04:01----------
tape to the side of my PC whenever I my


---------04:03----------
fan on my graphics card broke because I


---------04:05----------
couldn't afford a new one I literally


---------04:08----------
had a bike with one pedal whenever I was


---------04:10----------
a kid I I mean there's plenty of other


---------04:13----------
examples but yeah I mean I grew up


---------04:15----------
pretty poor so I'm just used to you know


---------04:18----------
if things don't go the way that I want


---------04:19----------
them to that's okay and I just do


---------04:21----------
whatever I can


---------04:22----------
and


---------04:23----------
when you so where did you grow up if you


---------04:25----------
don't mind me asking Austin Texas okay


---------04:28----------
we're in Austin whereabouts uh I don't


---------04:31----------
like to say okay cuz like oh yeah yeah I


---------04:33----------
don't but I I grew up in a poor part of


---------04:35----------
Austin not not forget very poor I don't


---------04:38----------
want it make sound like this is a rags


---------04:40----------
to riches story it's just a thrift store


---------04:43----------
clothes to riches story or maybe not


---------04:45----------
quite riches but slightly more


---------04:47----------
successful than I was sure and are you


---------04:49----------
still yeah I know I'm not supposed to


---------04:51----------
ask people kind of where they live but I


---------04:53----------
I get excited about people who are in


---------04:55----------
Texas because I grew up in Texas East


---------04:58----------
Texas went to school in Austin I'm back


---------05:01----------
in Texas now really happy to be back


---------05:03----------
here awesome


---------05:04----------
yep yeah before I before I stopped


---------05:07----------
before I started streaming I actually


---------05:09----------
was planning on going to to UT law or


---------05:11----------
maybe Baylor good thing on which one I


---------05:13----------
would get accepted to cool it then I


---------05:15----------
decided to uh play World of Warcraft


---------05:16----------
instead can you tell me a little bit


---------05:18----------
more about what and growing up was like


---------05:20----------
sure I actually to be to be honest with


---------05:25----------
you I actually really enjoyed my my


---------05:28----------
experience growing up trend I had a lot


---------05:30----------
of like really great memories and uh in


---------05:33----------
a way I'm almost sad that I can't just


---------05:35----------
relive it now honestly like I had I was


---------05:38----------
surrounded by all my friends my family


---------05:40----------
my parents were well in general I was


---------05:44----------
very happy oh yeah


---------05:48----------
yeah I mean like there were negatives of


---------05:50----------
course there were negatives but if I


---------05:52----------
look back on it I I can't say that I


---------05:55----------
regret a thing sure yeah I think one of


---------05:58----------
the most confusing things for people is


---------05:59----------
that they assume that being poor means


---------06:02----------
that you're you will grew up unhappy and


---------06:04----------
also that being rich means that you grew


---------06:07----------
up happy or that you are happy and one


---------06:11----------
day we weirdest things that I remember


---------06:13----------
there was used to work in jail and I was


---------06:17----------
just really surprised because I had one


---------06:19----------
patient so I would work in to jail like


---------06:21----------
basically one day a week and you know I


---------06:24----------
had like a clinic outside of the jail so


---------06:28----------
I had like regular quote unquote regular


---------06:30----------
patients and then I would see people in


---------06:32----------
jail and one of the things that really


---------06:34----------
struck me is that I had a guy who was an


---------06:36----------
invest


---------06:36----------
banker and like he was suffering just


---------06:42----------
about the same as the dude who was in


---------06:43----------
jail and it was like a really weird


---------06:45----------
thing to like realize but if you really


---------06:47----------
just asked me like how much is this


---------06:49----------
person suffering on a scale of one to


---------06:50----------
ten both of them were suffering the same


---------06:53----------
amount and also the Burghley huh


---------06:56----------
successes of prison I you know it's


---------07:00----------
funny you say that but I think that I've


---------07:02----------
been working a lot with people with


---------07:04----------
impostor syndrome recently and I think


---------07:06----------
in a sense that really can be which I


---------07:07----------
know is bizarre I think there's a lot of


---------07:10----------
gatekeeping around suffering and who's


---------07:11----------
allowed to suffer and also gatekeeping


---------07:13----------
around happiness because like who are


---------07:15----------
you like if you grew up and you were


---------07:16----------
poor like how can you possibly be happy


---------07:18----------
like how does that work I completely


---------07:21----------
agree with you I know that um so this


---------07:24----------
happened I've taken a number of breaks


---------07:26----------
from streaming about like three


---------07:28----------
technically but two like more popular


---------07:30----------
ones and or more known once and before


---------07:33----------
that I was streaming a games a classic


---------07:35----------
Wow and I my stream was seeing success


---------07:39----------
that had never seen before like I was


---------07:41----------
getting up to like a hundred thousand


---------07:42----------
viewers and I had like thirty thousand


---------07:45----------
subscribers it was very very very


---------07:47----------
successful but I was actually enjoying


---------07:49----------
myself a lot less and I was whenever I


---------07:52----------
had you know comparatively only like


---------07:54----------
twenty five or thirty thousand viewers


---------07:56----------
playing before classic Wow it came out


---------07:59----------
and I I realized at that point that


---------08:02----------
there were a number of times that I had


---------08:04----------
wanted to go after and like meet a


---------08:06----------
certain goal so I think my main goal


---------08:08----------
that I'd always wanted to hit was 10,000


---------08:11----------
like average viewers are hitting 10,000


---------08:13----------
viewers period and then once I hit that


---------08:15----------
goal I didn't really feel anything it


---------08:17----------
didn't feel good and it's always been a


---------08:21----------
pursuit of doing more and more and more


---------08:24----------
and I think that after I did classic Wow


---------08:26----------
and I had that experience with which is


---------08:30----------
what you're saying with the investment


---------08:31----------
banker and I was doing so well and I was


---------08:34----------
so unhappy and I was stressed out and


---------08:36----------
not enjoying myself I realized that you


---------08:39----------
know there might be a little bit more to


---------08:40----------
this and what do you think is what what


---------08:44----------
is that more I would say like


---------08:49----------
since a purpose internal fulfillment


---------08:51----------
maybe something like that uh uh you know


---------08:54----------
for me personally I I always felt like


---------08:57----------
in a way that I kind of embody something


---------08:59----------
that's in a way like kind of meaningful


---------09:02----------
to a lot of people and they want to


---------09:05----------
watch a stream and see that kind of


---------09:07----------
exists and for many people I might


---------09:09----------
represent you know remind them of an old


---------09:12----------
friend or you know maybe an opportunity


---------09:14----------
that they didn't have of being Who I am


---------09:16----------
you know I'm a guy I'm you know almost


---------09:18----------
30 now and I play video games all day I


---------09:20----------
live with my mom and I would say that in


---------09:23----------
many regards I'm quite content not all


---------09:26----------
but many regards I'm quite content and I


---------09:28----------
think they don't number people like kind


---------09:30----------
of resonate with that because for many


---------09:33----------
of them it's a road not taken' and I I


---------09:35----------
feel like I kind of had this


---------09:37----------
responsibility as being a creator of


---------09:40----------
being that person for other people out


---------09:42----------
there who didn't really have the


---------09:43----------
opportunity to do that and more so also


---------09:46----------
for younger people because video games


---------09:48----------
were very transformative and whenever I


---------09:50----------
grew up and I think that the experience


---------09:52----------
that I had playing World War Craft


---------09:54----------
whoever I was 16 17 you know around that


---------09:58----------
age you don't really have the same


---------09:59----------
experiences and abilities to you know


---------10:02----------
prove yourself as an individual you know


---------10:04----------
you're a 16 year old loser 17 year old


---------10:06----------
loser who cares what you think


---------10:07----------
but the moment that I got put on even


---------10:09----------
playing field with everybody else you


---------10:11----------
know like kids there were 12 and guys


---------10:13----------
that were as old as my teachers and I


---------10:15----------
was able to succeed in that I think that


---------10:17----------
built up a lot of self-esteem and


---------10:18----------
confidence with me and because of that I


---------10:21----------
feel like I've always tried to promote


---------10:23----------
that type of environment for other


---------10:25----------
people because it was so impactful and


---------10:27----------
meaningful for me and it's oh oh go


---------10:31----------
ahead no go for it


---------10:32----------
oh well so whenever I was doing what I


---------10:34----------
was doing in classic Wow and playing it


---------10:36----------
the way that I was and having the type


---------10:37----------
of stream atmosphere I felt like


---------10:39----------
fundamentally I had moved away from that


---------10:41----------
and I think that was a big problem yeah


---------10:44----------
do you think about this stuff a lot oh


---------10:46----------
yeah I make videos about it constantly


---------10:49----------
III think about it a lot I I lay in bed


---------10:51----------
I I think all the time oftentimes I'll


---------10:54----------
lay in bed and instead of like watching


---------10:56----------
a movie I'll just sit there and think


---------10:58----------
yeah I really appreciate I appreciate


---------11:01----------
you as a thinker


---------11:03----------
I I try to be I mean I feel like it's


---------11:07----------
something that's not as common nowadays


---------11:08----------
and I feel like people feel like they


---------11:11----------
need to have like an external type of


---------11:15----------
validation or external type of mike-mike


---------11:20----------
reinforcement


---------11:22----------
uh well a viewer account is like a very


---------11:26----------
guess yes like of your account basically


---------11:29----------
but it goes with everything it's like


---------11:31----------
people that feel like oh they're not


---------11:32----------
doing enough in their real life or


---------11:34----------
they're not meeting these standards


---------11:36----------
according to what celebrities are doing


---------11:38----------
on on Instagram they're not making


---------11:40----------
enough money compared to their friends I


---------11:42----------
think this is you know it's prevalent


---------11:45----------
throughout everyone yeah sounds like a


---------11:48----------
very comparative world here describing


---------11:50----------
oh yeah I mean I think everybody is


---------11:52----------
being compared especially with social


---------11:54----------
media you know you have so many


---------11:55----------
quantitative measurements of a person's


---------11:58----------
perceived value mm-hmm that it's very


---------12:01----------
unhealthy so I would love to hear you


---------12:06----------
talk more and at the same time I'm I'm


---------12:08----------
kind of trying to remember or hold on to


---------12:12----------
the idea that sometimes people hear you


---------12:16----------
know a lot of our audience I think


---------12:17----------
benefits from people sort of sharing


---------12:19----------
their personal stories as opposed to


---------12:22----------
intellectualizing or philosophizing


---------12:24----------
which i think is certainly valuable and


---------12:25----------
I'm curious is there something in


---------12:27----------
particular that you'd want to talk about


---------12:29----------
today that you maybe want to work on or


---------12:33----------
want help with or want to better


---------12:35----------
understand sure um I think that if I was


---------12:40----------
gonna go with anything I would say the


---------12:41----------
failure to commit to things and the


---------12:43----------
failure to actually execute on plans


---------12:45----------
that I have okay I've had a number of


---------12:48----------
plans and I think I'm probably a victim


---------12:50----------
of my own laziness more so than a lot of


---------12:54----------
other things and like there are a number


---------12:57----------
of like ideas I've had for streams that


---------12:59----------
I just haven't really done for example


---------13:02----------
I've had like technical difficulties


---------13:04----------
with my stream that have just existed


---------13:06----------
for months now and I just ignore them


---------13:08----------
and they diminish the quality of the


---------13:10----------
stream and the weird thing about it is


---------13:13----------
that whenever I actually go through and


---------13:15----------
I clear out all my message


---------13:17----------
or I do something like that I don't


---------13:18----------
really like you know I'm not really a


---------13:20----------
agoraphobic or anything like that but I


---------13:22----------
also like to be alone and so you know in


---------13:25----------
some ways I don't really like going and


---------13:27----------
uh talking to people and I just want to


---------13:31----------
be left alone basically and I I do that


---------13:34----------
for a while and then I think a lot of


---------13:37----------
people can probably relate to this is


---------13:38----------
that I won't respond to somebody for a


---------13:40----------
while


---------13:40----------
and then I won't respond to them after


---------13:42----------
that because I feel like it's outside of


---------13:44----------
the normal societal expectation or you


---------13:47----------
know later yeah it's too late now


---------13:50----------
oh man too bad you know I guess I'm just


---------13:52----------
gonna ignore it again and so I've I've


---------13:56----------
done that a lot and it's been a problem


---------13:58----------
I think with a lot of like kind of


---------14:00----------
friendships I've had and everything like


---------14:03----------
that and also like kind of focusing on


---------14:05----------
my stream a little bit too much I think


---------14:07----------
really burned me out before and I used


---------14:10----------
like kind of the metaphor of and this is


---------14:13----------
in my 2017 or 18 of I metaphorically


---------14:17----------
killed myself Zach and I became asmin


---------14:20----------
gold right and I focused entirely on my


---------14:22----------
stream and I stopped dealing with you


---------14:25----------
know the people and and everything like


---------14:27----------
that and coming back I've wanted to be


---------14:30----------
more of who I am really and I think


---------14:34----------
that's been something I've been working


---------14:35----------
on but it's hard to do that whenever


---------14:37----------
screaming can be very stressful it's a


---------14:40----------
very emotionally draining job sometimes


---------14:42----------
and it's sometimes I do feel like kind


---------14:46----------
of after I finished my stream I just


---------14:49----------
want to sit there by myself even though


---------14:52----------
that's not necessarily what I should do


---------14:54----------
I think that twice sure to delete why


---------14:56----------
should you do that well because I feel


---------14:59----------
like it's kind of like what I was saying


---------15:02----------
a minute ago


---------15:03----------
whenever I was talking about how


---------15:04----------
whenever I would see someone or talk to


---------15:07----------
someone and do the thing that I was like


---------15:09----------
kind of putting off doing and I would


---------15:11----------
actually do it I would feel better at


---------15:13----------
the end but the anticipation and like


---------15:15----------
kind of the the wanting to do it or not


---------15:18----------
wanting to do it overwhelmed that and so


---------15:20----------
you I was basically prolonging a


---------15:22----------
negative feeling and preventing a


---------15:24----------
positive feeling sure that's always been


---------15:26----------
like a big problem that I've had like


---------15:29----------
with schoolwork


---------15:30----------
with everything yes oh yeah let me just


---------15:34----------
see if I kind of cuz I think there's you


---------15:35----------
know Zack there's a lot every time you


---------15:39----------
speak there's actually a lot there and


---------15:41----------
so let me try to unpack a little bit


---------15:43----------
about what I heard and maybe how we can


---------15:45----------
focus things are you feeling okay I'm


---------15:47----------
feeling great okay so the first is that


---------15:53----------
you said something around a failure to


---------15:54----------
commit and what I'm gonna kind of zero


---------15:58----------
that in on is like how can we understand


---------16:00----------
what is laziness like what is laziness


---------16:03----------
where does it come from


---------16:05----------
another thing is sort of this idea of


---------16:08----------
like failure to respond so that you have


---------16:10----------
certain duties or things that you should


---------16:12----------
do right so let's talk a talk about it


---------16:15----------
as the problem of should right yeah and


---------16:18----------
it's kind of like I should do this and


---------16:20----------
like you know that something is good for


---------16:21----------
you but you can't seem to do it and so


---------16:24----------
how the [ __ ] does that like you know


---------16:25----------
it's gonna be good for you you know


---------16:27----------
you're gonna feel better and then you


---------16:29----------
have like you have two options in your


---------16:30----------
mind right you can prolong negativity or


---------16:32----------
we can let go of negativity and become


---------16:34----------
positive and it's like why on earth


---------16:37----------
would you never pick prolonging


---------16:39----------
negativity well the problem with me is I


---------16:42----------
go for a third option where I ignore the


---------16:45----------
negativity I pretend the problem isn't


---------16:47----------
real and I just go on my day and I'm


---------16:50----------
like hey this is great I'm happy and


---------16:52----------
I'll might do it tomorrow or the next


---------16:54----------
day or you know I'll do it at some point


---------16:56----------
in the future and this never really


---------16:58----------
happens since that you know I put things


---------17:01----------
off for like a year yeah so like like


---------17:05----------
it's almost like a willful distraction


---------17:07----------
oh you're not really interacting myself


---------17:10----------
yeah so how does that work and then the


---------17:13----------
third sort of theme that I'm hearing is


---------17:16----------
something around burnout in the war


---------17:18----------
between Zack and asmin gold which like


---------17:23----------
that that topic I'm happy to talk about


---------17:25----------
but we like literally talked about that


---------17:27----------
on Wednesday with this guy named Jake


---------17:29----------
and baked and we talked about the war


---------17:32----------
between Jake and Jake and bake oh I I


---------17:35----------
think that you'll have that conversation


---------17:36----------
with every streamer I have had that


---------17:38----------
Congress with every streamer so so I


---------17:41----------
feel like that one is sort of I'm happy


---------17:43----------
to have it again because I


---------17:44----------
think it's fascinating and we can sort


---------17:46----------
of you know zero in on different nuances


---------17:48----------
and and try to understand what's unique


---------17:50----------
to someone and what's common but I think


---------17:53----------
that maybe there's a little bit more


---------17:55----------
mileage to be gained over this idea of


---------17:57----------
laziness in this like failure to respond


---------18:00----------
willful distraction like those are the


---------18:03----------
two buckets that I think could be you


---------18:06----------
know I could try to tackle with you


---------18:07----------
let's do something different


---------18:09----------
okay so what do you want to what you


---------18:12----------
want to talk about laziness or you want


---------18:13----------
to talk about the willful distraction ah


---------18:15----------
I think that they're kind of both things


---------18:18----------
oh yeah I get that they're connected so


---------18:20----------
like let's pick a direction


---------18:22----------
um I think probably just laziness


---------18:26----------
because London as I said I'm I'm


---------18:29----------
generally a Content person it's very


---------18:31----------
easy for me to be content with things


---------18:33----------
whether they're great or bad and I am


---------18:37----------
you know I am what I am and so I don't I


---------18:41----------
I don't really worry about doing a lot


---------18:44----------
of things I guess it's kind of weird I


---------18:46----------
can I'm very good at just forgetting


---------18:47----------
problems and just not thinking about


---------18:49----------
them sure so you you sound you seem to


---------18:53----------
me to be happy Zack are you happy yes


---------18:55----------
sometimes I'm not always happy there are


---------18:58----------
a lot of things that make me very sad


---------18:59----------
but there are yeah I'd say overall I


---------19:03----------
wake up in the morning and yeah so let


---------19:08----------
me rephrase so I think happiness and


---------19:10----------
sadness are emotions


---------19:11----------
yeah I guess what I'm talking about is


---------19:14----------
like so happiness can sometimes be


---------19:16----------
referred to is like an existential thing


---------19:18----------
or an emotional thing


---------19:20----------
I get the sense just listening to you


---------19:22----------
that your eggs essentially healthy even


---------19:24----------
though you may not be emotionally happy


---------19:26----------
at times I am until I think about dying


---------19:29----------
then yes I would be the only thing oh


---------19:33----------
yeah I think about it a lot what do you


---------19:36----------
think about dying oh that's that's it's


---------19:39----------
a bad time what's bad about


---------19:44----------
well there are two things that can


---------19:48----------
either happen


---------19:49----------
you can either exist forever in eternity


---------19:54----------
or you cannot exist forever


---------19:57----------
and I think both of them are equally


---------19:59----------
terrifying what's terrifying about them


---------20:03----------
the human mind cannot process infinity


---------20:07----------
you can't understand what infinity is or


---------20:11----------
at least I can't and the uncertainty of


---------20:16----------
it because I've thought about this a lot


---------20:18----------
and I've thought to myself I used to be


---------20:21----------
very very afraid of this and it doesn't


---------20:22----------
matter what happens it doesn't matter


---------20:24----------
what you do it doesn't matter what you


---------20:26----------
can do you can be mother Teresa Adolf


---------20:28----------
Hitler or you still end up in the ground


---------20:29----------
and there's no running from it or hiding


---------20:32----------
from it or anything and I don't know


---------20:35----------
exactly how I never really knew exactly


---------20:40----------
how to understand that and I thought to


---------20:42----------
myself I was like well if God would come


---------20:44----------
down and tell me you know hey I'm real


---------20:48----------
all this [ __ ] that you read in that book


---------20:50----------
that's a hundred percent true and you're


---------20:53----------
gonna be you're gonna be just fine


---------20:54----------
would that make me feel good well I


---------20:58----------
thought about that for a long time and I


---------20:59----------
thought yeah it would and then after a


---------21:02----------
few years about thinking about that


---------21:04----------
maybe five or ten years thinking about


---------21:06----------
that I thought wouldn't that also be


---------21:08----------
kind of scary because that means that


---------21:10----------
your entire existence is premeditated do


---------21:14----------
you really exist if you're a construct


---------21:17----------
of somebody else's goals they said I'm


---------21:20----------
saying yeah I see what you're saying


---------21:22----------
just give me a second okay


---------21:31----------
so what's scary about not existing for


---------21:34----------
eternity I don't know it's a weird thing


---------21:41----------
because every once in a while I'll I'll


---------21:44----------
get to the point of you know I don't


---------21:47----------
know I can lighten meant where I'm not


---------21:49----------
bothered by that but also there are


---------21:51----------
times where I'll lay in bed and be


---------21:53----------
terrified and the only thing that I can


---------21:55----------
ever do to really reassure myself is to


---------21:58----------
remind myself that I am a hyper


---------22:00----------
intelligent monkey that doesn't really


---------22:02----------
know what's going on with the world


---------22:03----------
that's the only way I can ever ever make


---------22:07----------
myself feel good about it okay remind


---------22:09----------
myself I don't know I'm gonna toss out a


---------22:12----------
third bucket and I think this bucket is


---------22:14----------
probably the lowest yield bucket but


---------22:16----------
maybe you know maybe somewhat


---------22:18----------
interesting and that's like what's the


---------22:20----------
deal with death so you know I think this


---------22:25----------
is tricky because like generally


---------22:26----------
speaking I I have a particular so I


---------22:30----------
think about it as a Padma a duty so I


---------22:33----------
think about having like a duty to the


---------22:35----------
person that I speak to and I just try to


---------22:37----------
think about you know every time I stream


---------22:38----------
so there's also all oak and dr. K right


---------22:41----------
like so I have that struggle too and I


---------22:43----------
the way the simple way that I get rid of


---------22:44----------
that struggle is I think a little bit


---------22:46----------
about like I just think about okay what


---------22:47----------
is all oak doing what does dr. K do dr.


---------22:50----------
K streams to like you know thousands of


---------22:51----------
people and tries to do a Oh a healing


---------22:53----------
and all that kind of good stuff which is


---------22:54----------
fine and great and Noble and fantastic


---------22:57----------
and all that kind of stuff but all it


---------22:59----------
just tries to help like just random


---------23:00----------
people that he talks to and anytime I


---------23:02----------
talk to someone I just think about what


---------23:03----------
can I do for this person mm-hmm now I'm


---------23:06----------
I'm running into a little bit of a


---------23:08----------
problem because all oak and dr. K are


---------23:09----------
fighting right now and what all oak says


---------23:11----------
is that I would love to talk to you


---------23:13----------
about death in the nature of existence


---------23:14----------
and and what happens after we die and to


---------23:18----------
give you a sense of give you a road or a


---------23:20----------
road map to finding peace around this


---------23:22----------
issue and then dr. K says that I don't


---------23:26----------
know how applicable this is going to be


---------23:27----------
a lot of the people watching or probably


---------23:29----------
struggling with laziness and having a


---------23:32----------
multidisciplinary understanding of


---------23:34----------
laziness in terms of spirituality the


---------23:36----------
function of the mind yoga meditation


---------23:38----------
psychology neuroscience and like sort of


---------23:41----------
be like the science of behavior is


---------23:44----------
probably gonna help more people because


---------23:46----------
like that's people are lazy I here's how


---------23:50----------
I look at it go for I'm a very pragmatic


---------23:52----------
person uh-huh and there have been many


---------23:56----------
philosophers over the thousands of years


---------23:59----------
Jesus Buddha Confucius Nietzsche and you


---------24:03----------
know all these people who tried to


---------24:05----------
explain and you know philosophize about


---------24:07----------
death I don't think we're gonna get any


---------24:10----------
farther in this call well yes I mean I


---------24:13----------
completely agree with you but I think


---------24:15----------
the reason that we're not gonna you


---------24:17----------
haven't you don't think we're gonna get


---------24:18----------
anywhere in this call is because you


---------24:20----------
think what does a philosopher I think


---------24:22----------
the reason that you don't have answers


---------24:24----------
is because you're looking for them in


---------24:25----------
the wrong places


---------24:26----------
really where do you think I should look


---------24:29----------
so let's think about this for a second


---------24:31----------
where does knowledge come from


---------24:34----------
experience okay so how many


---------24:38----------
conversations can you have how many


---------24:42----------
people do I have to talk to about having


---------24:45----------
sex before I understand what it's like


---------24:47----------
to have sex it depends on what they tell


---------24:52----------
you so like let's okay so like you know


---------24:56----------
what could they tell me that wouldn't


---------24:58----------
help me understand what having sex is


---------25:02----------
like like how many people could I talk


---------25:04----------
to uh well I mean I I think that I I


---------25:08----------
don't know I mean I think that you're


---------25:11----------
implying that you have to see it


---------25:12----------
yourself is that right no I mean so


---------25:15----------
you're the one who said that that I


---------25:16----------
asked you where does knowledge come from


---------25:18----------
and you said experience and so then my


---------25:20----------
response was like okay how many people


---------25:24----------
do I have to talk to to understand what


---------25:25----------
sex is


---------25:26----------
uh well I mean I think it depends right


---------25:30----------
I mean you're gonna have first-hand


---------25:31----------
experience of actually doing it yourself


---------25:33----------
and that's very direct knowledge and


---------25:35----------
then you'll have second hand experience


---------25:37----------
what a second experience mean there's


---------25:39----------
somebody telling you like a man I hooked


---------25:41----------
up with this girl and it was great you


---------25:42----------
know and this is what happened is that


---------25:44----------
experience uh yeah I mean I guess yeah


---------25:49----------
is it not do you think that it's not no


---------25:52----------
I wouldn't call it experience I'd call


---------25:53----------
it words


---------25:56----------
right so Sanskrit has two words for


---------25:59----------
knowledge one is Vidya Vidya is


---------26:03----------
objective transmissible and also like


---------26:07----------
information another word for knowledge


---------26:10----------
is neon which is subjective experience


---------26:13----------
all and non transmissible yeah okay yeah


---------26:19----------
that makes a lot of sense so first-hand


---------26:21----------
experiences neon secondhand experiences


---------26:24----------
you call it is Vidya it's something that


---------26:27----------
can be exchanged between two human


---------26:28----------
beings do you feel like the two of those


---------26:31----------
one of them is more visceral than the


---------26:33----------
other absolutely because one of them is


---------26:35----------
subjective and one of them is subjective


---------26:37----------
one of them is completely visceral and


---------26:40----------
the other one is not visceral at all


---------26:42----------
yeah right I understand that so so


---------26:46----------
you've been grappling with the problem


---------26:47----------
of death for a long time and have you


---------26:49----------
been approaching it from video from Jung


---------26:52----------
I've tried to do both okay so tell us


---------26:56----------
about that um well I've I've considered


---------27:01----------
like reading different like you know


---------27:04----------
what do you call it like different like


---------27:06----------
holy books right I've thought about I've


---------27:08----------
always been that ready yeah


---------27:10----------
do you need a refresher on the


---------27:13----------
definitions well I mean I guess you


---------27:16----------
can't I mean I've never died yeah I


---------27:19----------
think sleeping is the closest thing that


---------27:20----------
you have today sure and I've always kind


---------27:22----------
of used that is a little bit of a you


---------27:24----------
know a smaller metaphor of that and in a


---------27:26----------
way I guess you could say that I have


---------27:29----------
had experience because before 1990 I did


---------27:32----------
not exist okay yeah yeah hey so yeah so


---------27:40----------
okay so let's think about this for a


---------27:46----------
second do you do you fear what you were


---------27:50----------
before 1990 I've done this one myself no


---------28:00----------
not really no I don't then why do I hear


---------28:03----------
what happens after you die because what


---------28:08----------
happened after 1990 didn't happen before


---------28:10----------
I never had the experience that I had I


---------28:13----------
never had the the friends I had I never


---------28:15----------
had the emotions I had I never had the


---------28:19----------
the yeah experiences and okay then yeah


---------28:23----------
everything so so so then then we can see


---------28:25----------
so that's a subtle but important point


---------28:27----------
right because then what we're talking


---------28:29----------
about is that your attachment or your


---------28:32----------
avoidance of death is out of an


---------28:34----------
attachment of life that you're really


---------28:37----------
you're really your only complaint with


---------28:38----------
before 1990 is that you didn't have the


---------28:40----------
[ __ ] that you have now ergo what you


---------28:44----------
what you want to avoid is you don't want


---------28:47----------
to lose what you have net no I don't so


---------28:53----------
that's so if we think about so then it's


---------28:55----------
sort of like it's sort of immaterial and


---------28:57----------
now it sort of makes sense right because


---------28:59----------
you kind of said if there's life after


---------29:01----------
death and there's eternity of


---------29:03----------
consciousness then that's scary and if


---------29:06----------
there isn't consciousness that's equally


---------29:07----------
scary therefore we can conclude that


---------29:10----------
like what you're afraid of has nothing


---------29:12----------
to do with whether you exist or not


---------29:14----------
after you've done what you're afraid of


---------29:17----------
good right because the bumps that those


---------29:20----------
options create the same reaction to you


---------29:21----------
it's all the same whether your life ever


---------29:25----------
after I've decided which one is more


---------29:27----------
terrifying yet yeah but they're both


---------29:28----------
terrifying


---------29:29----------
so like therefore we can conclude


---------29:30----------
logically that like the terror doesn't


---------29:33----------
come from either of those things because


---------29:34----------
that doesn't make any sense


---------29:37----------
mm-hmm so then then and we hear and what


---------29:41----------
you said it's just consistent with your


---------29:42----------
earlier feeling right which is that what


---------29:45----------
you're afraid of is the loss of what you


---------29:47----------
have it's an attachment it's not about


---------29:49----------
like what happens to you after you die


---------29:51----------
it's not like about your consciousness


---------29:53----------
it's the lack of the experiences that


---------29:55----------
you have today that you're afraid of


---------29:57----------
yeah and I I did a thought experiment


---------30:00----------
with this and I thought about this a lot


---------30:02----------
what would happen you know how would I


---------30:03----------
feel if basically whenever you died your


---------30:05----------
soul was effectively recycled and all of


---------30:08----------
your experiences were wiped and you just


---------30:10----------
did it all over again and I still don't


---------30:12----------
really know how I feel about that yeah


---------30:14----------
because your what is a thought


---------30:16----------
experiment is it been the early on I


---------30:21----------
think it's


---------30:22----------
on attempting to be Vidya its Vidya


---------30:25----------
attempting to manana


---------30:26----------
oh I must have gotten them yes I forgot


---------30:29----------
I'm confused right so so it's it's like


---------30:32----------
it's thinking your way it's like it's


---------30:34----------
like a thought experiment about sex is


---------30:36----------
not an orgasm so like like you can think


---------30:43----------
you're wet and this is why I think you


---------30:44----------
don't think that the conversation is


---------30:46----------
going to be productive because you're


---------30:47----------
thinking that the answers are gonna come


---------30:48----------
from the conversation the answers aren't


---------30:50----------
can come from the conversation all the


---------30:51----------
conversation is gonna do hopefully is


---------30:54----------
give you a roadmap to experience because


---------30:57----------
I don't think you know how to do that um


---------31:01----------
no maybe not yeah so then I guess this


---------31:06----------
is what we're talking about you want to


---------31:07----------
go back to laziness we wanted to do this


---------31:08----------
uh I think that we can do this maybe a


---------31:12----------
couple more minutes and then we can go


---------31:13----------
back to laziness I'm okay so let me a


---------31:16----------
couple more minutes oh okay yeah let's


---------31:19----------
see what we can do so so let me let's


---------31:21----------
start by sort of saying that like do you


---------31:23----------
do you follow me that I think that your


---------31:26----------
your fear of death is is not a fear of


---------31:30----------
what's beyond it's a fear of loss of


---------31:33----------
what you have now it's a fear of the


---------31:36----------
loss of life so much so that I actually


---------31:39----------
I I whenever I was very young I began


---------31:42----------
recording a lot of the things that I did


---------31:45----------
whenever I was a kid and I want a video


---------31:48----------
camera whenever I was 11 years old


---------31:50----------
because I had the foresight then I


---------31:51----------
realized that you know I thought to


---------31:53----------
myself I can't really remember what


---------31:54----------
happened whenever I was 6 but I always


---------31:56----------
want to be able to preserve and keep the


---------31:58----------
memories that I had and I've always done


---------32:01----------
that so I would never forget yes so


---------32:04----------
you're holding on to life absolutely


---------32:07----------
right and so then if you want to conquer


---------32:11----------
your fear of death I notice it sounds


---------32:13----------
[ __ ] like a meditation calendar but


---------32:16----------
what you really have to do is let go of


---------32:17----------
your attachment of life that's no saying


---------32:21----------
about the moments of enlightenment yeah


---------32:23----------
so so now let's talk about that like


---------32:25----------
what does that even mean a moment of


---------32:27----------
enlightenment what does that mean when


---------32:30----------
you confront things that you're


---------32:31----------
completely afraid of but for whatever


---------32:33----------
reason you're not afraid of them you you


---------32:36----------
look at


---------32:36----------
the you look at death in the face you


---------32:39----------
look it for me a dentists or wasps these


---------32:42----------
are two things I'm very afraid of and


---------32:45----------
you know you look at that and you just


---------32:48----------
do it and you you approach it and you I


---------32:53----------
don't know like really what the best


---------32:55----------
word is for it but yeah I don't think


---------32:59----------
internalize is it but you let it become


---------33:01----------
part of you and you accept it as a


---------33:03----------
reality that's okay to be the best way I


---------33:05----------
could verbalize it yeah so so then let


---------33:07----------
me ask you let's ask some questions


---------33:09----------
about the quality of moments of


---------33:11----------
enlightenment so you say they're moments


---------33:13----------
ergo it's not permanent right yeah so


---------33:15----------
what fluctuates between a moment of


---------33:19----------
enlightenment in a moment of not


---------33:21----------
enlightened uh I I don't really know


---------33:26----------
because the weird thing about the


---------33:28----------
moments of enlightenment is that


---------33:29----------
sometimes I'll feel that way whenever


---------33:31----------
things are going very well and I'm happy


---------33:34----------
and other times I'll feel that way where


---------33:36----------
I don't care about dying or anything


---------33:37----------
like that whenever things are going very


---------33:39----------
not well and I think that's really kind


---------33:41----------
of interesting because both ends you


---------33:43----------
know the both ends of the horse-shoe


---------33:45----------
meet at the same place nearly and I


---------33:47----------
think that's what happens okay excellent


---------33:50----------
so that's a very important observation


---------33:52----------
that the current state of emotions does


---------33:56----------
not affect the moment of enlightenment


---------33:58----------
and in fact the beauty of the moment of


---------34:00----------
enlightenment is that allows you to


---------34:03----------
experience both of those extremes with a


---------34:06----------
certain tranquility yes right so like


---------34:10----------
that's pretty cool so now we can think


---------34:13----------
about a couple of things so the first


---------34:14----------
thing that we figured out about moments


---------34:15----------
of enlightenment is that they fluctuate


---------34:17----------
it's not a permanent state it's not like


---------34:20----------
you know when you're leveling up and Wow


---------34:22----------
like once you hit level 14 you're no


---------34:24----------
longer Bumble 14 right you're never


---------34:27----------
gonna be level 13 again we think about


---------34:29----------
life is sort of a linear progression is


---------34:34----------
it not well there are moments of


---------34:37----------
enlightenment linear progression a


---------34:45----------
it's more or less an acceptance and a


---------34:50----------
just a complete acceptance of the linear


---------34:52----------
progression III think more so


---------34:55----------
okay so I'll unpack what that means in a


---------34:59----------
second but like like let me just point


---------35:00----------
out to you that like even in your words


---------35:03----------
right you call it a moment of


---------35:05----------
enlightenment it doesn't imply a linear


---------35:07----------
progression it implies temporary because


---------35:09----------
it's a moment oh yeah right so so the


---------35:13----------
first thing that we can understand about


---------35:15----------
moments of enlightenment is that they


---------35:16----------
fluctuate so it's not like you level up


---------35:19----------
and then you're more enlightened than


---------35:20----------
you were the day before it's not a


---------35:23----------
permanent game it's a fluctuates of


---------35:25----------
consciousness I do feel like learning


---------35:29----------
more things and having more experiences


---------35:31----------
and thinking more does help me have them


---------35:33----------
more often them but there's a very


---------35:39----------
important subtlety there right okay you


---------35:41----------
can level up your capacity to some of


---------35:44----------
them more often but they in themselves


---------35:47----------
are not permanent that's a big


---------35:49----------
difference you can level up your ability


---------35:52----------
you can level up your odds to have a


---------35:55----------
moment of enlightenment but the moment


---------35:57----------
of enlightenment is not something that


---------35:59----------
you can level up no it's it's it's


---------36:07----------
perfect yeah and then it goes right so


---------36:11----------
like like what we're talking about is


---------36:12----------
increasing the odds but we're not


---------36:14----------
talking like there's a big difference


---------36:15----------
between you know it's like how can I say


---------36:20----------
this okay so like in wow we've got


---------36:26----------
different colors of loot right yeah and


---------36:29----------
and so like at the end of the day like a


---------36:31----------
treasure chest has a certain like loot


---------36:34----------
table and so we can level up the quality


---------36:38----------
of our treasure chest just because we


---------36:41----------
are getting a high quality loot doesn't


---------36:43----------
mean that we're gonna get a high quality


---------36:44----------
loot next time it's like each treasure


---------36:47----------
chest is its own roll of the dice each


---------36:49----------
moment of enlightenment is a temporary


---------36:52----------
thing that has a one-time result you


---------36:54----------
have that moment of enlightenment or you


---------36:55----------
don't have that moment


---------36:56----------
right so I'm just pointing out that


---------36:59----------
there's a fluctuant there that's not


---------37:00----------
linear a flexion so it's not linear


---------37:05----------
right so it's not like a moment of


---------37:08----------
enlightenment it's not like you left up


---------37:09----------
and then you're enlightened more you can


---------37:11----------
level up to increase the quality of


---------37:13----------
chests that you get but at the end of


---------37:15----------
the day whether you get the moment of


---------37:17----------
enlightenment or not is still like a


---------37:19----------
variable like it's not yeah you don't


---------37:23----------
you well you don't have it all the time


---------37:25----------
yeah I think this is something that I


---------37:28----------
remember I think that it was like yeah I


---------37:33----------
think somebody has like Mother Teresa or


---------37:35----------
somebody like that what they what they


---------37:37----------
pray for and they said prayed for faith


---------37:40----------
and it was kind of a weird answer to me


---------37:43----------
because you'd assume that somebody who


---------37:45----------
is such a devoted you know servant of


---------37:48----------
God would not need to worry about that


---------37:50----------
no but even the most desert devoted


---------37:53----------
servants still also pray for faith yeah


---------37:57----------
is that kind of what you're saying


---------37:58----------
absolutely right so because I think of


---------38:00----------
faith what they talk about so here's


---------38:02----------
what I think a moment of enlightenment


---------38:03----------
and then is I'll sort of give you and


---------38:05----------
now I'm gonna give you a paradigm


---------38:06----------
instead of asking questions you're


---------38:08----------
welcome to attack or poke holes in it


---------38:10----------
okay so movements of enlightenment or


---------38:12----------
fluctuations of consciousness and


---------38:14----------
consciousness fluctuates right like we


---------38:16----------
know that consciousness you have


---------38:17----------
sleeping and you have waking and then


---------38:20----------
even in waking consciousness you have


---------38:22----------
different modes you have lazy


---------38:23----------
consciousness and you have non lazy


---------38:26----------
consciousness and the frustrating for a


---------38:29----------
lot of lazy people is that they're able


---------38:32----------
to do the right thing sometimes but then


---------38:35----------
we have the perception of linearly


---------38:37----------
levelling up and then they wake up the


---------38:39----------
next day and they're not able to clean


---------38:41----------
their room the way they were the day


---------38:42----------
before and they're like how the [ __ ]


---------38:43----------
does that woman because I could do it


---------38:45----------
yesterday I should be able to do it


---------38:46----------
today but no that's not how it works


---------38:48----------
because it's not linear it's just the


---------38:50----------
state of your consciousness at a


---------38:52----------
particular time allows you to do things


---------38:54----------
or not do things like sometimes if you


---------38:57----------
run away from the dentist and sometimes


---------38:59----------
you face the dentist and the interesting


---------39:01----------
thing is that you would assume logically


---------39:03----------
that like they're in the moments that


---------39:05----------
you face your dentists your fear is


---------39:07----------
lower and because your fears


---------39:09----------
that's why you're able to face them we


---------39:12----------
actually look at the data that's not


---------39:14----------
true your fear is always the same


---------39:16----------
sometimes you're able to conquer your


---------39:19----------
fear in other times you're not right


---------39:22----------
okay and so what's happening is that the


---------39:24----------
state like it's like now like it's not


---------39:29----------
that we level up our character it's that


---------39:32----------
like the controller that we're using


---------39:33----------
sometimes works really well and has


---------39:36----------
really tight controls and does what you


---------39:38----------
want it to and sometimes the controller


---------39:40----------
you're using is unplugged and when the


---------39:42----------
controller unplug is functional


---------39:44----------
controllers it's a really dysfunctional


---------39:45----------
control your character is the same but


---------39:48----------
like sometimes you can activate your


---------39:49----------
character and sometimes you can't


---------39:51----------
activate your character yeah sometimes


---------39:55----------
you can be you can overcome things and


---------39:57----------
sometimes you can I think that dichotomy


---------39:59----------
of instead of trying to lower your fear


---------40:01----------
you're effectively making your


---------40:03----------
controller better is that kind of what


---------40:05----------
you're saying yes right so what I'm


---------40:07----------
saying so like I'm just I'm trying to


---------40:09----------
point out to you that you say that you


---------40:10----------
have these moments of enlightenment and


---------40:12----------
like it's weird right because you're


---------40:13----------
saying they can happy happen when I'm


---------40:15----------
sad and when I'm gonna be and that's


---------40:18----------
like an odd thing odd observation but


---------40:20----------
let's not let our preconceptions shape


---------40:24----------
the data let's accept our data for what


---------40:27----------
it is and change our notion of how the


---------40:29----------
world works so moments of enlightenment


---------40:32----------
are independent of happiness and sadness


---------40:34----------
moments of enlightenment or temporary


---------40:36----------
there are things that you can do to


---------40:39----------
cultivate the occurrence or moments of


---------40:43----------
enlightenment which you can't ever make


---------40:46----------
them


---------40:46----------
you can't ever guarantee them I am all


---------40:51----------
too familiar with that getting loot in


---------40:53----------
World of Warcraft yep absolutely right


---------40:55----------
fundamental understanding come on yes


---------40:57----------
yes so you can set yourself up to get


---------41:01----------
whatever you know illidan's war glaives


---------41:03----------
or whatever that that first orange loot


---------41:06----------
was before weeks but there's nothing you


---------41:10----------
can do to like like you can set yourself


---------41:12----------
up to get that drunk don't like at the


---------41:14----------
end of the day there's a certain amount


---------41:16----------
of rnjesus involved and that's how


---------41:19----------
moments of enlightenment work right at


---------41:21----------
the end of the day you can't ever


---------41:22----------
8:1 so now the question becomes okay


---------41:26----------
hold on let me think about this so now


---------41:29----------
where do we go from here okay we were


---------41:30----------
talking about death you with me so far


---------41:32----------
oh absolutely okay so now I'm gonna hold


---------41:39----------
on let me just think


---------41:42----------
Oh huh hello okay don't yell okay all


---------41:55----------
right all right all right


---------41:59----------
apparently I'm destroying people to here


---------42:01----------
drive I guess I decided to yeah


---------42:03----------
apologize guys for you know destroying


---------42:05----------
your eardrums okay let me think about


---------42:06----------
this okay so now we figured out a couple


---------42:09----------
of moment actually beat some moments of


---------42:11----------
enlightenment right okay so then we were


---------42:15----------
also talking about laziness we were


---------42:17----------
talking about the fear of death do you


---------42:21----------
want to know what's weird is that I


---------42:22----------
think the moments of enlightenment and


---------42:25----------
enable the laziness tell me about that


---------42:29----------
well I mean I think that fundamentally


---------42:32----------
the understanding of you know kind of


---------42:35----------
eternity and infinity makes the current


---------42:39----------
problems that you have seem less


---------42:40----------
important


---------42:45----------
I think that really matter anyway you


---------42:47----------
know what I mean yes I think that the


---------42:50----------
moments of enlightenment this is subtle


---------42:52----------
I don't think the moments of


---------42:54----------
enlightenment actually encourage


---------42:55----------
laziness I think the moments of


---------42:58----------
enlightenment are hijacked by the part


---------43:02----------
of you that is lazy to justify its own


---------43:04----------
ends because during the moment of


---------43:08----------
enlightenment your laziness actually


---------43:10----------
decreases drastically what happens is


---------43:12----------
when the the laziness returns to your


---------43:14----------
mind it takes the experience of the


---------43:18----------
moment of enlightenment and it uses it


---------43:20----------
for its own ends I progressed


---------43:25----------
so it's a subtle difference but it's


---------43:27----------
very important so when you actually are


---------43:30----------
in a moment of enlightenment you're the


---------43:32----------
very opposite of wasy


---------43:34----------
yeah you're not controlled by your


---------43:36----------
emotions you don't seek distraction and


---------43:38----------
then what happens is the lazy [ __ ]


---------43:41----------
slides back in and he's like hey you


---------43:42----------
remember how you were enlightened


---------43:43----------
earlier if you were enlightened earlier


---------43:46----------
like we don't need to worry about


---------43:47----------
anything bro yeah yeah everything's


---------43:49----------
gonna be fine dude just don't just don't


---------43:51----------
worry about it it is what it is exactly


---------43:54----------
so but now let's think about it don't


---------43:56----------
worry about it bro


---------43:57----------
is that a thought that comes from the


---------44:00----------
moment of enlightenment or something


---------44:02----------
that it isn't the moment of


---------44:03----------
enlightenment I don't know that's a


---------44:07----------
really interesting question do you think


---------44:08----------
that it doesn't yes so I think that the


---------44:11----------
moment of enlightenment has a very


---------44:16----------
similar thought but in a completely


---------44:18----------
opposite direction so there's a huge


---------44:21----------
difference between apathy and detachment


---------44:23----------
so the moment in the moment of


---------44:26----------
enlightenment you can acknowledge that


---------44:28----------
things are as they are and you cannot


---------44:31----------
control them and that's okay and yet let


---------44:34----------
us and let us not be concerned about the


---------44:37----------
future let us do the thing that we need


---------44:38----------
to do now and there's a very very smooth


---------44:42----------
there's just a Razors Edge between


---------44:45----------
detachment which is letting go of the


---------44:48----------
consequences of your actions


---------44:50----------
not concerning yourself or being


---------44:52----------
controlled by the future and accepting


---------44:55----------
fully what is in the present there's a


---------44:58----------
there's


---------44:58----------
just a razor judge between them and


---------45:01----------
apathy which is the future doesn't mean


---------45:03----------
yeah the nihilism of good yep right so


---------45:07----------
it's it's a very subtle difference but


---------45:09----------
it's like it's soft but it's gigantic


---------45:12----------
it's the difference between what I would


---------45:14----------
call detachment which is Vairagya in


---------45:16----------
sanskrit and apathy III actually I


---------45:20----------
really like I like that a lot I I agree


---------45:23----------
I think that growing up I was just very


---------45:26----------
used to just detaching myself from


---------45:28----------
things and you know accepting things for


---------45:31----------
how they are and because of that I don't


---------45:34----------
really it's hard for me really to


---------45:36----------
motivate myself to do something because


---------45:38----------
I can just very easily not care about it


---------45:41----------
so there is a difference so I think


---------45:43----------
you're doing both I think growing up you


---------45:45----------
did both so there's a difference between


---------45:48----------
not caring right so like just think


---------45:50----------
about this so there's a difference


---------45:52----------
between not caring and and appreciating


---------45:56----------
what you need so I think when you were


---------45:59----------
growing up I do think you had moments of


---------46:01----------
enlightenment that's why I think you


---------46:02----------
grew you were a hippie despite being


---------46:04----------
poor because at the end of the day that


---------46:06----------
you know the end of the day what I did


---------46:08----------
for both the guy in jail and the


---------46:10----------
investment banker is teaching them


---------46:11----------
detachment and both of them got happier


---------46:13----------
has nothing to do with your external


---------46:15----------
circumstance yes oh I think what you


---------46:17----------
were able to do growing up is like wreck


---------46:19----------
like appreciate your life for what it


---------46:21----------
was even though it may not have been


---------46:23----------
good right there's a difference between


---------46:26----------
appreciating it for what it is and not


---------46:28----------
caring about it okay I think your not


---------46:34----------
caring is laziness appreciation and


---------46:38----------
acknowledging it for what it is is the


---------46:40----------
moment of enlightenment yeah I I I think


---------46:47----------
that is definitely a razor's edge and


---------46:49----------
it's like enlightenment versus nihilism


---------46:53----------
and oftentimes it's you know it's really


---------46:57----------
just making those moments of


---------46:59----------
enlightenment and everything making them


---------47:01----------
fundamentally more healthy in a moment


---------47:05----------
enlightenment is is perfectly healthy


---------47:07----------
you can't make it more healthy but you


---------47:10----------
can make more healthy is the


---------47:12----------
laziness that uses the moment of


---------47:16----------
enlightenment as ammo for its own ends


---------47:17----------
all right yeah right so that's the


---------47:21----------
complex that you need to work on which


---------47:23----------
is like what is that type of mind that


---------47:26----------
takes your moments of enlightenment and


---------47:28----------
uses them in the opposite direction from


---------47:31----------
what your moment of enlightenment


---------47:32----------
actually does yeah I don't really know


---------47:39----------
what that is


---------47:40----------
yeah right yeah I don't really know I'm


---------47:42----------
not sure okay so let's talk about it so


---------47:44----------
now we get to laziness okay okay so


---------47:47----------
we've sort of navigated moments of


---------47:49----------
enlightenment I feel tempted to ask


---------47:51----------
people a poll because I have no idea if


---------47:52----------
people are following what we're saying


---------47:54----------
um but anyway we can just keep going


---------47:58----------
okay okay can I think most will be able


---------48:01----------
to relate to laziness yeah so let's talk


---------48:03----------
about laziness so now now I want okay so


---------48:05----------
okay people are saying yes okay fix mic


---------48:09----------
okay all right so now let's talk about


---------48:12----------
laziness okay so let's talk about so


---------48:14----------
Zack what I'd like to do is help you


---------48:16----------
understand that your mind is not a


---------48:18----------
monolith that your mind is actually like


---------48:21----------
a 40 man raid and each part of your ray


---------48:25----------
does like different things and sometimes


---------48:26----------
you're gonna get a Leroy Jenkins in


---------48:28----------
there the laziness is like the Leroy


---------48:30----------
Jenkins when it takes all the other 39


---------48:33----------
parts of your mind that are functioning


---------48:35----------
well and it says [ __ ] you guys we're


---------48:37----------
gonna go and then it puts your mind in a


---------48:40----------
situation where like you'll and that's


---------48:43----------
when you that's like Leroy Jenkins is


---------48:46----------
the reason that you can't get out of bed


---------48:47----------
and listen to your alarm clock for three


---------48:49----------
hours because there are all these other


---------48:50----------
parts of your mind Leroy Jenkins is also


---------48:53----------
the reason why you know that there's


---------48:55----------
something that you should do which is


---------48:56----------
gonna make you feel better but then you


---------48:58----------
choose not to do it and continue


---------48:59----------
existing in the negativity there's a


---------49:01----------
thousand voices in your mind that are


---------49:03----------
saying the sangguk get the [ __ ] out of


---------49:05----------
bed and there's Leroy Jenkins going then


---------49:10----------
he just charges right in and there's


---------49:12----------
like [ __ ] rusty you guys right that's


---------49:14----------
what your mind is that makes sense yeah


---------49:18----------
okay no that's that's true I mean I


---------49:20----------
think that yeah there's always an


---------49:22----------
internal struggle and the worst part


---------49:24----------
about it is that you know you're


---------49:26----------
doing it when you're doing it like you


---------49:28----------
know you're [ __ ] yourself up you're


---------49:30----------
sitting there on your computer not doing


---------49:33----------
the [ __ ] that you need to do not doing


---------49:35----------
the work that you need to do and you


---------49:37----------
know you're doing it and you keep doing


---------49:39----------
it yes so how the [ __ ] does that work


---------49:44----------
honestly the best way that I've ever


---------49:47----------
found to understand it is because it's


---------49:49----------
just simply easier not to do it I can


---------49:53----------
sit there and I am in as you know the


---------49:55----------
Isaac Newton you know yes so so that's


---------49:57----------
that's hmm and also a really


---------50:01----------
insufficient understanding right so like


---------50:03----------
let me put it I'm going to rephrase it


---------50:05----------
when you say it's easier to not do it


---------50:07----------
I'm gonna recalibrate that as your mind


---------50:12----------
has like a behavior equation and it has


---------50:17----------
reasons to engage in the behavior and


---------50:19----------
reasons to not engage in the behavior


---------50:21----------
and they're a bunch of variables for


---------50:23----------
that equation and when you say it's just


---------50:25----------
easier not to do it what I'm translating


---------50:27----------
as is at the end of the day the behavior


---------50:30----------
equation is tipping into the negative


---------50:32----------
and not doing there's like a really


---------50:35----------
complex calculation and we can think


---------50:37----------
about like using the Benham right so we


---------50:39----------
have like when do we engage in the


---------50:41----------
behavior of using the meter like when do


---------50:45----------
you go to the bathroom I mean like what


---------50:50----------
I need to write but are there times that


---------50:53----------
you need to go that you don't go uh-huh


---------50:56----------
yeah I mean like if I'm in the middle of


---------50:58----------
something I'll put it off until then


---------51:01----------
exactly right so we can see that using


---------51:03----------
the bathroom has two variables how how


---------51:06----------
available was the bathroom and how much


---------51:09----------
do I need to go and there may be times


---------51:11----------
where you go because even though you


---------51:13----------
don't need to go it's highly available


---------51:15----------
and there are other times where you


---------51:17----------
really need to go and it has low


---------51:18----------
availability so you don't go to the


---------51:20----------
bathroom you know over time if you think


---------51:22----------
about like even using the bathroom


---------51:24----------
there's like a little counter in your


---------51:25----------
mind that is slowly ticking up and as


---------51:28----------
this as your bladder fills up with urine


---------51:30----------
like it's kind of interesting right like


---------51:31----------
you don't how much you need to go to the


---------51:33----------
bathroom it's not like zero to a hundred


---------51:35----------
percent it's linear your bladder fills


---------51:37----------
up to the to a certain point and the


---------51:39----------
and it starts to stretch that's like I


---------51:42----------
need to pee I did the same thing with


---------51:45----------
filling up my car with gas like I'll


---------51:47----------
literally wait for the the light to come


---------51:50----------
on and then it's like that'll be the one


---------51:53----------
time that I have to be somewhere in


---------51:55----------
eight minutes and I'll have to get gas


---------51:58----------
so like now I'm gonna be late and it's


---------52:00----------
like I think to myself I'm like bro like


---------52:02----------
you could have done this like while you


---------52:03----------
were driving the wind ease yesterday


---------52:04----------
afternoon when you had nothing better to


---------52:06----------
do


---------52:06----------
yeah but one time I need to do that and


---------52:09----------
I it's not doing it I keep doing it and


---------52:15----------
it's just it's just like why don't you


---------52:17----------
pee every hour it's because your your


---------52:20----------
body is not signaling it's like once we


---------52:22----------
crossed the bladder stretch threshold


---------52:23----------
then it's time to be and what you


---------52:26----------
perceive is laziness is that your mental


---------52:28----------
bloom is not being stretched until it's


---------52:31----------
ready to stretch and this is sort of


---------52:34----------
like well we kind of operate between and


---------52:36----------
let me know if I lose you okay so like


---------52:38----------
generally speaking gamers operate on an


---------52:41----------
axis of desperation and complacency and


---------52:44----------
there's like you're complacent and then


---------52:47----------
you get desperate and then you're


---------52:48----------
prompted to action and then once your


---------52:51----------
desperation goes away like you look back


---------52:53----------
at yourself and you're like wow I


---------52:54----------
studied like 18 hours in 16 hours and


---------52:59----------
that was amazing and like I can't


---------53:01----------
believe my didn't and then you go back


---------53:02----------
to being lazy you're like back into the


---------53:04----------
complacency and then now I don't have to


---------53:07----------
do it anymore


---------53:07----------
exactly so then you're back to


---------53:08----------
complacent so then complacent complacent


---------53:10----------
complacent complacent complacent bladder


---------53:12----------
is filling up filling up filling up


---------53:14----------
filling up filling up stretch and then


---------53:16----------
it's like oh [ __ ] I got to do all this


---------53:19----------
[ __ ] now I could have done it all that


---------53:21----------
during during that time but that's not


---------53:22----------
how we work so we have this really


---------53:25----------
complicated behavioral mechanism in our


---------53:29----------
mind that prompts us to do things and


---------53:31----------
not do things and it is my belief that


---------53:33----------
is the it is the lack of understanding


---------53:35----------
of that behavioral mechanism which we


---------53:38----------
interpret is lateness I I like that a


---------53:44----------
lot I think that that's a very good


---------53:46----------
metaphor yes I think that's very good


---------53:48----------
now let's think a little bit let's dig


---------53:50----------
in right so tell me about laziness


---------53:53----------
what do you mean by that I mean having a


---------53:58----------
thing that I'm supposed to do and then


---------54:01----------
okay let's stop I okay what do you mean


---------54:04----------
by supposed to do something that needs


---------54:09----------
to happen so like for example does it


---------54:11----------
need to happen well that's the


---------54:15----------
conversation I have in my head and it's


---------54:17----------
like actually ah you know we'll see what


---------54:21----------
happens


---------54:21----------
right because I've had the worst part


---------54:23----------
about is I've had times where I just put


---------54:25----------
something off for so long it actually


---------54:27----------
went away like this has happened before


---------54:30----------
and so it's it's bad to have that happen


---------54:34----------
because it really it's bad to have that


---------54:37----------
so now now that's just right because


---------54:39----------
like I think the first thing you've got


---------54:41----------
to do is recognize that your perception


---------54:45----------
of the problem is not actually what your


---------54:47----------
brain sees is the problem and we didn't


---------54:49----------
even get to the problem said there are


---------54:51----------
things that I'm supposed to do hold on


---------54:52----------
stop for a second what do you mean I


---------54:53----------
supposed because your brain is like bro


---------54:56----------
why the [ __ ] do you need to clean your


---------54:58----------
room it doesn't make a difference like


---------54:59----------
your brain is not gonna let you walk


---------55:01----------
five miles for a glass of water when you


---------55:03----------
can get it from your sink right like


---------55:06----------
your brain is fundamentally like this


---------55:07----------
the other thing is we're not lazy we're


---------55:09----------
efficient we're designed to be efficient


---------55:10----------
like kids do you know do you know why


---------55:13----------
kids skip wife gives skip school know


---------55:17----------
why they skip like you know what


---------55:18----------
skipping is like physically oh oh it's


---------55:22----------
kind of weird I like kids skip they


---------55:24----------
start skipping at some point in their


---------55:25----------
life and then they stop skipping like


---------55:28----------
what the [ __ ] is up with that then it


---------55:30----------
happens like what what age of kids skip


---------55:35----------
seven yeah it's [ __ ] weird what's


---------55:39----------
with that the reason that they skip is


---------55:41----------
because due to their height their muscle


---------55:44----------
and their beanies skipping is the most


---------55:46----------
efficient way to move there's a certain


---------55:49----------
like magical ratio when they're a


---------55:51----------
certain age where skipping is actually


---------55:53----------
like more efficient than like walking or


---------55:55----------
running and it's a very brief window and


---------55:58----------
once they like cross that certain


---------56:00----------
threshold they don't do it anymore and


---------56:03----------
here's the other thing that I weird


---------56:04----------
question you ever seen


---------56:05----------
kid skip no cuz they don't hit that body


---------56:11----------
mass ratio that's why fat kids don't


---------56:15----------
skip


---------56:15----------
it's like bizarre like our brain is


---------56:18----------
constantly iterating to make things as


---------56:21----------
efficiently as possible


---------56:23----------
I okay so do you feel like is obviously


---------56:27----------
there are certain people you know with


---------56:29----------
the the wide spectrum of people's like


---------56:32----------
sizes and muscle masses and everything


---------56:34----------
in adulthood do you feel like the reason


---------56:36----------
why people don't do it as much in


---------56:37----------
adulthood is because of the social norm


---------56:40----------
so skipping naturally disappears like by


---------56:44----------
the time you're like 12 right like you


---------56:46----------
don't see me major skipping okay


---------56:48----------
and that's just because it becomes


---------56:51----------
inefficient it's just an efficient way


---------56:53----------
of movement so it's it's completely


---------56:56----------
inefficient for an adult no matter what


---------56:59----------
you have adult are yep absolutely


---------57:01----------
it's like it and that's why they start


---------57:03----------
at 7 it's inefficient for a


---------57:05----------
five-year-old efficient for a


---------57:07----------
seven-year-old and like by the time you


---------57:08----------
hit 12 or 13 it becomes inefficient well


---------57:11----------
whenever you see people skipping usually


---------57:14----------
after like a really happy event happens


---------57:16----------
in their life you know I like you see us


---------57:18----------
in movies all the time how does that fit


---------57:20----------
into it is that just kind of because at


---------57:23----------
that point it's an emotional expression


---------57:25----------
it's good it's not a mode of movement


---------57:28----------
but like words will skip when they're


---------57:30----------
not happy they'll just skip like they'll


---------57:32----------
just yeah transit from one place to


---------57:35----------
another through skipping and it's just


---------57:38----------
like a weird phenomenon right like as


---------57:39----------
they just start doing it around the age


---------57:41----------
of seven and then they sort of like to


---------57:42----------
stop and some some fat kids do skip by


---------57:45----------
the way but yeah I'm sorry for asking so


---------57:47----------
many questions about this no idea yeah


---------57:52----------
okay I think that you're right about


---------57:53----------
being efficient I'm I've always been I


---------57:56----------
mean I'm so efficient now that you know


---------57:59----------
I found a way to have people pay me to


---------58:01----------
sit at home and play video games


---------58:02----------
yeah like I consider that this is the


---------58:05----------
pinnacle of my efficiency no absolutely


---------58:07----------
right and so it's also the pinnacle of


---------58:09----------
your laziness yes so like let's start by


---------58:14----------
sort of so you say it's things that I'm


---------58:16----------
supposed to and then then you say I need


---------58:18----------
right and then you use this word need


---------58:21----------
and where do you get the idea that you


---------58:22----------
need to because your brain is like hey


---------58:24----------
bro like in the past you've thought that


---------58:26----------
we've needed to do things and you turned


---------58:27----------
out to be [ __ ] wrong so why am i


---------58:29----------
going to invest all of this time and


---------58:32----------
energy to do something that is


---------58:33----------
unnecessary I'll give you a pretty a


---------58:37----------
pretty strong need and my teeth see that


---------58:41----------
missing teeth I'm also missing other


---------58:45----------
teeth that are easier to see or sorry


---------58:47----------
harder to see they're not gonna grow


---------58:50----------
back and it gets worse every day


---------58:53----------
why do I not fix it well I'm lazy and


---------58:57----------
I'm afraid of doing it that's


---------58:59----------
fundamentally what it is okay and like I


---------59:03----------
and and this is how lazy I I really am


---------59:06----------
these teeth are fake but I only fix this


---------59:09----------
side because I always look at this


---------59:12----------
monitor to stream with and I never


---------59:13----------
really look this direction on stream so


---------59:16----------
nobody really ever sees that one okay so


---------59:18----------
let's let's unpack a beautiful example


---------59:21----------
okay so let's think about this like so


---------59:23----------
what is your brain I'm gonna read I'm


---------59:25----------
gonna read I'm gonna re brain that out


---------59:29----------
of laziness okay you ready for it so the


---------59:31----------
first thing is like why do you fix one


---------59:33----------
side because your brain is like hey bro


---------59:35----------
we only really need one side because


---------59:38----------
this is the way that in streams so like


---------59:39----------
why would we fix both sides if we only


---------59:41----------
need one side it's pretty [ __ ]


---------59:46----------
ridiculous when you verbalize it isn't


---------59:48----------
it no it's not ridiculous at all what


---------59:50----------
I'm telling you is it's the exact


---------59:51----------
opposite of ridiculous it makes perfect


---------59:53----------
sense you even know why you fix the one


---------59:55----------
side because you only need to fix one


---------59:57----------
side well here's the problem though is


---------59:59----------
like I believe this is true too but then


---------60:03----------
I tell other people that and they think


---------60:04----------
that I'm crazy yeah so I want you and


---------60:08----------
everyone else at home to start with the


---------60:11----------
default of you're not crazy because very


---------60:14----------
few people in the world are crazy just


---------60:16----------
because you don't understand how you


---------60:19----------
work does not mean that you're


---------60:21----------
malfunctioning this is the biggest


---------60:23----------
problem with our entire generation agree


---------60:27----------
with you entirely by a hundred percent


---------60:29----------
agree they assume that ignorance be


---------60:32----------
hums malfunction when it has been my


---------60:35----------
overwhelming experience that like the


---------60:38----------
world makes sense and that human beings


---------60:41----------
operate like not randomly like we're not


---------60:44----------
random right we have all these organ


---------60:45----------
systems we have a brain our brain is a


---------60:48----------
super complicated organ it's not a super


---------60:50----------
complicated organ it hasn't grown itself


---------60:53----------
evolved to be this malfunctioning organ


---------60:55----------
it's in fact the exact opposite our


---------60:57----------
brain is a hyper functional organ which


---------61:00----------
has allowed us to dominate the earth and


---------61:02----------
like Hubble into space and we think that


---------61:06----------
the thing is fundamentally busted


---------61:08----------
because it doesn't want to fix a one


---------61:09----------
side of your mouth like no man like your


---------61:12----------
brain has a damn good reason and you


---------61:13----------
even know what that is so now let's work


---------61:16----------
good I'm very good at intellectualizing


---------61:19----------
things for me not to do because well it


---------61:22----------
is a good reason in that context but if


---------61:26----------
you only eat with one side of your mouth


---------61:27----------
let me tell you there are problems that


---------61:30----------
that causes sure and yeah and ultimately


---------61:34----------
I just don't think about those problems


---------61:36----------
and that that's it and so even though I


---------61:41----------
know it will become more and more of a


---------61:43----------
problem as time goes on I just kind of


---------61:46----------
let it happen


---------61:47----------
yep yeah I think that's really okay just


---------61:50----------
stop talking for a second sorry they're


---------61:52----------
just just once I I don't want to lose


---------61:53----------
because you're saying so much good [ __ ]


---------61:55----------
I literally have to write it down


---------61:56----------
because I need to respond to it so once


---------61:58----------
I wore it no problem


---------62:00----------
I know sometimes this comes across as


---------62:02----------
being an [ __ ] I really don't mean


---------62:04----------
that but like you were just talking


---------62:05----------
about pure gold and the answer is right


---------62:07----------
there so I really want to capture this


---------62:09----------
okay I'm used to dealing with [ __ ]


---------62:11----------
all day this is not actually being an


---------62:13----------
[ __ ] trust me okay


---------62:20----------
yeah okay okay I'm pulling it closer to


---------62:32----------
me and the gain is down okay thank you


---------62:34----------
okay okay feet oh [ __ ] I lost damn it


---------62:42----------
don't me say what I said before


---------62:44----------
nope


---------62:54----------
you


---------62:58----------
okay okay yeah keep going now okay so


---------63:03----------
yeah I think that's kind of what happens


---------63:06----------
is I will do something and even though I


---------63:08----------
I know that it will have a bad long-term


---------63:10----------
effect I will just do it because the


---------63:13----------
short-term effect is worth it to me and


---------63:16----------
you know for for some degree I don't


---------63:19----------
really like I don't like going to the


---------63:21----------
dentist it'll make me take time off of


---------63:22----------
streaming so it would just be easier for


---------63:25----------
me to just simply put it off and


---------63:28----------
intellectualizing these problems and


---------63:31----------
thinking them through and rationalizing


---------63:33----------
well I can I'm really good at this I'm


---------63:35----------
really good at that it's the same as I


---------63:36----------
can video games you know you have like


---------63:38----------
one person that's really good at doing


---------63:40----------
you know spell that you know casting


---------63:43----------
magic spells and another person who's


---------63:44----------
really good at you know shooting a bow


---------63:46----------
and arrow and I always intellectualize


---------63:50----------
this is I'm very good at doing certain


---------63:52----------
things and very bad at doing other


---------63:54----------
things okay


---------63:56----------
I completely agree yeah so this is what


---------63:59----------
we're gonna do okay hold on a second


---------64:01----------
okay I'm gonna do a little bit of a


---------64:04----------
screen show okay I'm gonna actually try


---------64:07----------
to draw out an equation for you okay do


---------64:15----------
this I'm gonna switch and then I also


---------64:20----------
have to screen show you a screen not do


---------64:27----------
that


---------64:30----------
you can't see this can you not right now


---------64:33----------
no you right-click the transcript yeah


---------64:45----------
there we go now okay can you see me okay


---------64:48----------
yes and you guys okay so now we're gonna


---------64:51----------
we're gonna unpack the behave we're


---------64:53----------
gonna call this laziness right so tell


---------64:55----------
us that this problem is gonna be


---------64:57----------
why doesn't Jack get his teeth fixed


---------65:07----------
right so your answer is because I'm lazy


---------65:12----------
and scared oh well no no no no no no no


---------65:17----------
no okay we'll get there because you're


---------65:19----------
lazy right this is the conception that


---------65:21----------
you have okay so let's think about let's


---------65:26----------
think about I'm gonna put an equal sign


---------65:29----------
here I don't know exactly how this is


---------65:30----------
gonna work cuz I'm working this out okay


---------65:32----------
so like let's say that oh actually let's


---------65:34----------
let's do it this way let's do a plus


---------65:42----------
fallin and a minus call


---------65:48----------
okay so reasons to see see the dentists


---------65:51----------
and reasons to not see the cons okay so


---------65:54----------
like in so what we want to do is like


---------65:56----------
either this is gonna be this way or it's


---------65:58----------
gonna be this way


---------65:59----------
right it's gonna be either more so and


---------66:02----------
then basically as long as you're winning


---------66:05----------
this it's gonna be a complete mess okay


---------66:08----------
so as long as it's this way this means


---------66:12----------
you don't see that that de stright yeah


---------66:15----------
and and as long as this is what you're


---------66:17----------
doing we call this lazy do you see that


---------66:20----------
Oh conclude like if you're gonna let


---------66:25----------
this you call it lazy right yeah okay


---------66:28----------
so so let's think about reasons to not


---------66:31----------
see the dentist you're afraid okay


---------66:34----------
reasons to see the dentist your teeth is


---------66:37----------
broke yes


---------66:40----------
okay so that


---------66:42----------
let's think about this for a second so


---------66:45----------
you have the capacity to not think about


---------66:49----------
things and distract yourself right yep


---------66:52----------
so what do you think if I were to I'm


---------66:55----------
just kind of run with me for a second


---------66:57----------
right so like what distraction does is


---------67:00----------
essentially decreases the value of this


---------67:02----------
variable yeah pretty much do you see


---------67:07----------
that okay so the better you are at


---------67:09----------
distracting yourself what happens to


---------67:11----------
your laziness or it goes up absolutely


---------67:17----------
right so like yeah


---------67:18----------
for us gamers like here's the problem


---------67:20----------
there's like boomer distractions which


---------67:22----------
is like one downward arrow and then


---------67:24----------
there's video games which are designed


---------67:27----------
to make you forget so what video games


---------67:30----------
actually do is they shot off the parts


---------67:33----------
of your brain that experience negative


---------67:34----------
emotion so there's huh if you ever had a


---------67:39----------
day where like your internet didn't work


---------67:41----------
and it was like the most productive day


---------67:42----------
of your whole month


---------67:47----------
I think that's yeah I actually haven't


---------67:51----------
sorry but I can totally get behind what


---------67:53----------
you're saying yeah because I remember


---------67:55----------
days where my internet didn't work and I


---------67:58----------
just painfully tried to distract myself


---------68:02----------
in tons of unsatisfying ways but still


---------68:04----------
ended up procrastinating that's honestly


---------68:07----------
my recollection of days when entire that


---------68:09----------
didn't work I didn't have a computer I


---------68:11----------
didn't become productive


---------68:12----------
I just distracted myself and enjoyed


---------68:15----------
myself less yeah I sometimes I'll


---------68:19----------
actually have a very productive day if I


---------68:21----------
my computer stops working or my internet


---------68:23----------
stops working because there'll be


---------68:24----------
nothing else for me to do yeah that's


---------68:27----------
really awesome I'm glad you can have


---------68:28----------
that experience I think unfortunately


---------68:29----------
many people don't have even that


---------68:31----------
experience so let's let me ask you this


---------68:34----------
okay so now let's think about it's more


---------68:35----------
and more of a problem so there's more


---------68:37----------
and more of the problem go on the plus


---------68:39----------
side or the minus side whoa I mean like


---------68:45----------
it'd go on the plus side absolutely yeah


---------68:53----------
why is it doing this thing


---------68:58----------
[ __ ]


---------69:04----------
you


---------69:05----------
there we go okay so now we're gonna


---------69:11----------
learn something really important about


---------69:12----------
the brain okay when it comes to the


---------69:15----------
brains behavior thing how does it rank


---------69:23----------
future rewards versus presents I mean to


---------69:30----------
ask mobile game developers this you know


---------69:33----------
the instant gratification is king yeah


---------69:38----------
so I want you to understand that that


---------69:41----------
like there's something funny going on


---------69:42----------
right like you say it's more and more of


---------69:44----------
a problem in that it's gonna be a


---------69:45----------
catastrophic it's gonna be catastrophic


---------69:48----------
in the future so you wouldn't think that


---------69:51----------
a catastrophic result in the future is


---------69:55----------
going to bias you towards action today


---------69:59----------
yeah but here's the funny thing is like


---------70:01----------
the further off in the future it is the


---------70:05----------
less important it becomes because that's


---------70:06----------
just how our brain works right like the


---------70:09----------
animals that survive are the ones that


---------70:11----------
like sort of bias themselves towards the


---------70:13----------
president like when when there were


---------70:15----------
primitive human beings who are being


---------70:16----------
faced by tigers and if they thought a


---------70:19----------
little bit like if they thought in that


---------70:20----------
moment about okay like if the tiger


---------70:23----------
attacks me and I lose a limb I won't be


---------70:25----------
able to harvest or so my fields so like


---------70:29----------
that's gonna be a real problem like no


---------70:31----------
like that's dumb like the the human


---------70:33----------
beings who survived were the ones who


---------70:34----------
faced the immediate problems right and


---------70:36----------
so like the the issue here is that sure


---------70:39----------
it's gonna be more of a more of a


---------70:40----------
problem in the future but like today


---------70:43----------
what do you do instead play video games


---------70:48----------
absolutely right


---------70:52----------
so so just because it's gonna get worse


---------70:54----------
and worse every day that's not actually


---------70:57----------
a reason for you to like do something


---------71:00----------
about it today it just means that you


---------71:01----------
don't have to do something about it


---------71:03----------
today because you can do something about


---------71:05----------
it tomorrow


---------71:06----------
and then tomorrow rolls around and you


---------71:08----------
can do something about it tomorrow so in


---------71:10----------
a weird way yeah right


---------71:16----------
right yeah so let's think about a couple


---------71:21----------
of other things


---------71:22----------
oh yeah so let's like think about this


---------71:24----------
right so like so let's think about one


---------71:26----------
side of the mouth okay so if we change


---------71:29----------
this to one side of the mouth like if


---------71:31----------
we're thinking about one side yeah the


---------71:36----------
mouth how does that change your equation


---------71:40----------
because like then is there an immediate


---------71:43----------
benefit of getting your teeth on one


---------71:46----------
side of your face fixed yes there is is


---------71:50----------
that way right yeah it would help this


---------71:52----------
stream I I don't there I'm fine


---------71:54----------
portraying myself as a degenerate but I


---------71:57----------
do draw the line that missing teeth


---------71:59----------
right so it's like what the interesting


---------72:00----------
thing is that then what happens is like


---------72:02----------
today moves over here


---------72:03----------
yeah and then once today moves over here


---------72:06----------
what do you do just forget about know


---------72:13----------
what whenever you get it fixed right cuz


---------72:15----------
you by that's oh yeah yeah right yes so


---------72:19----------
that's that's why guys like there's an


---------72:21----------
immediate benefit to it which is that


---------72:23----------
when you stream you're not gonna look


---------72:25----------
like a complete degenerate in life and


---------72:28----------
like this this isn't gonna make you look


---------72:30----------
like a complete degenerate for a long


---------72:32----------
time but like you don't want to look


---------72:33----------
like it you're okay with looking like a


---------72:35----------
complete degenerate a year from now your


---------72:38----------
brain is even though it terrifies you


---------72:41----------
right and this is the other interesting


---------72:43----------
thing is that the more emotions that you


---------72:46----------
pack in based on your future failures


---------72:48----------
how does that affect our diagram as you


---------72:53----------
think about being a degenerate in the


---------72:54----------
future what do you think that does to


---------72:56----------
your laziness uh well it depends I mean


---------73:02----------
like it could make you want to be less


---------73:04----------
lazy because you wouldn't want to be a


---------73:05----------
digital right in the future or you could


---------73:07----------
just put more of it off into the future


---------73:09----------
and think I you know what you know


---------73:11----------
that's not happening me right now I'll


---------73:13----------
deal with that then okay so let me ask


---------73:15----------
you a question great answer where -


---------73:18----------
which column does shame going less lazy


---------73:23----------
or more lazy both okay


---------73:27----------
excellent so let's think about how can


---------73:29----------
it be both well I mean you go to the


---------73:34----------
dentist and they're like you know they


---------73:38----------
tell me about other stories about other


---------73:39----------
people who have had the same problem and


---------73:41----------
it's like yeah this person was addicted


---------73:43----------
to crack this person was homeless or


---------73:46----------
whatever and then it's me yeah this


---------73:49----------
person was just lazy I mean you kind of


---------73:51----------
feel like a jackass okay so how does


---------73:54----------
that prompt you does that tip the


---------73:56----------
balance towards doing something or away


---------73:59----------
from doing something away from because I


---------74:01----------
you know self.cards even confronting it


---------74:03----------
yep so shame goes over here right


---------74:06----------
the funny thing is that like the more


---------74:08----------
and more of a problem is it is that


---------74:12----------
increases your sense of shame and as


---------74:14----------
your shame increases you you become more


---------74:18----------
lazy does that make sense um yes it does


---------74:25----------
I think there's there's another like


---------74:27----------
weird kind of circumstantial variable


---------74:30----------
with this which is they told me that


---------74:33----------
they were gonna have to pull out all of


---------74:34----------
my teeth and then now they're telling me


---------74:37----------
that they're not cuz I'm seeing a new


---------74:39----------
dentist so before the reason I didn't


---------74:42----------
get it fixed as I just said [ __ ] it


---------74:44----------
they're gonna pull them all out anyway


---------74:45----------
I'll deal with it later and you now yeah


---------74:49----------
I have more of like a immediacy of


---------74:53----------
fixing it okay yes so so now now we can


---------74:57----------
see like so you see how today puts it in


---------75:00----------
this column and future puts it in this


---------75:02----------
column so you're even saying I have more


---------75:06----------
urgency because like you can't yes


---------75:08----------
become less future-oriented it's become


---------75:10----------
more present oriented yes


---------75:12----------
okay well because I thought before the


---------75:16----------
damage was already done and so it was a


---------75:18----------
guy you know what who cares right now


---------75:21----------
there's no alteration there's no


---------75:24----------
alteration over your trajectory if the


---------75:26----------
damage is done so why would you rent it


---------75:28----------
yeah


---------75:29----------
that's it's lazy eats but yeah okay sure


---------75:32----------
it's annoying to eat so so now now I'm


---------75:35----------
gonna ask you so like now the question


---------75:36----------
Zack is like okay so all this stuff is


---------75:38----------
is great all ocher dr. kay


---------75:40----------
what the [ __ ] do I do about it right so


---------75:42----------
let's think about this for a second okay


---------75:44----------
you know how can I adjust these


---------75:47----------
variables to tip the balance in the


---------75:50----------
other way if I want to do this like this


---------75:58----------
if I want this to happen what do i what


---------76:02----------
can I do to this equation to like make


---------76:04----------
the arrow tip this way lose the shame


---------76:09----------
absolutely right so now that's why


---------76:11----------
that's why I showed people on my stream


---------76:13----------
so that's who one is Shane okay when I


---------76:17----------
step you chain okay sure except one uh


---------76:24----------
III think be less afraid okay you know


---------76:27----------
in my kind of the in the same is like


---------76:29----------
there's a moment of enlightenment


---------76:30----------
there's also moments of courage okay


---------76:34----------
okay take aim and your thumbs so we're


---------76:37----------
actually gonna put moment of


---------76:39----------
enlightenment over here right so let me


---------76:42----------
ask you when you have a moment of


---------76:44----------
enlightenment what is it due to your


---------76:47----------
laziness well we were talking before


---------76:51----------
about how it kind of hi Jackson laziness


---------76:54----------
so I Jackson after work not during them


---------76:56----------
or during it um yeah III think I I


---------77:01----------
usually just I do what I need to do


---------77:04----------
right


---------77:05----------
exactly good way to San yeah so moment


---------77:07----------
of enlightenment goes over here so the


---------77:09----------
laziness paradigm we'll talk about in a


---------77:11----------
second but then what else can you do to


---------77:14----------
anything else that you can see in this


---------77:16----------
equation that we could adjust to


---------77:18----------
decrease your laziness


---------77:25----------
a lot of ways that you could say it but


---------77:29----------
make that the future the future is more


---------77:34----------
finite and so because it's more finite


---------77:37----------
then this is not the way I'm going to


---------77:39----------
represent Oh perfect


---------77:41----------
right yes and now now you said there's a


---------77:44----------
lot of ways that you can say this is the


---------77:46----------
first thing that I want to point out to


---------77:47----------
you is doing this logically doesn't help


---------77:50----------
right telling yourself that you


---------77:53----------
shouldn't be ashamed or that you


---------77:55----------
shouldn't have fear and logically trying


---------77:57----------
to overcome your fear or play around


---------77:59----------
with this philosophizing laying in your


---------78:01----------
bed how does that affect your laziness


---------78:04----------
it really doesn't very thinking about


---------78:09----------
your emotions does not actually change


---------78:11----------
them okay so thinking and telling


---------78:16----------
yourself I need to be focused in the


---------78:18----------
present does not change it right like


---------78:21----------
now we get to Vidya and yawn Vidya


---------78:23----------
doesn't change behavior or very rarely


---------78:25----------
but it's not a good predictor of


---------78:28----------
behavioral change


---------78:29----------
yawn is a changes through experience


---------78:33----------
right so like like this is where there's


---------78:35----------
a shift in mindset to be present focus


---------78:39----------
versus future focus and this is like


---------78:42----------
what all the Buddhists are talking about


---------78:43----------
like what there wasn't a philosopher


---------78:45----------
it's become a philosophy it's become


---------78:47----------
something that's posted on Instagram


---------78:49----------
it's become something that's tweeted but


---------78:51----------
Buddha wasn't teaching philosophy he's


---------78:53----------
not a philosopher Buddha was like a


---------78:55----------
personal trainer for the mind he was


---------78:57----------
saying there is a systematic process to


---------79:00----------
take your mind from here and move it


---------79:04----------
here there's a systematic process of


---------79:08----------
changing your mindset to be present


---------79:11----------
focused as opposed to future focused you


---------79:13----------
can literally train your mind huh okay


---------79:16----------
you're looking at it more functionally


---------79:18----------
absolutely it's all functional and then


---------79:21----------
we have so on the opposite side of


---------79:23----------
functional is something that the


---------79:25----------
psychotherapist stumbled upon and they


---------79:28----------
said that if we actually sit with a


---------79:30----------
therapist and talk about your fear and


---------79:32----------
shame something magical happens people


---------79:35----------
start putting their lives together it's


---------79:37----------
[ __ ] weird like


---------79:38----------
I can talk to someone like I it's weird


---------79:41----------
I can talk to someone about you know how


---------79:43----------
they were bullied in high school and


---------79:45----------
then they start eating out I mean eating


---------79:47----------
healthy and working out and the reason


---------79:50----------
it's like not connected at all it's not


---------79:52----------
like they're coming in and talking to me


---------79:54----------
about like because sometimes they do


---------79:56----------
that people will come in and they'll say


---------79:58----------
like how do I start working out and then


---------80:00----------
I give them a plane right I say like


---------80:01----------
okay you need to wake up every day


---------80:03----------
here's your personal trainer you got to


---------80:04----------
go to the gym eat these kinds of


---------80:06----------
calories and then what happens act when


---------80:08----------
I give them a plan for being healthy


---------80:10----------
they stop on January 2nd absolutely


---------80:14----------
right because that's not a workout plan


---------80:18----------
is like maybe a little bit over here but


---------80:23----------
it's very small it's tiny


---------80:26----------
well it's it's an emotional you have to


---------80:29----------
overcome and emotionally I agree with


---------80:31----------
that I know that like so one way that I


---------80:33----------
overcame this with like keeping my house


---------80:35----------
clean is that I live with my mom and I


---------80:38----------
remember I was showing it was like


---------80:41----------
something that I had done for her


---------80:42----------
recently and someone said that you know


---------80:44----------
well you should be doing this all the


---------80:46----------
time because you're letting your mom


---------80:47----------
live in a [ __ ]


---------80:49----------
which is like for me this is the norm


---------80:51----------
but I thought to myself it's like I am


---------80:53----------
doing that and I should be doing that


---------80:55----------
and that emotional webberley


---------80:57----------
revelation it wasn't like logical the


---------80:59----------
emotional revelation of knowing that I


---------81:01----------
was allowing this to happen to her has


---------81:03----------
caused me to be much more proactive and


---------81:05----------
keeping the house clean and making


---------81:08----------
things like you know I there were like


---------81:10----------
holes in the wall where rats were coming


---------81:12----------
through and I cover all those up and I


---------81:15----------
kept it clean because I realized that


---------81:17----------
what I was doing and the laziness that I


---------81:19----------
was exhibiting were it was something


---------81:24----------
that was hurting somebody else okay it


---------81:27----------
was selfish


---------81:27----------
so now we're gonna understand three


---------81:29----------
things me is over here yeah other people


---------81:37----------
he's over here what do you think about


---------81:39----------
that


---------81:43----------
yeah I'd say that's right


---------81:46----------
so the first thing is you said that you


---------81:47----------
had to overcome emotion so now when


---------81:49----------
you're kind of saying like you know at


---------81:51----------
the beginning of this conversation you


---------81:52----------
were like talking about death I don't


---------81:53----------
think is gonna be productive and I


---------81:55----------
completely agree with you because


---------81:56----------
overcoming emotions is not thinking


---------81:58----------
about emotions you use the word and it


---------82:01----------
is AK I think you understand this stuff


---------82:03----------
really well because of your language use


---------82:05----------
the word emotional revelation a


---------82:07----------
revelation is not a logical conclusion


---------82:09----------
do you see that it's like like


---------82:12----------
revelation doesn't imply a logical


---------82:15----------
thought process it implies a white hole


---------82:17----------
in them it literally of Revelation is


---------82:20----------
revealed and revealed is something that


---------82:23----------
you are the recipient of not something


---------82:25----------
that you take action you are


---------82:28----------
fundamentally not control when it comes


---------82:30----------
to emotional revelation it is the loot


---------82:32----------
box all over again


---------82:34----------
it is the chest it is the moment of


---------82:36----------
enlightenment I think I've had that


---------82:39----------
happen a few sorry guys good okay yeah


---------82:44----------
sorry okay working on it yeah that


---------82:46----------
happened a few times with like different


---------82:48----------
situations and the point where you know


---------82:51----------
things that used to bother me just for


---------82:53----------
whatever reason stopped bothering me


---------82:55----------
yeah like that's weird right like how do


---------82:58----------
we even deal with that like what's up


---------83:00----------
with that oh I think it depends on the


---------83:05----------
thing I used to be very self-conscious


---------83:08----------
about the way that I looked and then I


---------83:11----------
think that as time went on I just


---------83:13----------
accepted it and it was who I got you


---------83:15----------
know I am Who I am okay so that's so so


---------83:18----------
now like like okay so now like you're


---------83:20----------
really starting to sound like a


---------83:22----------
meditation catalog is that bad or good


---------83:27----------
no I mean it's great like this is why


---------83:29----------
this is what would that was saying but


---------83:30----------
it's not philosophy and it's not stuff


---------83:32----------
that you retweet retweeting it doesn't


---------83:34----------
matter but acceptance goes over here


---------83:36----------
right well it it's fundamental


---------83:39----------
acceptance right like I'm very very


---------83:41----------
skinny and I used to like not want to


---------83:44----------
take my shirt off in the pool or


---------83:46----------
whatever and I think that this might


---------83:49----------
sound bad boy people making fun of me


---------83:51----------
about it all the time on on Twitch and


---------83:53----------
like just constantly like giving it to


---------83:55----------
me and just [ __ ] with me about it


---------83:57----------
like I just eventually got it sounds


---------83:59----------
like whatever you know like I'm not


---------84:02----------
gonna apologize to these people so Who I


---------84:04----------
am yeah so so that that is do you see


---------84:07----------
how you used to have shame and then you


---------84:09----------
move towards acceptance somehow but it


---------84:11----------
wasn't logical it wasn't like you woke


---------84:13----------
up one day and you said hey this is


---------84:16----------
gonna I'm gonna they're gonna keep on


---------84:17----------
making fun of me until I get used to it


---------84:19----------
and then my thick my skin will get thick


---------84:21----------
and then I will accept that I'm skinny


---------84:23----------
that's not how it works it's a


---------84:24----------
revelation it's something that happens


---------84:26----------
to you it's not something that you do


---------84:30----------
okay right and now we get to the root of


---------84:34----------
lazy because what we're talking about


---------84:36----------
here is that you cannot actually do


---------84:38----------
anything


---------84:39----------
it's about stuff that happens to you


---------84:41----------
it's not about logically working through


---------84:43----------
your fear and your shame it's not about


---------84:46----------
it's about Revelation right it's about


---------84:50----------
mindset these are things that happen to


---------84:52----------
you they're not things that you do and


---------84:54----------
now we get to this idea of like the


---------84:56----------
reason that you believe you're lazy is


---------84:57----------
because you believe you're in control


---------84:58----------
but you're not in control you can't


---------85:01----------
actually get your teeth fixed what you


---------85:04----------
can do is potentially see a therapist


---------85:06----------
and roll the dice to see if you can


---------85:09----------
cleanse the fear deep off in the shame


---------85:11----------
debuff you can roll the dice or you can


---------85:14----------
train yourself to be present focused


---------85:17----------
instead of future focused and each of


---------85:20----------
these things that you do like look at


---------85:22----------
this equation what do you think is gonna


---------85:23----------
happen with lazy oh I think it'll go


---------85:29----------
down if I lose those two things


---------85:31----------
absolutely and then you'll start acting


---------85:34----------
so it's not that you're lazy it's that


---------85:36----------
your behavioral equation calculates you


---------85:39----------
to inaction


---------85:41----------
and the problem is that you don't


---------85:42----------
understand any of this stuff because


---------85:44----------
like here's the biggest problem is that


---------85:46----------
like this is all a black box right this


---------85:49----------
is what we see yeah and so then we just


---------85:53----------
call it lazy and so it's no surprise


---------85:56----------
that our entire like you note which is


---------85:58----------
like super lazy why are they super lazy


---------86:00----------
it's because they have a ton of fear and


---------86:02----------
shame they don't understand they think


---------86:04----------
in the future like just think about this


---------86:06----------
for a second they're always thinking


---------86:07----------
about the future one day right they're


---------86:10----------
thinking about the future and this is


---------86:12----------
the other thing so past it's back here


---------86:14----------
to they think about the future and they


---------86:17----------
think about the past they have a case of


---------86:18----------
the shirt of what it could is and the if


---------86:20----------
onlys if only this or only this I should


---------86:24----------
do this I'm supposed to do this I need


---------86:26----------
to do this all of those should is not in


---------86:30----------
the present it's in the future if only


---------86:33----------
is in the past it's not in the present


---------86:36----------
the other problem that they have and I


---------86:39----------
know you want to jump in but I'm feeling


---------86:41----------
that right now so I'm gonna keep talking


---------86:42----------
do it


---------86:43----------
keep Duffy the other thing is that


---------86:45----------
they're always focused on me and that


---------86:47----------
doesn't mean that they're selfish it


---------86:48----------
means that if I were to literally


---------86:50----------
catalog the number of thoughts in their


---------86:52----------
mind the number of thoughts about


---------86:55----------
themselves far outweighs the number of


---------86:57----------
thoughts about other people


---------86:59----------
doesn't mean that they're good thoughts


---------87:01----------
they're just egocentric it's I'm a piece


---------87:04----------
of [ __ ] I'm lazy I should do this I


---------87:07----------
should do that that person is so awesome


---------87:10----------
and even when you say that person is so


---------87:12----------
awesome if it's an appreciation of that


---------87:14----------
person it's not about you even when they


---------87:16----------
think about another person it's in


---------87:18----------
reference to themselves it's actually a


---------87:20----------
thought about themselves it's a thought


---------87:25----------
about themselves even whenever they're


---------87:27----------
thinking about somebody else because


---------87:29----------
it's a comparison there are two ways to


---------87:30----------
think about other people


---------87:32----------
one way is it is a comparison like oh


---------87:34----------
that person is so awesome the other one


---------87:36----------
is appreciation an appreciation makes


---------87:38----------
them feel good in comparison makes them


---------87:40----------
feel bad so even when they think they're


---------87:42----------
thinking about other people they're


---------87:44----------
always making comparisons to themselves


---------87:46----------
and so literally the percentage of time


---------87:50----------
that they


---------87:51----------
spend over here is 90% and they only


---------87:55----------
spent 10% of time thinking about other


---------87:57----------
people and that's what I was saying


---------87:59----------
about the selfishness exactly and now we


---------88:03----------
think about da da mo which is due to


---------88:05----------
your responsibility because you aren't


---------88:08----------
worth it right especially like if you


---------88:10----------
have fear and shame your value as a


---------88:12----------
human being is pretty low therefore


---------88:13----------
you're not even worth investing in the


---------88:16----------
thing that gets you to to clean up your


---------88:18----------
place is a sense of duty for your mom


---------88:21----------
and you're like I can visit my it's ok


---------88:24----------
if I live in a [ __ ] because I'm me


---------88:26----------
but it's not ok for my mom to live in a


---------88:28----------
[ __ ]


---------88:28----------
yeah and that thought is not like a


---------88:31----------
logical thought it's also like a


---------88:33----------
revelation well I thought about this I


---------88:38----------
actually you know I have no regrets


---------88:41----------
I don't even regret letting my teeth rot


---------88:44----------
out because the reason why I started


---------88:47----------
streaming and what motivated me to try


---------88:50----------
so hard with streaming is that I knew


---------88:52----------
that if I didn't do that and I wasn't


---------88:54----------
successful I wouldn't have any teeth I


---------88:57----------
don't regret a single thing yeah so and


---------89:00----------
I I don't really regret any of these


---------89:03----------
things happening and III don't I do


---------89:06----------
think that it should be more about like


---------89:08----------
other people too though and and I feel


---------89:10----------
like that's kind of what's ended up


---------89:12----------
happening is that I've tried to focus


---------89:13----------
more on being like being not really a


---------89:20----------
servant to other people but being a [ __ ]


---------89:25----------
what's the word for this


---------89:31----------
to fulfill the purpose that way yeah you


---------89:36----------
haven't since are much your street


---------89:38----------
screamer's yeah what you're describing


---------89:40----------
is done right like you stream because


---------89:42----------
like you are the thing you streamed for


---------89:46----------
them because you're trying to send them


---------89:48----------
a signal that you can be a [ __ ] in


---------89:50----------
life and still have a life worth living


---------89:53----------
that's the tournament that's why you


---------89:55----------
stream that's a reason to be proud of it


---------89:57----------
and happy yeah absolutely


---------89:59----------
so like you need to show them that yeah


---------90:03----------
and and that's what I was so upset about


---------90:05----------
whenever I had taken two breaks and in


---------90:07----------
my stream I had felt like I had lost


---------90:10----------
them yes I no longer had that that thing


---------90:16----------
that just motivated me you know whether


---------90:18----------
you have a good day or a bad day you are


---------90:20----------
gone the next day because there is a


---------90:22----------
purpose and the goal that's greater than


---------90:24----------
yourself it's not just about you it's


---------90:27----------
about what you represent who you are and


---------90:29----------
the idea so if we look at the equation


---------90:31----------
of that there's something very important


---------90:33----------
there which is that generally speaking


---------90:35----------
we operate when it comes to ourselves we


---------90:39----------
move away from pain and we move towards


---------90:41----------
pleasure we try to avoid pain and we try


---------90:45----------
to seek pleasure but the cool thing


---------90:47----------
about Dharma is is like Dharma is what


---------90:50----------
allows you to say whether I have a good


---------90:52----------
day or I have a bad day I have to keep


---------90:55----------
streaming it's not about whether it


---------90:57----------
hurts or not I need to do it for that


---------91:00----------
yes right and so like that's the


---------91:03----------
beautiful thing is like Dharma is in in


---------91:05----------
my sense a pretty good answer to


---------91:08----------
embracing the negative or embracing the


---------91:11----------
things that are hardened and the biggest


---------91:14----------
problem that people have nowadays is


---------91:16----------
that like they tend to retreat from


---------91:17----------
things that are hard or painful yeah and


---------91:21----------
and so in your case like your fear of


---------91:24----------
the dentist like the reason that you're


---------91:25----------
not going to the dentist we can look at


---------91:27----------
anything in that equation right so one


---------91:28----------
is you can talk about your fear of the


---------91:30----------
dentist and if you talk about your fear


---------91:32----------
of the dentist and you process it it'll


---------91:34----------
start to wither away and then you'll be


---------91:36----------
able to go if you think about okay for


---------91:39----------
Who am I getting my teeth replaced


---------91:42----------
because if I'm getting them replaced for


---------91:44----------
me


---------91:45----------
it's not worth like like what I would


---------91:48----------
encourage you to really think about zach


---------91:50----------
is like right now there are what sounds


---------91:54----------
like tens of thousands if not like over


---------91:57----------
a hundred thousand people that watch you


---------91:59----------
and there is something in their life


---------92:01----------
which is their equivalent of not getting


---------92:03----------
their teeth replaced and what you owe


---------92:06----------
them is for you to get your teeth


---------92:07----------
replaced and then share with them


---------92:09----------
something about your perspective of like


---------92:11----------
even if it's like like you desert like I


---------92:14----------
don't know exactly what that is but I


---------92:15----------
think this is what you must contemplate


---------92:17----------
this isn't logic this is consolation


---------92:19----------
scroll journey huh Joseph Campbell's


---------92:22----------
heroic journey what does that mean the


---------92:24----------
hero that leaves the village and brings


---------92:26----------
the Boone back from the adventure and


---------92:29----------
then he brings it back to the village


---------92:30----------
and empowers the entire village yeah and


---------92:32----------
make them all stronger together so you


---------92:34----------
need to get your [ __ ] teeth fixed


---------92:36----------
yeah because you were giving them an


---------92:39----------
excuse to not fix their marks mm-hmm


---------92:43----------
that's not something you can continue


---------92:45----------
doing anymore


---------92:46----------
that makes a lot of sense yeah that does


---------92:51----------
make Watterson's


---------92:55----------
yeah


---------92:58----------
yes I do


---------93:01----------
I I think that's really what it comes


---------93:03----------
down to is making sure that I can be


---------93:05----------
that that representative and I can be


---------93:07----------
that person it's a mantle that they have


---------93:10----------
given you with their viewership in their


---------93:13----------
time and it's not something that you can


---------93:15----------
afford to disappoint them in and it's


---------93:19----------
not just that it's you know like little


---------93:21----------
bits and pieces of [ __ ] in my stream


---------93:23----------
that I don't have happen in the right


---------93:25----------
way and events that I have just like


---------93:27----------
fallen through and I haven't planned out


---------93:29----------
properly many things like that sure but


---------93:33----------
yeah each of those things be careful


---------93:35----------
because you call it [ __ ] I don't


---------93:37----------
think it's [ __ ] there's another


---------93:39----------
equation there with things that keep you


---------93:41----------
from acting when you say I have trouble


---------93:43----------
fully committing I make plans yeah


---------93:45----------
that's because it's not because you're


---------93:47----------
lazier that you're a [ __ ] it's because


---------93:50----------
there's some complicated process going


---------93:52----------
on there and the general variables are


---------93:54----------
gonna be you versus someone else future


---------93:57----------
and past versus present and negative


---------94:01----------
emotion there are also all kinds of


---------94:03----------
other things but those are the three


---------94:05----------
things that I think like or like I would


---------94:07----------
really encourage you to think about and


---------94:09----------
as you unburden yourself those are the D


---------94:11----------
pops it's like you're you know you're


---------94:13----------
razz debuff like having shame about your


---------94:16----------
life is like having a resurrection


---------94:17----------
debuff and you're just not going to be


---------94:19----------
functioning only yeah right and then


---------94:22----------
there are some things that you can do


---------94:24----------
like eat healthy which is like just like


---------94:26----------
wow like there's like food and potions


---------94:28----------
and stuff that you need to use to


---------94:29----------
prepare for a raid and if you meditate


---------94:31----------
every day occasionally you'll get


---------94:34----------
moments of enlightenment which will give


---------94:35----------
you like an understanding which will


---------94:38----------
just wipe away something that holds you


---------94:40----------
back occasionally yeah but from a


---------94:42----------
neuroscience perspective we can't count


---------94:44----------
on that happening because we haven't


---------94:46----------
figured out how to make that happen yet


---------94:47----------
well we do understand is that even from


---------94:49----------
a neuroscience perspective it's like


---------94:51----------
getting a Stoneskin potent like it's


---------94:53----------
gonna protect you a little bit eating


---------94:56----------
healthy or good circadian rhythm


---------94:58----------
exercise meditation hanging out with


---------95:02----------
other human beings


---------95:03----------
sunlight an absence of substances all of


---------95:08----------
these things are going to be buffs can


---------95:11----------
you explain why whenever I was not stree


---------95:15----------
I would wake up at 10 p.m. and I would


---------95:19----------
play video games all night long into the


---------95:21----------
morning eating fast food and I was


---------95:24----------
completely euphoric


---------95:31----------
yeah so I what do you mean by euphoric I


---------95:34----------
was incredibly happy there's nothing


---------95:37----------
wrong I knew exactly what was gonna


---------95:38----------
happen the day was gonna be great and


---------95:41----------
the only thing that really pulled me out


---------95:43----------
of that was the like external variables


---------95:46----------
like you know knowing that I like it


---------95:50----------
can't last forever I guess in a way so


---------95:53----------
was euphoria existential or emotional


---------95:57----------
both I think I was doing what I wanted


---------96:01----------
to do so that sounds hedonistic is


---------96:06----------
opposed to existential to me so that


---------96:09----------
sounds like a pleasurable life but yeah


---------96:14----------
overtime would have led to an empty one


---------96:17----------
and that's what I always you know like I


---------96:22----------
had and I completely agree with you


---------96:25----------
because you know like I've told people a


---------96:27----------
lot of times I never really want to grow


---------96:28----------
up etc and people told to me they're


---------96:31----------
like yeah well you don't have to you


---------96:32----------
know you can just do what you always


---------96:34----------
have done and it's like that's true but


---------96:37----------
yeah I know exactly what you're saying


---------96:39----------
is it will lead to emptiness in a long


---------96:41----------
run so here's what I think I think for


---------96:43----------
most people they think about it how long


---------96:45----------
was that time period oh wait three


---------96:49----------
months and before that I mean like there


---------96:51----------
were time periods like that for years


---------96:53----------
but we were happy every day for years


---------96:55----------
every day no not every day but most of


---------96:58----------
no I'm not talking about emotionally I


---------96:59----------
mean like heggs essentially it in what


---------97:03----------
way like can you were you fulfilled


---------97:04----------
during the years that you were doing


---------97:06----------
that fulfilled um yes and no in some


---------97:13----------
ways yes in some ways oh I feel like I


---------97:15----------
wasn't making enough like videos or


---------97:17----------
content I wasn't creating enough yeah so


---------97:20----------
that's yeah so that's where fulfillment


---------97:22----------
comes from so like I want you to


---------97:24----------
understand this there's a different axis


---------97:26----------
and this is what I call spiritual so


---------97:28----------
there's a spiritual happiness with which


---------97:31----------
the Buddha calls Duke which means


---------97:33----------
suffering so he uses the word suffering


---------97:36----------
because suffering is not an emotion


---------97:38----------
right so there's like contentment and


---------97:40----------
suffering which is on one axis and those


---------97:43----------
are above the axis of


---------97:45----------
individual emotions like you can be sad


---------97:49----------
and content and you can be suffering and


---------97:52----------
joyous yeah right there's a laying poor


---------97:56----------
and not be right so so those are


---------97:59----------
different axes so here's what I think


---------98:00----------
about your three months temped I think


---------98:02----------
that most people think about vacations


---------98:05----------
is something that you do for a couple of


---------98:07----------
weeks I think some people take vacations


---------98:09----------
for months and what I'm hearing from


---------98:12----------
your three months in is you are


---------98:13----------
basically on vacation and vacations been


---------98:17----------
four years yeah so you may you may be


---------98:20----------
someone who has a four year vacation


---------98:22----------
right like that's okay like I think it's


---------98:25----------
fine to be hedonistic for a time and


---------98:27----------
enjoy yourself and also to be favored in


---------98:29----------
the will huh not according to my death


---------98:32----------
yeah so I don't think that you were


---------98:34----------
quite as fulfilled as you think you are


---------98:36----------
but I think that it's fine to be


---------98:37----------
hedonist they can fulfilled at the same


---------98:39----------
like I mean that's okay for periods of


---------98:42----------
time like I love it like sometimes I


---------98:44----------
will just let myself go man yeah you


---------98:50----------
know sometimes it's it's an amazing


---------98:52----------
feeling like I'll be like yeah I'm gonna


---------98:54----------
get like I'm gonna eat [ __ ] Taco Bell


---------98:56----------
and I'm gonna play games until like 1:00


---------98:58----------
in the morning


---------98:59----------
and it's awesome because my you know I'd


---------99:02----------
love to do that for weeks at a time but


---------99:03----------
I tend to get a day every now and then


---------99:05----------
but I think it's fine to be hedonistic


---------99:08----------
hedonistic isn't bad like hedonistic and


---------99:11----------
fulfillment is possible but I think it


---------99:13----------
tends to be temporary because I think


---------99:14----------
over time like there's gonna thats gonna


---------99:17----------
decay and then you'll start to feel


---------99:19----------
empty well it's like if you have a day


---------99:21----------
off that's really exciting but if you're


---------99:24----------
unemployed it's not exactly beautiful


---------99:26----------
and yeah right so I think I and so I


---------99:30----------
think I think if we really dig into your


---------99:32----------
four-year period I would be very


---------99:34----------
surprised because I think you also were


---------99:36----------
good at distraction right so you're


---------99:38----------
probably like pretty good at suppressing


---------99:40----------
things so there may have been discomfort


---------99:43----------
or existential dread or look basically


---------99:46----------
suffering yeah that you were distracting


---------99:48----------
yourself from and and you know you kind


---------99:51----------
of it's easy to get confused with like


---------99:53----------
you know eating fast food and playing


---------99:55----------
video games and the dopamine


---------99:58----------
like dopamine is like separate from


---------99:59----------
fulfillment mm-hmm


---------100:01----------
so that's my take on it yeah I think


---------100:05----------
that's probably true I I feel good about


---------100:08----------
it sometimes I think that there's also


---------100:10----------
like a degree where it's like you do


---------100:12----------
that for years and I felt really good


---------100:14----------
doing it like 19 and 20 and then it was


---------100:17----------
kind of weird whenever I was like 23


---------100:20----------
there's something and still doing it and


---------100:22----------
like I had had like jobs like off and on


---------100:25----------
but for the most part I pretty much did


---------100:28----------
nothing and I went to college and I have


---------100:30----------
a college degree but I mean I didn't


---------100:33----------
really ever give a [ __ ] about that I


---------100:34----------
mainly did that just to get my dad not


---------100:36----------
to get mad at me and I guess yeah I feel


---------100:41----------
ya it would be something that I kind of


---------100:44----------
just would do in order to like forget


---------100:48----------
about things and then every once in a


---------100:50----------
while would take a peek in like the real


---------100:51----------
world we're like I was in like my time


---------100:53----------
capsule of existence yeah it's like yeah


---------100:56----------
my friends are now like they have a


---------100:58----------
house or that you know back then they


---------101:00----------
had like you know now you're graduating


---------101:01----------
college and for me I'm not really or at


---------101:04----------
that time and you know I'm just kind of


---------101:06----------
clowning around and I'd feel like other


---------101:08----------
people were moving forward with their


---------101:10----------
lives and doing things that you know


---------101:12----------
we're meaningful and meanwhile I was


---------101:14----------
just stuck there playing video games and


---------101:16----------
even though I had chosen that there's a


---------101:19----------
there's like a certain I don't know like


---------101:21----------
sadness yeah so I think that it's right


---------101:25----------
at the edges right it's there but right


---------101:28----------
at the edges so I would I wouldn't be


---------101:30----------
surprised if it wasn't at the edges when


---------101:33----------
you do two or three month vacation I


---------101:34----------
think it like you can still feel


---------101:35----------
fulfilled but I know I was the same way


---------101:37----------
like I wouldn't trade it for anything


---------101:39----------
like I remember my third or fourth year


---------101:42----------
of college I was there for five years


---------101:43----------
cuz I failed a bunch of classes but my


---------101:46----------
third or fourth year I remember my


---------101:47----------
friends had a had a house and I I stayed


---------101:51----------
at the frat I mean I lived in a frat


---------101:52----------
house but like they were used to game


---------101:55----------
together and I would basically like go


---------101:57----------
there everyday like I would get up in


---------101:59----------
the morning like I was gonna go to class


---------102:00----------
but I only had classes like three days a


---------102:02----------
week but I would get up at the same time


---------102:04----------
and I was somewhat functional then and I


---------102:07----------
would go to their house at 8:00 in the


---------102:09----------
morning


---------102:09----------
I brought my PC over there


---------102:11----------
I still remember I had never had coffee


---------102:12----------
from a coffee pot like a like a drip


---------102:15----------
coffee machine yeah for whatever reason


---------102:16----------
like I you know I just you know I didn't


---------102:19----------
grow up drinking it or anything and so


---------102:21----------
then like I still remember how delicious


---------102:22----------
their coffee was I would like go to


---------102:24----------
their house at eight in the morning I


---------102:25----------
would make myself a cup of coffee and it


---------102:27----------
was awesome and then I would start


---------102:29----------
playing video games at like 8 a.m.


---------102:30----------
instead of going class on Tuesdays and


---------102:32----------
Thursdays I would go there and I'd play


---------102:33----------
video games and then a Mazda Monday


---------102:35----------
Wednesday Friday I would like wake up


---------102:37----------
and I would go to class and as soon as I


---------102:39----------
was done I would like finish it like


---------102:40----------
noon or something I'd pick up some kind


---------102:43----------
of food and then I'd go to their house


---------102:44----------
and I'd play video games and I just like


---------102:46----------
lived this amazingly hedonistic


---------102:48----------
lifestyle that was just so much fun we


---------102:50----------
would hang out and ha


---------102:52----------
why'd you stop um and it sounds great


---------102:57----------
yeah I mean I I think I stopped because


---------102:59----------
I couldn't keep doing it because you


---------103:03----------
just knew like eternally yeah so like 50


---------103:06----------
year old around I think I was in fourth


---------103:07----------
year and fifth year old around and then


---------103:09----------
I realized that I basically had when I


---------103:11----------
started my fifth year of college I had


---------103:13----------
two years left I started I I finished my


---------103:17----------
sorry I started my fifth year as a


---------103:20----------
junior and then I was like I just cannot


---------103:23----------
stand like I've been ignoring this for a


---------103:26----------
long time but I can't be a sixth year


---------103:29----------
senior I just can't like fifth five


---------103:31----------
years of colleges of croquet yeah but


---------103:33----------
six years is just [ __ ] pathetic it is


---------103:37----------
I remember I had a friend of mine and he


---------103:39----------
logged on one day in the world of


---------103:41----------
warcraft and he said to us he was like


---------103:44----------
guys I'm quitting and I've been in


---------103:47----------
college for five years I need to get my


---------103:50----------
life together this is ridiculous and I


---------103:52----------
can't keep doing this goodbye and he


---------103:55----------
would before this brag about how he


---------103:57----------
would keep he would retake English one


---------104:00----------
or the psychology when I forgot which


---------104:02----------
one the freshman class so he could hook


---------104:04----------
up with freshmen girls every single


---------104:06----------
semester and like apparently his friend


---------104:09----------
watches my stream and the guys getting


---------104:12----------
married now yeah so in my case it was a


---------104:16----------
girl involved too so I was dating a girl


---------104:19----------
who I was really really into and and and


---------104:23----------
also like she didn't


---------104:24----------
know that like she thought I was gonna


---------104:27----------
be graduating at the end of year five


---------104:29----------
and so like I just couldn't face the


---------104:32----------
shame of like telling her that I'm still


---------104:35----------
not done so I just I mean when it came


---------104:38----------
to that my fifth year I just completely


---------104:39----------
busted my ass and and basically did one


---------104:42----------
year of college each semester so I took


---------104:45----------
like twice a normal course load and just


---------104:47----------
so gained actually yeah but you know


---------104:51----------
just I was like that's enough like I


---------104:53----------
can't I mean even in the depths of my


---------104:55----------
shame it's just like I can't I can't do


---------104:57----------
that to myself enough is enough


---------105:00----------
yeah yeah I've had kind of the same


---------105:03----------
thing happen before whenever I was in


---------105:06----------
high school I think I graduated with the


---------105:08----------
2.5 GPA and I would actually I would not


---------105:13----------
do certain assignments like I like I


---------105:15----------
would get my like the progress report


---------105:17----------
and it would tell me like how much each


---------105:18----------
different assignment would be and like


---------105:20----------
what the grading would be for it and I


---------105:22----------
would math out how to get like an 81 or


---------105:25----------
something like that and I would just


---------105:26----------
plan out which assignments would take


---------105:28----------
the most time and I could put the least


---------105:30----------
amount of effort into and I would like


---------105:31----------
to figure out an equilibrium for that


---------105:33----------
and just not do I've ever didn't as


---------105:34----------
little work as possible


---------105:36----------
there's your laziness yeah it's not


---------105:39----------
laziness its efficiency that was very


---------105:42----------
efficient right didn't do a [ __ ]


---------105:44----------
thing yep yeah and so I don't know like


---------105:49----------
I I think that's the problem is like I


---------105:52----------
do get rewarded for the laziness Sherman


---------105:54----------
pretty regularly why is that


---------105:57----------
well I mean Bill Gates did say if he


---------106:01----------
wanted a problem done he'd hire a lazy


---------106:03----------
person to do it because they'd come up


---------106:05----------
with an easy solution so here's here's


---------106:08----------
what I think Zac I don't think laziness


---------106:11----------
is a problem I think laziness of the


---------106:13----------
kind that we described in terms of


---------106:15----------
unpacking it and if there are emotional


---------106:17----------
things that are holding back those are


---------106:18----------
problems but I think gamers are [ __ ]


---------106:21----------
brilliant


---------106:21----------
so when I work with videogame addicts


---------106:23----------
what I do is hook them up with


---------106:24----------
internships at MIT I take this guy who


---------106:27----------
has been out like hasn't graduated


---------106:29----------
college and I dumped him in an AI


---------106:31----------
startup at MIT and then I say go for it


---------106:34----------
bro and then like the turnaround is


---------106:37----------
amazing


---------106:39----------
and it's like like we're not like


---------106:42----------
laziness is not a thing and and like I


---------106:46----------
don't think it's a problem that you're


---------106:48----------
lazy and in the truest form of laziness


---------106:50----------
because I think laziness is an umbrella


---------106:52----------
term that covers a lot of these


---------106:55----------
emotional things in future thinking and


---------106:57----------
like fantasy and all this other kind of


---------106:58----------
crap


---------106:59----------
but there is part of it that is just the


---------107:01----------
laziness of efficiency yeah and and I


---------107:05----------
think even in terms of healthy game or


---------107:07----------
like the people like basically everyone


---------107:09----------
who works for us or people better form


---------107:12----------
our community and what happens is like


---------107:14----------
you take these guys who are like rejects


---------107:16----------
and then you you like give them like


---------107:18----------
something to do that challenges them and


---------107:20----------
makes the world a better place and it's


---------107:22----------
amazing what they've accomplished and so


---------107:26----------
I don't know I don't accept you know I


---------107:27----------
think laziness is fantastic like


---------107:30----------
laziness we we are such a lean and mean


---------107:33----------
startup because we're all lazy and we


---------107:35----------
have no resources and it really is


---------107:37----------
amazing like we would have lost so much


---------107:39----------
money if we went the VC route because we


---------107:41----------
would have done stupid things well I'm


---------107:44----------
glad that somebody can see the light you


---------107:47----------
know what's the time like I tell people


---------107:49----------
that and I think that I'm crazy and yeah


---------107:52----------
I I'm very good at being lazy I've


---------107:56----------
gotten I've had 29 years of experience


---------107:58----------
yeah so I yeah so there's a dark side I


---------108:03----------
think to it which is what I'm really


---------108:04----------
trying to temper absolutely so I agree


---------108:07----------
that you don't want to you want to be


---------108:09----------
efficient lazy but you don't want to be


---------108:10----------
umbrella lazy right so like it's not an


---------108:13----------
excuse for not getting your teeth taken


---------108:15----------
care of you know and and it's not an


---------108:18----------
excuse for some things but I think at


---------108:20----------
the end of the day if you want to like


---------108:21----------
eat fast food for a couple months and


---------108:23----------
game for a couple months and like that


---------108:24----------
works out you're not really letting


---------108:26----------
anyone down then by all means do that


---------108:28----------
take a break yeah I think that helps me


---------108:32----------
a lot to just all I kind of mentally


---------108:34----------
reset I I'm not really I'm probably more


---------108:37----------
introverted than I am extroverted and I


---------108:39----------
think my stream kind of fulfills that


---------108:41----------
extroverted need sure and an app that I


---------108:43----------
want to be the introverted


---------108:46----------
you know troll that just lives in this


---------108:48----------
cave and that's about it


---------108:49----------
well yeah anyway so I'm gonna have to


---------108:55----------
wrap up in a little bit like any other


---------108:58----------
questions like I mean I'd love to shoot


---------108:59----------
the [ __ ] with you it's fun but I just


---------109:01----------
want to make sure that we kind of got to


---------109:03----------
the things that you want to do I think


---------109:05----------
that we pretty much covered everything I


---------109:07----------
donate this is like it it's it's like


---------109:10----------
the roots of a problem it's like a


---------109:13----------
massive tree and there's all the


---------109:14----------
branches one changes to the other


---------109:16----------
branches you know my camera not working


---------109:18----------
on stream etc yeah you know that kind of


---------109:21----------
stuff and so I I think that's actually a


---------109:25----------
great way to conceptualize it because I


---------109:26----------
I don't want anyone to think so this is


---------109:28----------
the big problem that people have is they


---------109:29----------
watch stream and then you know they see


---------109:31----------
like asmin gold was had all of his


---------109:33----------
questions answered and they think that


---------109:34----------
you're fixed they think that what we do


---------109:37----------
on stream is we fix people we're not fix


---------109:39----------
it like we haven't fixed you we're just


---------109:41----------
all we've given you is a road map and


---------109:43----------
you've taken one step and each of those


---------109:46----------
branches needs to be dealt with like


---------109:48----------
that's when you're fixed yeah I I think


---------109:52----------
that's true I mean there's no it's more


---------109:55----------
or less giving somebody a tool but they


---------109:57----------
have to do the job absolutely


---------109:59----------
so speaking of tools sometimes I teach


---------110:01----------
people how to meditate on stream are you


---------110:03----------
interested in that sure what's doing let


---------110:08----------
me just think about if there's a death


---------110:09----------
oriented meditation we can do I


---------110:14----------
I really love I've gained some of my


---------110:17----------
most understanding that I have from the


---------110:20----------
techniques around death and you know


---------110:23----------
earlier when I was saying like when we


---------110:24----------
were talking about death and like where


---------110:26----------
knowledge comes from I've had some


---------110:27----------
really amazing experiences around white


---------110:30----------
life and death when it comes to


---------110:31----------
meditating I'm just trying to think


---------110:33----------
about you know what can I teach you that


---------110:35----------
will prepare you for learning a death


---------110:37----------
oriented technique


---------110:48----------
okay so I'm gonna teach you something do


---------110:50----------
you meditate uh not not consciously no


---------110:55----------
okay I mean what-what do you mean by not


---------111:01----------
consciously then what what do you do


---------111:02----------
sometimes I just sit there and I think


---------111:05----------
about things and I kind of let my mind


---------111:07----------
wander and you know you you just you


---------111:11----------
think about so many it's kind of like


---------111:15----------
cascading uh I guess like series of


---------111:20----------
importances and your wife and you're


---------111:21----------
like thinking about less and less and


---------111:23----------
less important things until you're just


---------111:25----------
not thinking about anything okay that


---------111:30----------
sounds pretty good


---------111:36----------
okay so I'm going to teach you something


---------111:37----------
that we've taught oh let me think about


---------111:40----------
this


---------111:47----------
you


---------111:53----------
so we're gonna do just a quick


---------111:55----------
diagnostic test why are you laughing


---------111:59----------
listen AFK of your brain go afk um so


---------112:04----------
yeah I'm gonna I'm gonna do a quick


---------112:07----------
diagnostic test and then based on that


---------112:10----------
I'm gonna teach you one of two


---------112:11----------
techniques okay all right so one eye so


---------112:19----------
close your eyes and I want you to notice


---------112:22----------
the breath in your nostrils and can you


---------112:28----------
tell if one nostril is more open than


---------112:31----------
the other miraculously they seem to be


---------112:34----------
the same but if I had to guess I'd say


---------112:36----------
the left one is more open yeah okay so


---------112:40----------
pay attention to it for a second and


---------112:41----------
check yeah yeah it's more of a left one


---------112:47----------
that's one of them okay now what I want


---------112:50----------
you to do is imagine your left nostril


---------112:54----------
like a circle okay


---------112:57----------
and


---------113:04----------
and what I want you to do is see if the


---------113:06----------
breath has a certain direction within


---------113:11----------
your left nostril like it's all going to


---------113:15----------
be pointing out but is it stronger at


---------113:17----------
the tip versus kind of where your


---------113:20----------
nostril hits you're like meets your face


---------113:22----------
towards the middle of your nose or the


---------113:24----------
outside of your nose does that leave me


---------113:28----------
yeah the the towards the face and middle


---------113:31----------
face and middle okay so like if we were


---------113:34----------
to think about your nostril as a clock


---------113:36----------
face with 12 o'clock being the tip does


---------113:40----------
that make sense to you does that analogy


---------113:43----------
make sense or mmm 7:00 p.m. okay perfect


---------113:47----------
so this is a good mystery medication


---------113:48----------
right so yeah just sit up straight okay


---------113:54----------
so oh man okay so just notice that for a


---------113:58----------
second could just keep noticing while I


---------114:00----------
try to figure out what to teach you next


---------114:02----------
so this is a good diagnosis okay so this


---------114:06----------
does work right so my instincts were


---------114:08----------
spot-on but now what do I do


---------114:18----------
you


---------114:41----------
okay so now what I want you to do just


---------114:44----------
keep keep your eyes closed I'm gonna


---------114:45----------
describe a couple of things I don't know


---------114:47----------
if you're gonna be able to do it today


---------114:48----------
okay I'm gonna give you sort of a lot to


---------114:50----------
work on okay so the first thing that I


---------114:53----------
want you to think about for a moment is


---------114:55----------
that there's a difference between lazy


---------114:58----------
Zac and moment of enlightenment Zac that


---------115:05----------
the lazier you are the more Zac you are


---------115:08----------
the more asmin gold you are and in


---------115:11----------
moment of enlightenment you're not


---------115:14----------
really that same person does that make


---------115:18----------
sense yeah okay so now what I want you


---------115:23----------
to do is pay attention to the person


---------115:25----------
that you are when your breath is at a


---------115:30----------
particular o'clock position okay and and


---------115:36----------
what I want you to do is throughout the


---------115:38----------
day notice which of your nostrils is


---------115:41----------
open and then notice which o'clock


---------115:49----------
position you're at and see if you can


---------115:51----------
discover any differences in the person


---------115:54----------
that you are depending or correlating


---------115:57----------
with which which o'clock position and


---------116:00----------
which nostril is open okay okay so it's


---------116:05----------
not something we can do today because


---------116:07----------
you're gonna have to collect a lot buddy


---------116:09----------
yes it's very longitude and then I want


---------116:13----------
you to the first axis that I'll give you


---------116:15----------
but by all means explore other things


---------116:17----------
like you can explore your emotional


---------116:19----------
state and things like that but the main


---------116:20----------
axis that I think I want you to really


---------116:22----------
pay attention to is is the axis of like


---------116:29----------
moment of enlightenment versus like


---------116:31----------
apathy it's like detachment versus


---------116:34----------
apathy it's like laziness versus being


---------116:37----------
able to do or whatever you want to


---------116:39----------
future versus present like any kind of


---------116:42----------
axes that you want to just try to pick


---------116:44----------
an axis and I think the most important


---------116:46----------
one is is the one that's like moment of


---------116:50----------
enlightenment versus like lazy Zach


---------116:54----------
and then the last thing that I want you


---------116:57----------
to do which will give you it can kind of


---------116:59----------
anchor your practice is do you live can


---------117:02----------
you see the Sun can you see the sunset


---------117:05----------
or sunrise where you live hmm almost


---------117:10----------
yeah okay so if you can try to figure


---------117:13----------
out when sunrise and sunset are and like


---------117:16----------
for 10 minutes before sunrise in ten


---------117:19----------
minutes before sunset no let's say five


---------117:21----------
minutes before I want you to try to go


---------117:23----------
outside and do this practice and just


---------117:26----------
notice what happens and then the last


---------117:30----------
piece of the practice that I'll give you


---------117:32----------
I'm giving you normally these things are


---------117:34----------
done sequentially last piece of the


---------117:36----------
practice that I'll give you is try to


---------117:38----------
figure out so I'll just leave you with


---------117:43----------
this is as you start to understand what


---------117:46----------
is constant and what is changing about


---------117:49----------
you I think you'll start to understand


---------117:52----------
more about death but that okay okay all


---------118:03----------
right could take a while so that things


---------118:06----------
are to notice you know which nostril is


---------118:08----------
open in which part of the clock your


---------118:11----------
breath is going in you can do that


---------118:13----------
several times a day I would even


---------118:15----------
encourage you to like use a journal or


---------118:16----------
something to take notes and try to feel


---------118:18----------
who you are in those moments and then


---------118:21----------
five minutes before sunrise in five


---------118:22----------
minutes before sunset whenever you can


---------118:24----------
manage it go outside and then just pay


---------118:27----------
attention to who you are


---------118:29----------
and what I'll kind of leave you with is


---------118:32----------
that there will be some parts of you


---------118:34----------
that would fluctuate in some parts of


---------118:36----------
you that may stay the same and try to


---------118:38----------
just try to understand that what about


---------118:41----------
you fluctuates and what about you stays


---------118:42----------
the same okay that makes sense so now


---------118:49----------
let's check in for a second and notice


---------118:50----------
the breath again are we still working


---------118:52----------
with left area we see the left gang yes


---------118:57----------
we were still left again


---------118:58----------
are we still seven o'clock yeah okay so


---------119:03----------
just see when that changes try to check


---------119:05----------
in an hour okay okay right sounds good I


---------119:10----------
can do that yeah all right that's an


---------119:14----------
interesting way to look at it you know


---------119:16----------
it's a level of awareness that I'm not


---------119:20----------
used to having yeah I'll say that sure


---------119:22----------
yeah good yeah I probably I'm gonna use


---------119:26----------
that almost to try to sleep anyway I


---------119:28----------
think that's a good idea focused on very


---------119:30----------
small things that you know are kind of


---------119:33----------
relevant I feel like helps me you know


---------119:35----------
sleep sure yeah okay well is that is


---------119:40----------
that how is that the meditation that I


---------119:42----------
should do yep okay yeah I will try and


---------119:44----------
do that all right yeah cool man


---------119:46----------
any um go ahead sorry no you can I'm


---------119:50----------
just gonna say like any last thoughts or


---------119:52----------
questions or any I'm curious too I mean


---------119:55----------
what did you think about our time


---------119:56----------
together I thought it was really helpful


---------119:59----------
I think the breaking down like all the


---------120:01----------
different components to how you know


---------120:04----------
laziness manifests itself and what the


---------120:07----------
different tricks your mind plays on you


---------120:10----------
and you know the you know the kind of


---------120:13----------
like laziness and efficiency being two


---------120:15----------
sides of the same coin


---------120:16----------
absolutely and that that metaphor I


---------120:19----------
think was really helpful and I do really


---------120:22----------
think that you do good work here on


---------120:24----------
Twitch and that's why I was I was very


---------120:26----------
eager to come on and and and help be a


---------120:29----------
part of it I think this is something


---------120:30----------
that's really important and I think


---------120:33----------
everybody here is very thankful for that


---------120:36----------
including myself thank you yeah well I


---------120:39----------
appreciate I really appreciate you


---------120:41----------
coming on and it's a minute you're just


---------120:42----------
a really like thoughtful guy and and


---------120:45----------
it's it's it's a pleasure to speak with


---------120:46----------
you and kind of you know work with you I


---------120:48----------
I think I've given you maybe you know if


---------120:50----------
you need some help around the meditation


---------120:52----------
technique let me know because I kind of


---------120:53----------
dumped a lot on your plate usually I


---------120:55----------
teach something a little bit more


---------120:56----------
discreet and just tell them you know


---------120:58----------
focus on this thing but I think you'll


---------121:00----------
be able I think you'll like this


---------121:01----------
technique a lot yeah thank you very much


---------121:03----------
and yeah good luck to you and and I


---------121:06----------
really do hope or uoq are you okay with


---------121:09----------
can I put a burden or expectation on you


---------121:13----------
and can we recognize that that could add


---------121:16----------
to the plus or it could add to the mine


---------121:18----------
side of the column sure go ahead and and


---------121:22----------
that's that I think you need to get your


---------121:23----------
teeth fixed yes I this I have a


---------121:27----------
temporary tooth and honestly like I need


---------121:30----------
to get that fixed and I've been kind of


---------121:32----------
hoping that after the quarantine is over


---------121:34----------
I would do that and so I think that now


---------121:37----------
it's it's getting pretty close to that


---------121:40----------
time and III need to fix some of them


---------121:43----------
because I'm worried that they'll fall


---------121:45----------
into the category of needing to be


---------121:46----------
pulled or whatever very soon yeah so


---------121:49----------
this is uh this is something that weighs


---------121:51----------
definitely on my mind and and one last


---------121:53----------
thought that I have is that if you're


---------121:54----------
you know time passes and over there's an


---------121:58----------
acceptable amount of time that can pass


---------122:00----------
and if if there's an unacceptable time


---------122:03----------
that passes before you get it fixed


---------122:05----------
then maybe we should have another


---------122:08----------
conversation yeah I can see that okay so


---------122:13----------
like today we've talked about the route


---------122:15----------
maybe one day we'll talk about one of


---------122:17----------
the branches yeah


---------122:19----------
all right that makes sense okay yeah


---------122:22----------
thank you very much thank you Anna


---------122:24----------
yeah I look forward to that if it


---------122:27----------
happens but I hopefully in Korea yeah


---------122:29----------
hopefully I'll be able to fix it


---------122:31----------
thank you very much I really take care


---------122:33----------
of I talk to other piece alrighty okay


---------122:40----------
so that was fun


---------122:54----------
yeah I understand like you know so


---------122:56----------
people used to call it hasn't been gold


---------122:58----------
the raid boss my god I don't I don't see


---------123:03----------
it what do y'all think he's a good guy


---------123:11----------
man all these guys are good guys


---------123:13----------
everyone's saying Mitt Jones and it


---------123:15----------
shows this great dude


---------123:16----------
like I saw it


---------123:20----------
Ellis is fantastic too I'm like I know


---------123:24----------
that these people have had trouble but


---------123:27----------
like I mean we all have struggles but


---------123:28----------
like there's such solid people dude I


---------123:30----------
don't know I don't know what you know I


---------123:37----------
I don't know I just don't see it okay so


---------123:40----------
listen guys thank you guys very much for


---------123:42----------
coming on thank you guys hopefully that


---------123:44----------
was helpful um it's interesting we've


---------123:46----------
been doing a lot of you know I feel like


---------123:47----------
I've been doing a lot of like teaching


---------123:49----------
mode recently in terms of pulling out


---------123:52----------
the iPad and drawing out diagrams and


---------123:54----------
stuff I apologize for my handwriting but


---------123:56----------
hopefully it's helpful and I think


---------123:57----------
sometimes it's useful to you know see


---------123:59----------
things on paper and yeah and I want I


---------124:04----------
would you know really ask you guys to


---------124:06----------
think a little bit about what we


---------124:08----------
unpacked with laziness and like don't


---------124:10----------
just judge yourself for being lazy like


---------124:12----------
cuz that's gonna contribute to the shame


---------124:14----------
which in turn is gonna increase your


---------124:17----------
perception of laziness it's gonna move


---------124:19----------
you towards inaction


---------124:20----------
right that's what laziness that when we


---------124:22----------
say oh I'm lazy what that means is that


---------124:24----------
you don't act and inaction is not like


---------124:28----------
it's not a personality trait it's like a


---------124:30----------
behavioral equation and understand what


---------124:34----------
the components of your behavioral


---------124:35----------
equation are and work on them because


---------124:37----------
something magical will happen like


---------124:38----------
that's how people like you know it's


---------124:40----------
weird to say like someone turned their


---------124:41----------
life around like how the [ __ ] does that


---------124:42----------
work what's how does that work like


---------124:44----------
there's some system behind turning your


---------124:46----------
life around it's not randomness right


---------124:47----------
there's science and laws of at least


---------124:52----------
neuroscience and physics and and


---------124:54----------
whatever like maybe psychology maybe


---------124:57----------
sociology but there's an order like


---------125:00----------
we're human beings and there's like a


---------125:02----------
way that we work we have a controller


---------125:03----------
and if we learn how to use the buttons


---------125:05----------
then we can do what we want without a


---------125:08----------
character and I think what laziness is


---------125:10----------
is an inability to understand what your


---------125:13----------
buttons do like you don't know how you


---------125:14----------
work and so like no wonder you can't do


---------125:17----------
the things that you want to be able to


---------125:18----------
do but like I need to do it yeah but


---------125:21----------
what are the reasons that you're not


---------125:22----------
doing it right because there are good


---------125:23----------
reasons and the problem is that people


---------125:25----------
ask the question Oh what are the reasons


---------125:27----------
that I'm not doing it and then they say


---------125:29----------
I don't have any good reasons but that's


---------125:31----------
incorrect if you're not doing it


---------125:34----------
that's a data point that signifies that


---------125:36----------
you have a good reason to not do it


---------125:38----------
you just have to find what that reason


---------125:40----------
is and then you can dismantle it


---------125:41----------
it's the invalidation of your reasons to


---------125:46----------
not do something that prevents you from


---------125:47----------
actually doing it because you say oh I'm


---------125:49----------
done


---------125:50----------
like I'm just lazy like I don't have a


---------125:51----------
good reason like if someone asks you


---------125:54----------
like why don't you get your teeth fixed


---------125:55----------
like Zach's answer is gonna be because


---------125:58----------
I'm lazy that's not a good answer


---------126:00----------
there's like a really good reason why he


---------126:01----------
doesn't get his teeth fixed and you have


---------126:03----------
to really respect what holds you back


---------126:05----------
and just really think about that like


---------126:09----------
you have to respect that which holds you


---------126:12----------
in place because otherwise you're never


---------126:13----------
gonna be able to overcome it it's such a


---------126:16----------
powerful opponent right and you guys


---------126:18----------
start by like disrespecting your


---------126:21----------
opponent and then you doom yourself to


---------126:22----------
failure respect what holds you back


---------126:24----------
respect that if you're going nowhere in


---------126:26----------
life there's a damn good reason for it


---------126:28----------
and then once you like treat it with the


---------126:30----------
respect that it deserves then you're


---------126:32----------
gonna be way better at dealing with it


---------126:36----------
respect your problems and respect


---------126:38----------
yourselves and thank you guys very much


---------126:42----------
we're gonna take next week off from


---------126:45----------
streaming and then we're gonna do a


---------126:47----------
bunch of DLCs on on Monday the 22nd we


---------126:50----------
