---------00:00----------
so i i know that today's interview was


---------00:02----------
just a little bit different so you know


---------00:03----------
a lot of times when people come on on


---------00:05----------
stream like


---------00:06----------
it's all about negative emotions and and


---------00:09----------
things like that


---------00:10----------
and you know people are crying and


---------00:11----------
whatnot but


---------00:12----------
i think it's important to remember that


---------00:14----------
really the goal of the stream is to be


---------00:15----------
like educational right and help people


---------00:17----------
understand different slices of life and


---------00:20----------
a lot of times those slices of life are


---------00:22----------
a little bit negative but it's


---------00:23----------
interesting because a lot of the


---------00:24----------
questions we get are like how do i do


---------00:27----------
this like how do i become successful how


---------00:29----------
do i understand the flow state how do i


---------00:31----------
enter the flow state how do i you know


---------00:33----------
what what are the pieces of that and the


---------00:35----------
really interesting thing about lyle is


---------00:37----------
um i think he's he's done a good job of


---------00:39----------
like stumbling on a lot of this stuff


---------00:41----------
through his own


---------00:42----------
explorations and so


---------00:45----------
it's really more a little bit


---------00:46----------
about understanding the flow state like


---------00:48----------
how to do creative work how to be a


---------00:50----------
little bit successful by carving out


---------00:52----------
your own niche


---------00:54----------
and those are all like important topics


---------00:55----------
for people as well so i know that


---------00:57----------
sometimes it's not quite as you know


---------00:59----------
entertaining


---------01:00----------
in terms of like voyeurism but hopefully


---------01:02----------
it was helpful to people who are curious


---------01:04----------
about this kind of stuff


---------01:08----------
anyway welcome friend


---------01:11----------
thank you for having me


---------01:12----------
thank you for coming on i see you are uh


---------01:15----------
you appear to be a gecko


---------01:17----------
i i i do appear to be a gecko i uh i


---------01:20----------
spent like while you were running late i


---------01:21----------
actually i was glad you were running


---------01:22----------
late because it gave me some time to


---------01:24----------
like i was trying to screw around with


---------01:25----------
my uh background because i normally have


---------01:27----------
like


---------01:28----------
clouds or outer space or something but


---------01:31----------
uh


---------01:32----------
it didn't work


---------01:34----------
yeah so um can you tell me what you go


---------01:36----------
by like what do you want me to call you


---------01:38----------
should i call you


---------01:39----------
yeah


---------01:40----------
how do i you he's you can you can just


---------01:42----------
call me lyle that works okay lyle yeah


---------01:45----------
so tell me a little bit um you know do


---------01:47----------
you have a is there a particular topic


---------01:49----------
that we're talking about today or um


---------01:52----------
you know something in particular that


---------01:55----------
interests you


---------01:58----------
i don't know i guess the


---------02:00----------
there's like a sort of


---------02:02----------
maybe it's trite but like the idea of


---------02:05----------
you know what's what's you know if


---------02:07----------
you're a a person who


---------02:10----------
you know talks to people about their


---------02:11----------
problems on the computer it's like what


---------02:13----------
are your problems you know but i don't


---------02:14----------
know that felt cliche


---------02:16----------
to me in a way isn't you asking


---------02:19----------
me what my problems are or i'm asking


---------02:22----------
you what your problems are


---------02:24----------
i guess i guess you asking me what my


---------02:26----------
problems are but i think this is sort of


---------02:28----------
interesting because well i mean you're a


---------02:29----------
real therapist


---------02:31----------
and i'm a gecko


---------02:33----------
guy


---------02:34----------
yeah i mean are you


---------02:36----------
are you not a real therapist


---------02:38----------
no


---------02:39----------
oh okay


---------02:41----------
oh wait did you not know that no i i


---------02:43----------
wasn't sure


---------02:44----------
oh okay okay yeah


---------02:46----------
i hope i didn't like yeah i hope i


---------02:48----------
didn't want to feel like i was tricking


---------02:49----------
you


---------02:50----------
no i i mean i i i think you're pretty


---------02:53----------
transparent in in you know that this is


---------02:55----------
a character and an act and at the same


---------02:57----------
time i actually you know have no idea


---------02:59----------
about what your educational background


---------03:01----------
is or things like that so i try not to


---------03:02----------
assume


---------03:03----------
but um if you want to you know talk


---------03:05----------
about or share uh something about maybe


---------03:08----------
things that you struggle with or stuff


---------03:09----------
like that sometimes people like to get a


---------03:10----------
different perspective


---------03:12----------
um


---------03:13----------
and so we can definitely do that


---------03:15----------
a lot of times people will want to talk


---------03:17----------
a little bit about


---------03:18----------
stress related to


---------03:20----------
you know being a particular character i


---------03:22----------
think interestingly enough um you know


---------03:25----------
it's very overt that you or a character


---------03:27----------
might assume once again that lyle once


---------03:30----------
the makeup comes off and the gecko suit


---------03:32----------
comes off that you're a different person


---------03:34----------
but one of the things that i notice with


---------03:36----------
a lot of content creators is that it can


---------03:37----------
be hard because their content creator


---------03:40----------
personality can conflict


---------03:43----------
or almost like even dominate their like


---------03:45----------
real personality and that can be really


---------03:47----------
hard to kind of struggle with


---------03:50----------
um yeah


---------03:52----------
oh it's funny you say that because i


---------03:54----------
actually i don't feel like i am all that


---------03:56----------
uh


---------03:57----------
different


---------03:58----------
uh from who i really i really i mean i


---------04:01----------
feel like every like you know


---------04:03----------
uh you know online persona is just like


---------04:06----------
an exaggerated version of who the person


---------04:08----------
actually is


---------04:09----------
and so i i think that i'm as much of a


---------04:12----------
character


---------04:13----------
i think that the the the being on camera


---------04:15----------
and broadcasting myself


---------04:17----------
is like


---------04:18----------
what would make me a character more so


---------04:20----------
than the fact that i'm wearing a gecko


---------04:24----------
costume i actually i made a i made a


---------04:26----------
pretty intentional like uh decision not


---------04:29----------
to like


---------04:31----------
hammer so hard into a character because


---------04:33----------
like you know it's one thing if you're


---------04:35----------
like you know borat and you're like


---------04:37----------
making a skit for three minutes or


---------04:39----------
something but like if you're streaming


---------04:41----------
for hours and hours and hours a day


---------04:43----------
and i'm you know up there talking about


---------04:45----------
eating bugs or whatever


---------04:47----------
you know that just i feel like that


---------04:48----------
would just have gotten exhausting if i


---------04:50----------
had like committed really hard to like i


---------04:52----------
am a gecko and all that you know


---------04:54----------
yeah so what i'm hearing is that to


---------04:56----------
retain some of your sanity


---------04:58----------
you can't go too far away from being


---------05:01----------
your authentic self


---------05:02----------
yes absolutely


---------05:04----------
yeah that's well said i think it so can


---------05:06----------
you just tell me a little bit lyle about


---------05:08----------
um


---------05:08----------
[Music]


---------05:09----------
so you know if you're okay with it i'll


---------05:11----------
just ask you a couple of questions about


---------05:13----------
how you got to where you are and then if


---------05:15----------
there's something that um maybe we can


---------05:17----------
talk about that would be interesting to


---------05:18----------
you or helpful like by all means


---------05:21----------
um and then if you've got questions for


---------05:22----------
me you know feel free to jump in at any


---------05:25----------
point so can you just tell me a little


---------05:27----------
bit about you know how you got to


---------05:30----------
being a therapy gecko on the internet


---------05:33----------
sure um


---------05:35----------
well


---------05:36----------
it was a quarantine and uh i started um


---------05:40----------
going live on instagram with my friends


---------05:43----------
just sort of


---------05:45----------
screwing around and


---------05:47----------
talking about nothing and like there


---------05:48----------
would be you know two people


---------05:50----------
from my high school watching and uh it


---------05:52----------
was a lot of fun i liked


---------05:54----------
live streaming and i sort of thought


---------05:56----------
like


---------05:57----------
oh i wonder if like i could kind of do


---------05:58----------
this like in front of people who do not


---------06:01----------
know me


---------06:02----------
and uh so i kind of had that thought in


---------06:04----------
the back of my head and then uh


---------06:07----------
so there was that and then i made this


---------06:09----------
other like youtube video uh where i


---------06:13----------
and one of the one of the costumes was


---------06:15----------
was a gecko so i had a gecko costume


---------06:18----------
that's prong too


---------06:20----------
and then uh


---------06:21----------
do you know about reddit streaming like


---------06:24----------
rpan is yeah yeah yeah


---------06:26----------
i know that tries to get me to watch


---------06:28----------
their live stream a lot but


---------06:30----------
yeah everyone hates them the top the top


---------06:32----------
post it's it's a it's called rpan yeah


---------06:35----------
and the top post every week in rpan is


---------06:37----------
how do i disable


---------06:39----------
rpan you know everyone really doesn't


---------06:42----------
like them but uh


---------06:43----------
i i started street i found our pan and i


---------06:45----------
thought it was really interesting in


---------06:47----------
like a cool community because it's it's


---------06:49----------
sort of different from twitch because


---------06:50----------
twitch is like gaming focused and rpan


---------06:52----------
is like


---------06:53----------
more sort of anything um


---------06:56----------
and so the combination of those


---------06:58----------
three things i started streaming on uh


---------07:01----------
reddit as a lizard


---------07:04----------
and and uh posting clips from tick tock


---------07:07----------
and


---------07:08----------
all of a sudden it became


---------07:10----------
what i do to exist


---------07:13----------
wow


---------07:14----------
so how long did it take to become what


---------07:16----------
you do to exist what are we talking


---------07:18----------
about in terms of a journey here


---------07:21----------
fairly quickly uh like you know i i


---------07:24----------
started on um


---------07:27----------
rpan and then i started a i started a


---------07:28----------
twitch like two months


---------07:30----------
after that and my twitch sort of grew


---------07:33----------
enough that it became like a lucrative


---------07:35----------
thing to do and now


---------07:37----------
it's i am i am therapy gecko awesome man


---------07:41----------
so how has how's that journey been for


---------07:44----------
you


---------07:46----------
uh it's been a lot of fun it's been cool


---------07:49----------
um


---------07:50----------
how has it been


---------07:52----------
um it happened really fast i feel very


---------07:54----------
grateful because i know a lot of people


---------07:56----------
like you know i i don't i've only been


---------07:58----------
streaming for like


---------07:59----------
a year and a half and i know that it


---------08:01----------
takes a lot to get a stream off the


---------08:02----------
ground so i feel uh


---------08:04----------
you know grateful that i i was able to


---------08:06----------
kind of make this into a thing pretty


---------08:08----------
pretty fast


---------08:10----------
yeah


---------08:10----------
yeah it's interesting a year and a half


---------08:12----------
i i can't tell if that's really


---------08:14----------
i mean it sounds like on the one hand


---------08:16----------
it's fast right because some people will


---------08:17----------
stream for years and slowly grow and on


---------08:20----------
the other hand it's still like a year


---------08:21----------
and a half of your your life bro


---------08:24----------
yeah that's true that's true yeah so it


---------08:26----------
sounds like you've been working at it


---------08:27----------
for a while and putting in kind of


---------08:29----------
thought and effort


---------08:32----------
yeah and you know i'd been like do i'd


---------08:34----------
been like


---------08:36----------
making things on the internet for


---------08:38----------
like you know since i was like 13 years


---------08:41----------
old you know and i


---------08:43----------
did uh


---------08:44----------
stand up from the time i was like 16


---------08:47----------
to uh like 22. so i'd been like


---------08:50----------
i guess if you could call twitch


---------08:52----------
streaming performing you know performing


---------08:55----------
uh you know


---------08:57----------
for for a while


---------08:59----------
wow that's interesting can you tell me a


---------09:00----------
little bit about what


---------09:02----------
drew you to making things on the


---------09:04----------
internet at the age of 13.


---------09:07----------
uh


---------09:08----------
yeah


---------09:10----------
i guess uh i had this uh like


---------09:13----------
i had this i can't describe it but i had


---------09:15----------
this like


---------09:17----------
internet show thing when i was 13 i


---------09:19----------
called it i weekly and uh i was just


---------09:22----------
ripping off of robot chicken like i


---------09:24----------
would take like


---------09:25----------
little dolls and stuff and like act out


---------09:27----------
little things and then like cut to


---------09:29----------
another little thing with


---------09:31----------
dolls or mcdonald's toys i had


---------09:34----------
lying around that was


---------09:36----------
actually that was when i was in like


---------09:37----------
fifth grade


---------09:39----------
i think


---------09:40----------
and uh i've been pretty much making


---------09:41----------
stuff on the internet since then


---------09:44----------
so what drew you to making stuff on the


---------09:46----------
internet in the fifth grade


---------09:50----------
i don't know i think that that's like a


---------09:51----------
sort of


---------09:52----------
like


---------09:53----------
like pot like every every kid wants to


---------09:56----------
be like an internet star in a way like


---------09:58----------
you would see like fred and


---------10:01----------
smosh and [ __ ] and be like oh that is


---------10:04----------
cool i want to have as many


---------10:05----------
you know youtube subscribers as fred and


---------10:08----------
so you just start making stupid videos


---------10:10----------
on the internet which is interesting


---------10:12----------
because i feel like that's gotten i feel


---------10:13----------
like that's


---------10:15----------
multiplied itself by


---------10:17----------
10 000


---------10:19----------
now with uh you know tick tock and all


---------10:21----------
that


---------10:22----------
yeah so it sounds like you you were you


---------10:25----------
actually like you know you created stuff


---------10:27----------
and you


---------10:28----------
were looking


---------10:30----------
almost like you had a goal in mind right


---------10:31----------
which is that you wanted to be like


---------10:33----------
these people who had


---------10:35----------
a lot of subscribers and and created


---------10:38----------
content and


---------10:41----------
i think so i think so i'm trying to


---------10:45----------
it's so hard i i'm so bad at going into


---------10:47----------
like my past with uh man whatever i i


---------10:50----------
hear people like whenever i hear someone


---------10:51----------
like give a


---------10:52----------
uh uh


---------10:54----------
intricate story about their childhood


---------10:56----------
i'm like how the hell do you remember


---------10:57----------
that i'm like trying to


---------10:58----------
think about what my motivations were


---------11:00----------
when i was in fifth grade and i don't


---------11:02----------
know how deep they were but i that that


---------11:04----------
that that might have that might have


---------11:05----------
been it yeah no i and by the way lyle


---------11:08----------
it's it's completely normal to not have


---------11:11----------
you know not remember what you were


---------11:12----------
thinking in the fifth grade


---------11:15----------
i i thank you


---------11:16----------
thank you you know so like validating


---------11:18----------
that so the interesting thing is if you


---------11:20----------
really look at like memories from our


---------11:22----------
past yeah generally speaking i think um


---------11:26----------
you know the prevailing theory or at


---------11:27----------
least the one that i subscribed to is


---------11:29----------
that most of them were constructed after


---------11:31----------
the fact


---------11:33----------
so like i'm really surprised when my


---------11:35----------
kids will like


---------11:37----------
remember things from when they were i


---------11:39----------
have a four-year-old and a six-year-old


---------11:40----------
so they'll like remember like my


---------11:41----------
six-year-old will remember things from


---------11:43----------
when she was three i don't think she


---------11:45----------
remembers i think she just has heard the


---------11:46----------
stories and so she constructs a memory


---------11:50----------
it's a lot of time


---------11:51----------
yeah so like a lot of times if you


---------11:53----------
really kind of look at it and there's


---------11:55----------
some meditation techniques and stuff


---------11:56----------
around this as well


---------11:58----------
most of what we remember or impressions


---------12:00----------
and then the narrative that you hear


---------12:02----------
people construct or the narrative that


---------12:04----------
you hear people share is actually


---------12:06----------
constructed


---------12:08----------
based on like some kind of memory


---------12:09----------
impression


---------12:11----------
um and there's like a lot of blanks


---------12:13----------
being


---------12:14----------
sort of filled in yeah absolutely so you


---------12:17----------
kind of have like some kind of imprint


---------12:20----------
and then


---------12:21----------
you know like you fill it in


---------12:23----------
and then like human beings try to form


---------12:26----------
narratives about themselves it seems to


---------12:28----------
be incredibly adaptive and so you know


---------12:31----------
at some point you know in your mind


---------12:33----------
you're kind of conceptualizing who you


---------12:35----------
are and how you've become a gecko and


---------12:37----------
what it means to be lyle as a gecko


---------12:41----------
and where is the lile and what is the


---------12:42----------
gecko so i think it's normal to not you


---------12:44----------
know have well-constructed memories


---------12:47----------
um and even


---------12:49----------
even people like myself who will you


---------12:51----------
know tell stories and my stories come


---------12:53----------
across as coherent from my past


---------12:55----------
tend to be like storytelling right it's


---------12:57----------
not like i really i mean i'll have


---------12:59----------
particular memory impressions which are


---------13:01----------
powerful and emotional and then since


---------13:03----------
i'm you know then i'll construct a


---------13:05----------
narrative around that which then makes


---------13:07----------
sense to other people


---------13:09----------
and so you're like exaggerating certain


---------13:11----------
parts of it to fit in to like make a a


---------13:14----------
story


---------13:15----------
i wouldn't say that clear beginning


---------13:16----------
middle and end yeah so i wouldn't call


---------13:18----------
it exaggeration but i'd say that if you


---------13:20----------
really think about it what you're doing


---------13:22----------
is filling in the gaps absolutely right


---------13:24----------
so and our mind does this automatically


---------13:26----------
like as it makes sense of things you'll


---------13:28----------
kind of reinterpret things and then


---------13:30----------
realize oh the reason i did that was


---------13:32----------
because


---------13:33----------
you know so for example like


---------13:35----------
you know the reason i got bullied is


---------13:37----------
maybe because of you know i was a year


---------13:39----------
younger than everyone in my class and


---------13:41----------
everything was related to sports and


---------13:42----------
stuff like that so i was like a


---------13:43----------
five-year-old competing against


---------13:44----------
six-year-olds and so that's the reason


---------13:47----------
that i sucked at sports was because you


---------13:49----------
know a six-year-old will destroy a


---------13:50----------
five-year-old in basically any sport


---------13:53----------
um


---------13:54----------
and as actually i started school when i


---------13:56----------
was four so i was like a four-year-old


---------13:58----------
competing against five-year-olds and so


---------13:59----------
it was like not even a contest


---------14:01----------
and then


---------14:02----------
i can say that no wasn't impressive it


---------14:05----------
was actually i got i got rolled


---------14:07----------
but though it was impressive that you


---------14:09----------
you you were you were four but you


---------14:11----------
decided to do it anyway even if you were


---------14:13----------
scared


---------14:14----------
yeah so you know that that's see there


---------14:16----------
that's kind of interesting what you did


---------14:18----------
there because you said i decided to do


---------14:20----------
it anyway because i was scared so if you


---------14:22----------
say something like that it constructs a


---------14:24----------
narrative of me being impressive


---------14:27----------
but actually what happened is


---------14:29----------
i go to pe i dread pe every single day i


---------14:32----------
don't have a choice i know if i cry i'm


---------14:34----------
gonna get bullied more


---------14:36----------
so it wasn't like a testament to my


---------14:38----------
bravery it was like you know being


---------14:40----------
marched off to the


---------14:42----------
you know like a the noose every single


---------14:45----------
day


---------14:46----------
and so it was it was a harrowing


---------14:48----------
experience but as we kind of put that


---------14:50----------
together even that is sort of like i


---------14:51----------
remember the fear and so what i'll do is


---------14:53----------
like fill in the gaps around it to kind


---------14:55----------
of construct a narrative about my


---------14:57----------
experience


---------14:58----------
right and you can reframe it to say that


---------15:01----------
you were brave


---------15:03----------
sure i mean i i try not to but


---------15:06----------
but yeah absolutely sometimes people


---------15:08----------
will reframe things to make themselves


---------15:10----------
appear better or more noble


---------15:14----------
and in my experience that doesn't


---------15:17----------
actually help and being honest about


---------15:19----------
your negative emotions and when things


---------15:21----------
are hard for you is actually


---------15:23----------
healthier


---------15:24----------
but that's


---------15:26----------
i like that


---------15:28----------
so what do you kind of remember about


---------15:30----------
growing up and what was growing up like


---------15:32----------
for you


---------15:35----------
i grew up


---------15:36----------
in a


---------15:37----------
suburban jewish neighborhood


---------15:40----------
uh


---------15:42----------
we we did i i went to hebrew school


---------15:46----------
uh i went to


---------15:48----------
sleep away camp


---------15:50----------
i was thinking about camp today because


---------15:52----------
like years ago i was at the jewish


---------15:54----------
community center


---------15:56----------
camp


---------15:57----------
that was fun


---------15:58----------
uh i had uh i see my parents divorced


---------16:02----------
when i like 2 000


---------16:05----------
four


---------16:07----------
maybe


---------16:08----------
that was a big that was a that was a big


---------16:10----------
thing


---------16:12----------
um how old were you at the time


---------16:15----------
ah man i was


---------16:17----------
how [ __ ] old was that


---------16:18----------
like young like i had to be like


---------16:20----------
six or seven or something like that


---------16:24----------
okay


---------16:26----------
and you said that was a big thing what


---------16:28----------
does that mean


---------16:31----------
uh i don't know it's just like like i


---------16:32----------
don't like think about it that much


---------16:33----------
because like it doesn't affect me that


---------16:36----------
much in my current life it's something i


---------16:37----------
never think about like you know i know


---------16:39----------
it's like


---------16:40----------
for a lot of families it's devastating


---------16:42----------
but for me it wasn't that like


---------16:44----------
big of a deal i guess but like


---------16:46----------
i remember like i just i just remember


---------16:50----------
like that being a


---------16:52----------
big thing when it happened which i guess


---------16:55----------
makes sense in a way


---------16:58----------
i know this may sound like kind of a


---------16:59----------
weird question lyle but in what way was


---------17:02----------
it a big thing


---------17:04----------
uh


---------17:06----------
i don't know maybe i just said that


---------17:09----------
i i i don't have like a


---------17:11----------
it i guess it wasn't a big thing now


---------17:13----------
that i think about it so let's let's


---------17:16----------
learn for a second okay so i'm going to


---------17:18----------
make an observation okay


---------17:20----------
so do it


---------17:22----------
remember we said that when you're young


---------17:24----------
you have just impressions


---------17:26----------
but when i ask you about it you don't


---------17:28----------
have clear memories and so before you


---------17:31----------
walk yourself back from the big thing


---------17:34----------
chances are the only impression that you


---------17:36----------
got left with was that it was big


---------17:39----------
right which is


---------17:40----------
literally exactly what we were just


---------17:42----------
talking about and so if i ask you about


---------17:43----------
it and you're not able to provide


---------17:44----------
answers it doesn't mean it wasn't a big


---------17:46----------
thing it just means you were


---------17:48----------
six


---------17:50----------
yes and so like what are you gonna


---------17:51----------
remember that is correct the


---------17:53----------
complexities of why your parents get


---------17:55----------
divorced when you're six that is correct


---------17:58----------
it was a big thing i can't dive further


---------18:01----------
into it because i was sick and have


---------18:03----------
like i cannot form other words to say


---------18:06----------
sure that creates


---------18:08----------
it


---------18:09----------
but i i but i remember like when i was


---------18:11----------
you know i mean it was a big thing in my


---------18:12----------
family like when i was like


---------18:14----------
you know by the time that both of my


---------18:16----------
parents had remarried it was like


---------18:18----------
i mean it was actually kind of a great


---------18:19----------
thing in a way because i mean the


---------18:22----------
circumstances of it


---------18:24----------
uh you know might not been as great but


---------18:25----------
like it ended up being good because they


---------18:27----------
they my my mom and my dad are not


---------18:30----------
very uh


---------18:32----------
like compatible with each other they're


---------18:34----------
kind of polar opposites


---------18:36----------
so it's kind of it's good that they


---------18:39----------
remarried to other people got it so it


---------18:42----------
sounds like it ended for the best


---------18:45----------
ended for the best exactly yeah


---------18:47----------
so just to think a little bit about


---------18:50----------
constructing narratives so we're gonna


---------18:52----------
toss out a couple of things okay let's


---------18:54----------
do it so you remember how you were kind


---------18:56----------
of saying that


---------18:57----------
people will


---------18:58----------
reinterpret things and make themselves


---------19:01----------
potentially feel braver right we'll tell


---------19:03----------
ourselves tell ourselves stories that


---------19:06----------
result in like positivity and the


---------19:08----------
reframing of negative things into


---------19:09----------
positive things


---------19:10----------
yeah yeah


---------19:12----------
so a very common thing that i hear have


---------19:14----------
no idea if this is actually the case


---------19:16----------
with you but just for something for you


---------19:17----------
to think about is oftentimes divorce


---------19:19----------
sucks for kids


---------19:22----------
and sometimes what children will do is


---------19:25----------
in order to kind of smooth everything


---------19:28----------
over and not be angry and resentful to


---------19:30----------
our parents for throwing our life into


---------19:32----------
chaos at the age of six


---------19:34----------
what we'll do is the whole family will


---------19:37----------
share and construct a narrative of it's


---------19:39----------
for the best because mom and dad are


---------19:41----------
both happier now and it's good to have


---------19:42----------
happy parents for happy kids


---------19:45----------
and and i'm not saying that that's right


---------19:47----------
or wrong or or whatever it's just a


---------19:49----------
common pattern that i've seen that a lot


---------19:51----------
of people will kind of reinterpret


---------19:53----------
things in that way and i'm not talking


---------19:55----------
because i have no idea what exactly


---------19:56----------
happened with your parents or anything


---------19:58----------
like that sure but it's just such a


---------20:00----------
common occurrence for us to say oh like


---------20:02----------
divorce actually was for the best like


---------20:03----------
sometimes you know


---------20:05----------
i i will say things about that in terms


---------20:07----------
of my life like i'll say like oh you


---------20:09----------
know failing out of college was a really


---------20:10----------
formative experience for me and made me


---------20:12----------
who i am which is absolutely true


---------20:15----------
but yeah also it was awful


---------20:18----------
like it was a terrible experience to go


---------20:20----------
through yeah sure


---------20:22----------
i will say


---------20:24----------
i


---------20:25----------
i do believe that the


---------20:27----------
uh


---------20:28----------
idea that everything happened the best


---------20:30----------
is something i genuinely decided


---------20:33----------
on my own i don't think it was like uh


---------20:36----------
like i i wouldn't i don't i i don't look


---------20:37----------
at it at all as like a narrative i


---------20:39----------
crafted to like have to deal with like


---------20:41----------
you know i totally think that it was it


---------20:42----------
was for the i mean i don't think like


---------20:45----------
yeah i i don't remember like uh you know


---------20:47----------
i don't i don't really have like any


---------20:50----------
it's not it's not a tragic


---------20:52----------
sort of part of my life or anything like


---------20:54----------
that i genuinely truly do believe it's


---------20:56----------
it was it was for the best and can you


---------20:58----------
help me understand how you came to that


---------21:00----------
genuine decision


---------21:02----------
oh yeah i mean i just i mean just


---------21:03----------
looking up who my parents like you know


---------21:05----------
just looking at who they're with now


---------21:07----------
yeah versus like like versus like each


---------21:09----------
other like


---------21:10----------
their spouses are who they're currently


---------21:12----------
married to are like


---------21:14----------
you know and any anyone could look at


---------21:16----------
them and say objectively they are much


---------21:17----------
better with the people they are with now


---------21:19----------
than uh the people that they you know


---------21:21----------
each other


---------21:22----------
so i'm hearing that you're you're both


---------21:24----------
your parents married far more compatible


---------21:26----------
people


---------21:27----------
oh for sure


---------21:28----------
and so as a result you know it's like a


---------21:31----------
no-brainer that they're like with


---------21:32----------
compatible people and being in a


---------21:34----------
relationship with someone that you're


---------21:35----------
compatible with is objectively better


---------21:37----------
than being someone in a relationship


---------21:39----------
with someone that you're not compatible


---------21:40----------
with which makes perfect


---------21:42----------
and it doesn't have to be some kind of


---------21:44----------
weird psychological


---------21:46----------
re you know retelling of history or


---------21:48----------
anything like that it's just like


---------21:49----------
honestly yeah exactly they just weren't


---------21:51----------
right for each other and they found yeah


---------21:52----------
i almost i feel like i feel nerve like


---------21:55----------
not nervous about this but like i do i


---------21:57----------
you know


---------21:58----------
when talking to you i i wanna i'm trying


---------22:01----------
to be conscious about like like in my


---------22:03----------
like i like my parents divorce is not


---------22:05----------
like a big like i i don't believe that


---------22:07----------
like


---------22:08----------
we would go down this whole


---------22:10----------
rabbit hole that would be like oh my


---------22:12----------
parents divorce is actually the root of


---------22:13----------
my entire problem i i genuinely don't


---------22:15----------
believe that i'm trying not to


---------22:18----------
talk in a way that would lead us down


---------22:20----------
that rabbit hole because i don't think


---------22:21----------
it would be


---------22:22----------
i don't think it would lead anywhere


---------22:24----------
yeah sure so what do you think


---------22:27----------
somewhere


---------22:28----------
i don't know


---------22:29----------
i thought i was kind of you know i you


---------22:31----------
know what's i thought was kind of funny


---------22:33----------
is that i was uh i was like watching


---------22:35----------
some of your stuff


---------22:36----------
uh i'm a fan i was watching to like


---------22:39----------
prepare to come here and i heard you


---------22:41----------
were talking to a


---------22:42----------
poke you were talking to pokemane


---------22:45----------
and you said you asked her what you


---------22:46----------
should you should call her


---------22:48----------
and uh you said like poke she's like


---------22:50----------
pokeman is more of a character and you


---------22:51----------
said you don't like characters


---------22:54----------
and i was like oh i'm about to show up


---------22:55----------
on this guy's stream he hates characters


---------22:57----------
i'm gonna show up


---------22:59----------
as a gekko


---------23:02----------
and


---------23:04----------
what was the conclusion that your mind


---------23:06----------
came to from that


---------23:08----------
i don't know


---------23:10----------
i think


---------23:11----------
but i don't know i'm not really i guess


---------23:12----------
we already sort of talked about this but


---------23:14----------
i'm not really like a


---------23:16----------
character


---------23:17----------
or anything


---------23:18----------
is it important for you to show up in a


---------23:20----------
way that i would like


---------23:26----------
uh i


---------23:28----------
i guess so i mean i don't wanna i did i


---------23:30----------
didn't think i was gonna piss you off by


---------23:32----------
showing up as a gecko


---------23:34----------
but


---------23:36----------
yeah would it be okay if you did piss me


---------23:39----------
off


---------23:42----------
i'd like to not piss you off i


---------23:44----------
appreciate that feeling is mutual


---------23:48----------
and


---------23:49----------
would it be okay if it did piss me off


---------23:54----------
i think i could i think i could get over


---------23:55----------
it if i if i pissed you off


---------23:57----------
yeah i don't want to piss you off but i


---------24:00----------
don't i wouldn't


---------24:02----------
it wouldn't destroy me if i pissed you


---------24:04----------
off yeah and i i'm i'm happy to hear


---------24:06----------
that because i think you know we're not


---------24:08----------
here for you to make me happy


---------24:10----------
sure that's not why we're here


---------24:13----------
and i'd say if you pissed me off i'd say


---------24:15----------
like you know me getting pissed off is


---------24:17----------
more on me now if you're acting in a way


---------24:18----------
that's like toxic or disrespectful or


---------24:20----------
malicious then i think that is fair to


---------24:23----------
blame but i mean you get to come on here


---------24:25----------
in whatever way you want to


---------24:27----------
sure right and if i don't like it


---------24:30----------
that's something i have to deal with


---------24:31----------
it's not your responsibility


---------24:33----------
yeah i agree with i feel like if if if


---------24:36----------
for whatever if if me wearing a gecko


---------24:37----------
suit i didn't i don't i don't think i


---------24:39----------
really genuinely thought i would i was


---------24:41----------
gonna piss you off but even but like


---------24:43----------
that's the thing is if i did if me


---------24:45----------
wearing a gecko suit really did piss you


---------24:47----------
off that i'd that would that i agree


---------24:49----------
that would be a you problem yeah


---------24:52----------
all the more power to you dude i'm


---------24:54----------
thrilled the only real concern i have


---------24:55----------
about the gecko suit is i'm curious


---------24:57----------
about whether the makeup is you know


---------24:59----------
safe to wear on a prolonged basis and


---------25:02----------
whether you've dr k i went to a


---------25:04----------
dermatologist i went to a dermatologist


---------25:06----------
dr well done


---------25:08----------
and i and i i went to a dermatologist


---------25:10----------
and i told them that i wear


---------25:13----------
green paint


---------25:14----------
and they didn't ask why but i told them


---------25:16----------
i wear green paint for 20 hours a week


---------25:19----------
and they were and i said uh


---------25:21----------
is am i and i asked them like am i gonna


---------25:23----------
die


---------25:24----------
and they said uh


---------25:26----------
you'll probably be fine


---------25:28----------
perfect


---------25:30----------
great i'll probably be fine dr k


---------25:33----------
i'm so glad that you sought real medical


---------25:35----------
advice for that that's honestly the only


---------25:37----------
concern that i have about the gecko suit


---------25:39----------
otherwise it's like you know people have


---------25:41----------
dye their hair people


---------25:43----------
wear makeup people


---------25:45----------
or you know where whatever


---------25:47----------
and it's like you do you bro


---------25:50----------
thank you doug i appreciate that


---------25:53----------
and


---------25:54----------
you know kind of going back you were


---------25:55----------
saying like your divorce isn't really


---------25:57----------
your problem i'm sold i'm not worried


---------25:58----------
about it it's just sometimes for some


---------26:00----------
people it is you know i think like you


---------26:02----------
said you kind of said they just weren't


---------26:04----------
compatible and they're like it's like


---------26:05----------
not that big of a deal totally fine man


---------26:08----------
and then i got kind of curious about you


---------26:09----------
said like oh it's like the root of my


---------26:11----------
problems but then i'm curious like what


---------26:12----------
what do you mean when you say problems


---------26:14----------
like what are your problems your


---------26:15----------
problems


---------26:16----------
do i have problems


---------26:18----------
i think


---------26:20----------
i think well i think everyone has


---------26:22----------
problems one of my problems


---------26:24----------
um


---------26:33----------
i don't know right now i'm have i'm


---------26:35----------
enjoy i'm having a good time


---------26:37----------
okay i don't think i'm trying the last


---------26:39----------
time


---------26:41----------
i i feel like i really had a problem


---------26:46----------
i don't know i i my life's pretty good


---------26:48----------
right now i'm like i i'm i'm pretty


---------26:50----------
grateful for where i'm at right now i


---------26:52----------
mean everyone like you know complains


---------26:54----------
about [ __ ]


---------26:55----------
but like if i were to actually like you


---------26:57----------
know take it like in the moment that i


---------26:59----------
just did where i had to think like what


---------27:01----------
like what are my


---------27:02----------
problems to talk to dr k about


---------27:05----------
i'm like i i'm


---------27:08----------
i'm pretty pretty grateful for


---------27:10----------
my life right now i think in a large


---------27:12----------
scale i


---------27:15----------
don't think i have any


---------27:16----------
any glaring problems


---------27:18----------
i i think you know i'm okay not fishing


---------27:22----------
or digging for them


---------27:23----------
if you're okay not


---------27:25----------
with if you're okay with me not doing


---------27:27----------
that


---------27:28----------
like did you come on here with the hopes


---------27:30----------
that i would uncover or unearth some


---------27:32----------
problem because if so we can go down


---------27:34----------
that route i could try harder but


---------27:36----------
there's a ton of stuff that i'm curious


---------27:37----------
about and i think that we can talk about


---------27:39----------
that could be like useful i would love


---------27:41----------
to talk about the stuff that you are


---------27:42----------
curious about yeah so dude tell me about


---------27:44----------
stand up bro like that's washed


---------27:47----------
uh


---------27:48----------
that was fun i um


---------27:51----------
i started when i was 16 years old like


---------27:54----------
because i really here because the thing


---------27:55----------
was the reason i started when i was 16


---------27:57----------
is because i i mean i wanted to do it


---------27:58----------
since i was 13 but i really did not want


---------28:01----------
my mom or dad to like watch me


---------28:05----------
so i waited until i got my driver's


---------28:07----------
license so i could go alone


---------28:09----------
um and so i did that and then i started


---------28:12----------
like uh it was it was it was fun i would


---------28:15----------
like uh


---------28:16----------
you know i was 16 and it was like there


---------28:19----------
would be like a school night and i my


---------28:21----------
mom was [ __ ] really cool and she


---------28:23----------
would let me like drive down


---------28:25----------
into the city to


---------28:26----------
hang out at like a punks club until 1am


---------28:30----------
waiting to go on at the


---------28:32----------
open mic and then i'd come back and wake


---------28:34----------
up at


---------28:35----------
6 and go into high school and i'm like


---------28:37----------
you [ __ ] do your intramural soccer


---------28:39----------
and your


---------28:41----------
frisbee but i'm doing the cool thing


---------28:43----------
here you know


---------28:45----------
um


---------28:46----------
but yeah that was it was fun um


---------28:49----------
i was gonna stop doing it


---------28:51----------
um


---------28:52----------
because uh


---------28:54----------
i don't know i just got i i i like i


---------28:56----------
like streaming more than stand up


---------28:58----------
because stand-up you'd kind of do alone


---------29:00----------
um


---------29:01----------
like when you like when you have to


---------29:03----------
write it like you sit in a [ __ ] dark


---------29:04----------
room and you have to like bang


---------29:06----------
everything out but what i like about


---------29:07----------
streaming is like if you have a if you


---------29:09----------
have something that you want to express


---------29:11----------
like a feeling or a thought or something


---------29:13----------
you just you literally just say it


---------29:15----------
and it and it and the purest form of


---------29:17----------
what you just said is what makes it


---------29:20----------
to


---------29:21----------
the person that is ingesting it as


---------29:22----------
opposed to like you know a a


---------29:25----------
tweet or something where you yeah right


---------29:28----------
right write your thought go ah that's


---------29:29----------
not the perfect way to say it delete it


---------29:30----------
right that's not the perfect way to say


---------29:32----------
it delete it you know


---------29:33----------
while you strike me as someone for whom


---------29:35----------
like authenticity is like very important


---------29:38----------
absolutely yeah you know like like what


---------29:40----------
i'm hearing is that there's a certain


---------29:41----------
amount of


---------29:44----------
sterilization that goes into tweeting


---------29:47----------
and and you know crafting jokes and


---------29:50----------
changing editing words and


---------29:52----------
things like that i mean i think one way


---------29:53----------
to look at it is craftsmanship i think


---------29:55----------
another way to look at it is


---------29:56----------
sterilization right like it's like it's


---------29:58----------
it's crafted


---------30:00----------
it's it's you know processed it's not


---------30:03----------
all natural


---------30:04----------
absolutely and on stream


---------30:07----------
and i'm also kind of noticing like even


---------30:08----------
when it comes to you know being a gecko


---------30:10----------
it seems like the gecko isn't


---------30:12----------
is really just


---------30:13----------
you know something that you kind of put


---------30:15----------
on but you're not really becoming a


---------30:16----------
different person


---------30:18----------
no not really um


---------30:21----------
i mean i like i like being the gecko i


---------30:23----------
think it's um


---------30:24----------
i will say i think it's easier


---------30:28----------
i don't i wouldn't even say this but


---------30:30----------
like i i like being slightly removed


---------30:34----------
from myself even though i'm not like you


---------30:36----------
know i go by a lot like when i'm gekko i


---------30:38----------
go by


---------30:39----------
lyle or geck or whatever but it is it is


---------30:41----------
it's it's fun to be in and to speak as


---------30:45----------
like an entity


---------30:46----------
as as opposed to like yourself


---------30:51----------
fun to speak as an entity


---------30:54----------
uh


---------30:55----------
i don't know


---------30:56----------
like being uh


---------31:00----------
i'm trying to think of how to go deeper


---------31:02----------
into that but like


---------31:04----------
it's


---------31:06----------
i like i like speaking


---------31:08----------
as a i mean i stream as myself too like


---------31:11----------
i mean i i guess i am always streaming


---------31:12----------
with myself but


---------31:14----------
uh i stream not wearing the gecko


---------31:15----------
costume um


---------31:18----------
i don't know it's like i i like


---------31:21----------
okay so the biggest the thing on like uh


---------31:25----------
the reason why i think that like my


---------31:26----------
stream has worked for me is like


---------31:29----------
if i if i got up on twitch and i was


---------31:31----------
like


---------31:33----------
my name is lyle drescher and this is the


---------31:35----------
lyle drescher show call in and ask me


---------31:38----------
lyle for advice or something people be


---------31:40----------
like who is i don't know who this guy is


---------31:42----------
what the who cares you know squirrel or


---------31:45----------
whatever but like presenting myself as


---------31:47----------
this like it's it's like a it's like a


---------31:50----------
being


---------31:51----------
that i feel like can be more easily


---------31:53----------
identified with than like just some


---------31:56----------
other random [ __ ] guy you know and i


---------31:58----------
and i like that you know i think that


---------32:00----------
that is more more interesting


---------32:05----------
i'm going to use a weird word here


---------32:08----------
please um but i almost almost getting


---------32:10----------
the sense that you're channeling the


---------32:12----------
therapy gecko


---------32:16----------
i totally channel the therapy gecko 100


---------32:18----------
percent


---------32:20----------
you know it doesn't sound like an act it


---------32:22----------
sounds like you become a conduit


---------32:25----------
yeah medium


---------32:26----------
yes yes i definitely


---------32:29----------
feel like i channel


---------32:31----------
a therapy and if i and i will say if i'm


---------32:33----------
trying hard to channel therapy gecko


---------32:36----------
i don't i don't want to say it's


---------32:37----------
different from myself because i believe


---------32:39----------
that like


---------32:41----------
ev every part of


---------32:42----------
like like i don't know


---------32:44----------
if if people are so complex like i feel


---------32:46----------
like every


---------32:48----------
i wouldn't say that me my channeling of


---------32:50----------
the gecko is like a different for me i


---------32:52----------
would say it is a part of me so i don't


---------32:54----------
want to say it's playing a character but


---------32:55----------
it is like


---------32:56----------
different than how i would be if i were


---------32:58----------
just like


---------32:59----------
you know having a conversation with


---------33:01----------
someone


---------33:02----------
you know off stream or something


---------33:04----------
lyle i have a concern that this


---------33:05----------
conversation may completely go off the


---------33:07----------
rails


---------33:10----------
let's do it so like here's the thing so


---------33:12----------
i i don't know i mean if there ain't no


---------33:14----------
problems to talk about totally fine


---------33:16----------
right so i think one of the biases that


---------33:17----------
people have is they assume that


---------33:19----------
people come on to the stream


---------33:21----------
explicitly to talk about problems and


---------33:23----------
that's what we're interested in but i


---------33:24----------
think what the story is really about is


---------33:26----------
understanding people


---------33:27----------
oh yeah and so in a weird way


---------33:30----------
what i kind of want to talk to you about


---------33:31----------
what i think is interesting to hear


---------33:33----------
about


---------33:34----------
um is creative process


---------33:37----------
success


---------33:38----------
and actually like flow


---------33:41----------
like are you familiar with


---------33:43----------
i love i love the i always say i always


---------33:45----------
say like uh you know i don't try to give


---------33:47----------
advice too often but like i do feel like


---------33:49----------
um


---------34:03----------
i genuinely feel like uh you know people


---------34:04----------
are always like trying to like how can i


---------34:06----------
be happy but i feel like flow is better


---------34:08----------
than happiness well help me understand


---------34:10----------
why flow is better than happiness


---------34:13----------
i i don't know because fl because


---------34:15----------
happiness just feels like


---------34:18----------
passive in a way like flow is like


---------34:20----------
all-encompassing and it's it's


---------34:23----------
it's very


---------34:25----------
i don't know i like it like i like i


---------34:26----------
feel like i'm in flow right now talking


---------34:28----------
to you i feel like i'm in that's why i


---------34:29----------
like streaming is because i feel like


---------34:31----------
when and it doesn't always happen you


---------34:32----------
know streaming can you know it's it's


---------34:34----------
not great a hundred percent of the time


---------34:35----------
but like when it is it's like i'm i'm in


---------34:37----------
flow state i'm fully engrossed in the


---------34:39----------
conversation that i'm having and that's


---------34:42----------
that's when i feel the best is is when


---------34:44----------
i'm in a flow state i'd like to be in a


---------34:46----------
flow state as much as i possibly can


---------34:49----------
i'm almost hearing you kind of say that


---------34:51----------
happiness is sort of like you kind of


---------34:53----------
said it's passive and being in a flow


---------34:55----------
state is like alive


---------34:58----------
it's like violent and experienced it's


---------35:01----------
not like


---------35:02----------
a calculation about like oh am i like


---------35:04----------
happy like yeah i'm happy like you can


---------35:06----------
you say that kind of in the abstract


---------35:08----------
right


---------35:09----------
like if someone else was like


---------35:11----------
it's like you know like


---------35:13----------
like like yeah like you could sit around


---------35:15----------
like like if you're sitting in a chair


---------35:17----------
in your big house and you have a bunch


---------35:19----------
of


---------35:20----------
money and you have a loving family and


---------35:22----------
you like are piecing look you're


---------35:24----------
thinking about your life and you're like


---------35:25----------
oh i'm happy you know i got good stuff


---------35:28----------
going on i'm really grateful for my life


---------35:30----------
like that's good but i like


---------35:32----------
but like when you're when you're in a


---------35:34----------
flow state it's it's you're not you're


---------35:35----------
not even [ __ ] thinking you're just


---------35:37----------
doing you're being you're in the you're


---------35:39----------
fully in the present and i think that's


---------35:41----------
when people are most happy is when


---------35:42----------
because when they're when they're in the


---------35:44----------
present not when they're like


---------35:45----------
thinking about their life from this


---------35:47----------
ethereal


---------35:48----------
[Music]


---------35:50----------
you know sort of step ladder position or


---------35:52----------
whatever


---------35:54----------
yeah so it sounds like you know


---------35:55----------
sometimes when you ask the question are


---------35:56----------
you happy what people do is they


---------35:58----------
make an abstract or intellectual


---------36:01----------
judgment


---------36:02----------
about whether the person in their


---------36:04----------
situation


---------36:06----------
should be happy


---------36:07----------
sure and then they will say


---------36:09----------
yes


---------36:10----------
i have the big house in the big chair


---------36:13----------
yes and and interesting that you use the


---------36:16----------
word chair there


---------36:17----------
you know the big chair


---------36:19----------
but i like i like i like the way that


---------36:21----------
you phrase that like i like the way you


---------36:22----------
phrase that like


---------36:24----------
thinking should a person who has what i


---------36:26----------
have be happy


---------36:28----------
as opposed to am i happy


---------36:31----------
i like i like the way you phrase that


---------36:33----------
yeah so i think unfortunately a lot of


---------36:36----------
people that i work in work with will you


---------36:38----------
know come into my office and say i have


---------36:41----------
all of the things that people


---------36:43----------
who should be happy have


---------36:45----------
and i'm not happy


---------36:48----------
which is a really interesting


---------36:49----------
exploration because


---------36:51----------
if those things don't necessarily lead


---------36:53----------
to happiness and you decouple having


---------36:56----------
those things from happiness what it also


---------36:58----------
implies is that if you have nothing you


---------37:01----------
can actually be happy


---------37:04----------
right exactly exactly


---------37:07----------
so let's try to understand


---------37:11----------
where


---------37:15----------
you're i'm trying to think about the


---------37:17----------
word


---------37:18----------
how did you get to be in a situation


---------37:20----------
where you are grateful and engage in the


---------37:23----------
flow state how did that happen for you


---------37:28----------
where i was grateful or when i was


---------37:30----------
engaged in the in the following how did


---------37:32----------
you get to where you are


---------37:37----------
um


---------37:39----------
how did i get to where i am well


---------37:43----------
so i've noticed that sometimes when i


---------37:45----------
ask you a question maybe it's like kind


---------37:46----------
of too broad


---------37:48----------
do you think it do you think it would be


---------37:50----------
good if i ask a broad question and kind


---------37:52----------
of give you some time to think through


---------37:54----------
it or would it be more helpful if i


---------37:56----------
just kind of teed you up a little bit


---------37:57----------
more


---------37:58----------
let's try let's try what you took me up


---------38:01----------
a little bit more looks like so here's


---------38:03----------
what i'm envisioning


---------38:05----------
there's lyle dresher


---------38:07----------
yes six-year-old kid growing up in a


---------38:09----------
jewish neighborhood presumably jewish


---------38:12----------
going to a hebrew school


---------38:14----------
incompatible parents parents get


---------38:16----------
divorced you're not really in the flow


---------38:18----------
state then parents remarry and stuff


---------38:20----------
there's no real trauma or anything like


---------38:22----------
that you know nothing juicy


---------38:24----------
for like a psychologist or therapist or


---------38:26----------
anything like that and then you're like


---------38:28----------
i'm i'm in fifth grade


---------38:30----------
i'm gonna make cool stuff on the


---------38:32----------
internet and so you started making cool


---------38:34----------
stuff on the internet you got like six


---------38:35----------
views


---------38:36----------
and then i don't know if if you were


---------38:38----------
happy then or not and then you're like


---------38:40----------
i'm gonna go to stand up at the age of


---------38:41----------
16 which if you want to talk about


---------38:43----------
having a pair of balls of being brave


---------38:44----------
like you know going to punk clubs at the


---------38:46----------
age of 16 and doing stand-up and unclear


---------38:49----------
whether people are laughing or not


---------38:51----------
laughing like


---------38:52----------
you know you kind of say you guys go do


---------38:54----------
your intramural stuff but i'm gonna go


---------38:56----------
do the cool thing whereas the other way


---------38:58----------
to look at it is like you guys


---------39:00----------
participate in society and i'm going to


---------39:02----------
be over here being an outcast


---------39:04----------
you know because i i i something tells


---------39:06----------
me that when you were 16 years old you


---------39:08----------
were not the cool kid even though you


---------39:11----------
described doing the cool


---------39:12----------
things i felt as though


---------39:16----------
i didn't feel like i was like actively


---------39:18----------
uncool but i did feel like uh


---------39:20----------
i had carved you know my friends and i


---------39:22----------
had carved our own


---------39:25----------
sort of like if you think of a a


---------39:27----------
traditional


---------39:29----------
you know


---------39:30----------
buy it cool kids and not cool like that


---------39:33----------
spectra i felt like as though we carved


---------39:35----------
our own


---------39:36----------
sort of lateral sort of thing later yes


---------39:39----------
we were lateral


---------39:40----------
yeah and so were you


---------39:43----------
happy then


---------39:45----------
and then i'm not quite sure how old you


---------39:47----------
are it sounds like you're maybe like 23


---------39:48----------
or something


---------39:50----------
yeah i'm exactly 23. so


---------39:52----------
um


---------39:53----------
you know and then about a year and a


---------39:55----------
half ago unclear whether you went to


---------39:57----------
college or you know what happened or


---------39:59----------
whether you were supporting yourself and


---------40:00----------
you kind of start doing this side thing


---------40:02----------
a couple years ago


---------40:04----------
on instagram on reddit public access


---------40:06----------
network


---------40:08----------
on tick tock and twitch and now when we


---------40:10----------
hear you talk about stuff it's sort of


---------40:12----------
like


---------40:14----------
i'm grateful for what i have and i enjoy


---------40:17----------
feeling alive


---------40:19----------
yes


---------40:20----------
and so how where did when did you start


---------40:21----------
to feel that way how did you get there


---------40:23----------
man


---------40:26----------
that's what teeing up looks like by the


---------40:27----------
way okay


---------40:30----------
ah okay yes you asked this yes there we


---------40:32----------
go okay you asked the same question but


---------40:33----------
you tweeted me out for it perfect


---------40:35----------
uh


---------40:36----------
i don't know if there is i don't i don't


---------40:38----------
know if there is a there


---------40:40----------
right like is is is isn't that a thing


---------40:43----------
like is there a there you know of course


---------40:45----------
there's not like uh


---------40:46----------
there


---------40:47----------
but like um


---------40:49----------
i've had uh


---------40:51----------
but it's like it's it's you know it's


---------40:53----------
it's interest i feel like it's the same


---------40:54----------
the feeling that i have i had it when i


---------40:56----------
was 16 when i was in the rock club about


---------40:59----------
to get on stage at one o'clock in the


---------41:01----------
morning when i had school tomorrow where


---------41:03----------
i think to myself i'm like this is cool


---------41:05----------
you know and then there's a feeling that


---------41:07----------
i have when i'm like


---------41:09----------
you know an internet gecko guy and you


---------41:12----------
know i'm twitch streaming for a living


---------41:14----------
where i'm like this is cool you know


---------41:17----------
um


---------41:19----------
but i don't know if it's uh if it's a


---------41:21----------
there or anything like that


---------41:23----------
um


---------41:26----------
you know


---------41:27----------
yeah so i i think lyle i think you're


---------41:29----------
doing it right because the more that you


---------41:31----------
talk the less sense you make and the


---------41:33----------
more you sound like a zen master


---------41:36----------
so you know is there there is a very


---------41:40----------
master kind of statement


---------41:42----------
right because if you look at zen


---------41:43----------
buddhism they'll say like weird things


---------41:45----------
like that there is no there there is


---------41:47----------
only here and it's like does that even


---------41:49----------
mean yeah yeah


---------41:51----------
but so help us understand what do you


---------41:52----------
mean by like is there really a there


---------41:54----------
there is no there


---------41:56----------
what does that mean man


---------41:58----------
doesn't make any [ __ ] sense


---------42:01----------
i don't know is there like like there is


---------42:03----------
never a time in which like


---------42:06----------
you know you are completely


---------42:09----------
you you you have unlocked i mean i don't


---------42:11----------
even know what the [ __ ] that would look


---------42:12----------
i think that i genuinely think that


---------42:13----------
looks like death like if you


---------42:15----------
like you've unlocked everything you are


---------42:17----------
supremely happy you're in post game new


---------42:20----------
game plus whatever


---------42:22----------
you know


---------42:23----------
uh uh


---------42:25----------
i don't know i don't know if what that


---------42:27----------
even looks like i think that there's


---------42:28----------
just like people i think


---------42:30----------
the way to combat that is just to really


---------42:32----------
love the process and the the the the


---------42:35----------
journey toward


---------42:36----------
the thing you know


---------42:40----------
yeah but what if the journey sucks


---------42:44----------
like what happened so do you have any


---------42:46----------
memories of of going to the rock club


---------42:48----------
when you were 16


---------42:51----------
like specific memories yeah like can you


---------42:53----------
tell us like paint us a picture of like


---------42:56----------
you know


---------42:57----------
like what you remember like if you have


---------42:59----------
kind of memory yeah i mean yeah i would


---------43:01----------
like show up and park my car in


---------43:03----------
somewhere where i was just hoping i


---------43:05----------
wasn't gonna get a ticket and then i


---------43:07----------
would come into the


---------43:09----------
thing and i was younger than everyone


---------43:10----------
else so i like i mean everyone else was


---------43:12----------
like you know


---------43:13----------
late 20s like like mid to late 20s or or


---------43:16----------
sometimes early 20s


---------43:18----------
which i guess looked like mid to late


---------43:20----------
what i look at now if that makes sense


---------43:23----------
yeah um


---------43:25----------
and so like i was afraid i didn't i just


---------43:26----------
kind of didn't talk to anyone


---------43:28----------
you know and i was real and a few like


---------43:31----------
people would come up and talk to me i


---------43:33----------
was really grateful


---------43:34----------
for those people because i was too you i


---------43:36----------
wasn't gonna like


---------43:37----------
make the first like hey what's up man


---------43:40----------
kind of thing


---------43:41----------
you know um


---------43:42----------
so i really remembered everyone who came


---------43:44----------
up and like would talk to me uh


---------43:47----------
but i i was being i was like nervous i


---------43:49----------
just wouldn't like talk to anyone i just


---------43:50----------
really wanted to like wait


---------43:52----------
sit watch comedians they don't like to


---------43:54----------
watch each other like stand in the back


---------43:57----------
but i but i didn't know anyway i didn't


---------43:58----------
have anyone to stand in the back with so


---------44:01----------
i would just sit and watch


---------44:03----------
and um


---------44:05----------
uh


---------44:06----------
and just kind of wait my turn i remember


---------44:08----------
actually no this was the very second


---------44:10----------
time it was when i went to the rock club


---------44:11----------
the very second time i did stand up i


---------44:13----------
remember being


---------44:15----------
no i remember being in the i went to the


---------44:17----------
bathroom it was like a punk bathroom and


---------44:19----------
all these stickers and i was like really


---------44:20----------
nervous i was nervous to be there like


---------44:21----------
to walk into the room like while i was


---------44:23----------
16 like from all these people who were


---------44:27----------
you know older than me and i remember i


---------44:29----------
had just read this book


---------44:31----------
by this guy named chris gethard and in


---------44:34----------
the book he talks about uh


---------44:37----------
how he like well he he likes going out


---------44:40----------
of his way


---------44:41----------
to um


---------44:43----------
put himself in situations


---------44:45----------
that are uncomfortable just for the


---------44:48----------
just i i don't know i remember reading


---------44:50----------
that when i was 16 and that spoke to me


---------44:52----------
so i was in the bathroom thinking about


---------44:54----------
that and being like all right i'm going


---------44:55----------
to embrace that and i've actually that


---------44:57----------
sort of started a


---------44:59----------
a a thing of like embracing


---------45:02----------
being in uncomfortable


---------45:04----------
situations


---------45:06----------
um


---------45:07----------
so i remember i was in the bathroom and


---------45:09----------
i was like okay i'm not gonna leave i'm


---------45:10----------
gonna stay and i'm gonna do my set it's


---------45:12----------
gonna be uncomfortable but i think it's


---------45:14----------
cool that i'm really uncomfortable


---------45:17----------
right now you know i could like i said i


---------45:19----------
could i could have played soccer


---------45:22----------
and what was it like when you did your


---------45:23----------
set


---------45:27----------
it was the second so that was the second


---------45:29----------
time i did stand up the first time i did


---------45:31----------
really well and then this is what


---------45:32----------
happens is you do really well and then


---------45:35----------
you second time you do the same like


---------45:37----------
jokes or whatever and they don't do as


---------45:39----------
well


---------45:39----------
and uh


---------45:41----------
but it didn't jar me that much


---------45:43----------
one of the cool things about like going


---------45:45----------
to open mics and stuff is like everyone


---------45:46----------
thinks that stand up is so like


---------45:48----------
life like life or death like i can't


---------45:50----------
feel like oh my god i can't fathom the


---------45:51----------
idea of like being up in front of people


---------45:53----------
and like trying to be funny and not


---------45:54----------
working but then you go and you do it


---------45:55----------
and you're like oh it's not it's it's


---------45:57----------
part of the thing it's not that bad and


---------45:59----------
you see other people fail and and you


---------46:01----------
know


---------46:02----------
it wasn't that bad it was kind of it was


---------46:04----------
fun um you know i had a couple things go


---------46:05----------
over well and i talked to a few people


---------46:07----------
and uh


---------46:08----------
i came home i felt cool and uh


---------46:12----------
and yeah even though the second set


---------46:14----------
didn't


---------46:15----------
go well helped me yeah i know i still i


---------46:17----------
still felt cool i felt cool for having


---------46:19----------
done it you know i i wouldn't say it


---------46:21----------
didn't go well i said i i think um


---------46:24----------
it went okay


---------46:26----------
you know um


---------46:30----------
i i wouldn't say like like i like i


---------46:32----------
would rate it you know a six out of ten


---------46:34----------
maybe


---------46:35----------
um


---------46:37----------
but i liked uh i liked i liked the scene


---------46:40----------
i liked


---------46:41----------
going there and i liked being


---------46:43----------
somewhere weird at a weird time


---------46:46----------
as a 16 year old you know i liked that


---------46:49----------
so i really care


---------46:50----------
how the set went if i got to


---------46:54----------
you know do that


---------46:58----------
so it felt


---------46:59----------
cool


---------47:01----------
to once again i'm kind of getting the


---------47:02----------
sense of like carving out


---------47:05----------
right like you're gonna follow


---------47:08----------
right


---------47:09----------
yeah


---------47:10----------
yeah you just did a help me understand


---------47:12----------
that what what happened what is that


---------47:14----------
what does car what does carving out mean


---------47:16----------
i you're the one who used the words


---------47:19----------
i am


---------47:20----------
yeah so you were


---------47:21----------
carving out and forget that i said that


---------47:24----------
don't worry about it oh oh like oh oh oh


---------47:26----------
yes carving the pa oh yes yeah okay yeah


---------47:28----------
so but but something about when i used


---------47:30----------
the words just now to describe your


---------47:32----------
comedy experience it seemed like it hit


---------47:34----------
a nerve


---------47:35----------
right like oh because i because i didn't


---------47:36----------
realize what you were uh oh okay okay


---------47:39----------
but now i do oh yes


---------47:40----------
yes yes and that's um


---------47:43----------
you know that's i think that's kind of


---------47:45----------
been a big part of uh


---------47:47----------
my


---------47:48----------
like a


---------47:49----------
in a way approach to life you know


---------47:53----------
as i've always wanted to


---------47:56----------
you know try to carve out my own


---------47:59----------
thing you know


---------48:00----------
and uh that's that's been a big goal of


---------48:03----------
mine


---------48:04----------
for a while and and that's why i'm


---------48:06----------
really grateful i get to do this weird


---------48:09----------
gecko talk show thing because it it


---------48:11----------
feels like i'm able to carve out my own


---------48:14----------
uh


---------48:15----------
you know sort of path in life oh


---------48:17----------
absolutely i think i think you literally


---------48:20----------
wear carving out your life on your


---------48:21----------
sleeve


---------48:23----------
right that's awesome


---------48:25----------
like i mean literally like you you


---------48:28----------
put on a [ __ ] costume


---------48:31----------
yes to show people that you're not going


---------48:33----------
to play intramural whatever


---------48:36----------
right


---------48:37----------
you're not going to look you're not


---------48:38----------
going to look human


---------48:40----------
yes yes you're goddamn right dr k


---------48:43----------
and uh


---------48:45----------
because i'm noticing like that's


---------48:47----------
absolutely a theme right like it's sort


---------48:48----------
of like what i'm what i'm hearing is


---------48:50----------
that within you


---------48:52----------
there's a voice that has said don't do


---------48:55----------
as others do do this other thing like


---------48:57----------
and not so much that there's anything


---------48:58----------
wrong with what other people do but


---------49:00----------
really like listen to what that internal


---------49:02----------
voice is because i don't know many


---------49:03----------
people who at the age of 16 were going


---------49:05----------
to comedy clubs and doing stand up


---------49:07----------
i know a lot of 16 year olds who had


---------49:09----------
dreams of doing stand up


---------49:11----------
i know a lot of 16 year olds who wanted


---------49:13----------
to be stand-up comedians and have like a


---------49:15----------
netflix special or hbo special or things


---------49:18----------
like that i know a lot of 16 year olds


---------49:20----------
who thought they were very funny


---------49:22----------
and could do stand-up


---------49:25----------
i certainly knew a lot of 16 year olds


---------49:26----------
who thought they were as funny as the


---------49:28----------
people who are actually doing stand up


---------49:31----------
but i didn't know many people who


---------49:33----------
actually did stand up


---------49:36----------
well now if you're a 16 year old and you


---------49:38----------
think you're funny you don't even you


---------49:39----------
don't even have to go to the rock club


---------49:41----------
downtown you just whip out your phone


---------49:43----------
and make a tick-tock


---------49:46----------
and granted i was sort of doing that


---------49:47----------
same sort of thing but uh you know


---------49:50----------
so there's another thing that i kind of


---------49:52----------
want to just touch on for a second which


---------49:53----------
is just really really sharing an opinion


---------49:56----------
um i don't know that i have a whole lot


---------49:57----------
of questions for you but you know feel


---------49:59----------
free to


---------50:00----------
respond but like


---------50:02----------
so i think a lot of times when people


---------50:03----------
look at success


---------50:05----------
what they really look at is


---------50:09----------
like people will say like oh the guy put


---------50:10----------
on a gecko costume and like blew up on


---------50:13----------
tick tock and that's why he's successful


---------50:15----------
right there they'll say sort of say


---------50:17----------
things like put right place right time


---------50:19----------
kind of like the stars aligned and and


---------50:22----------
like


---------50:23----------
you know


---------50:24----------
that's how you became successful but i


---------50:26----------
think for most people that i've worked


---------50:28----------
with who are very successful what i


---------50:30----------
almost always find is a story actually a


---------50:32----------
lot like yours


---------50:34----------
whereas like you know the therapy gecko


---------50:36----------
is not


---------50:37----------
the first step in a journey like you


---------50:40----------
started making content on the internet


---------50:42----------
at the age of what sounds like 10 or 11.


---------50:45----------
yeah and so you've been thinking about


---------50:47----------
it working on it you literally went to


---------50:48----------
stand-up comedy clubs at the age of 16


---------50:51----------
and you've been practicing creating


---------50:54----------
content and being funny in the somewhat


---------50:56----------
intentional way ever since your brain


---------50:59----------
was like very very young and like


---------51:01----------
literally wiring


---------51:03----------
and then it's not surprising at all but


---------51:05----------
what i tend to find i'll see this also


---------51:07----------
in like you know some of the startup


---------51:08----------
founders that i work with that like


---------51:10----------
very few of them are successful with


---------51:12----------
their first company like what happens is


---------51:14----------
they're like in when they were eight


---------51:16----------
they started a lemonade stand


---------51:18----------
and then when they were 14 they like


---------51:20----------
started this hustle at school where they


---------51:22----------
were like selling candy bars


---------51:25----------
like one guy that i worked with like


---------51:27----------
they you know the school stopped


---------51:29----------
using having a coke machine or something


---------51:31----------
so they were like selling cokes like


---------51:33----------
behind the cafeteria and [ __ ] like that


---------51:36----------
and then like you know they went on to


---------51:37----------
be like


---------51:38----------
yeah black market cokes


---------51:40----------
um


---------51:41----------
and and so i think i just wanted to kind


---------51:42----------
of comment because i think a lot of


---------51:43----------
people in our community are sort of


---------51:45----------
trying to figure out like how do i be


---------51:47----------
successful


---------51:48----------
or they'll sort of try to you know ask


---------51:50----------
themselves hey i'm like trying to work


---------51:52----------
on this stuff but it doesn't seem to be


---------51:53----------
working and i don't know what to do next


---------51:56----------
and i think it's just important to


---------51:57----------
highlight that like


---------51:59----------
you know you've been working at this for


---------52:00----------
probably over a decade in some way shape


---------52:03----------
or form


---------52:04----------
and so the therapy gecko that people see


---------52:06----------
is not just a random guy putting on like


---------52:08----------
a gecko costume


---------52:10----------
it's like actually like you know when


---------52:12----------
you speak and you wind up being


---------52:14----------
relatively funny that there's like


---------52:17----------
you know a lot of like internal


---------52:18----------
psychological work that you've done


---------52:20----------
sitting in a bathroom and sort of like


---------52:22----------
you know


---------52:23----------
dealing with your nervousness and then


---------52:24----------
getting up there and trying to be funny


---------52:27----------
being okay with a six out of ten and


---------52:29----------
then showing up the next week and doing


---------52:30----------
it again and like practicing and working


---------52:32----------
on your your craft


---------52:33----------
um


---------52:34----------
it was just something that i i noticed


---------52:36----------
hearing your story and just wanted to


---------52:38----------
kind of point it out


---------52:39----------
what do you think oh yeah i know i i


---------52:42----------
appreciate that um it's funny i i've uh


---------52:45----------
i've like sort of thought about that um


---------52:49----------
you know


---------52:50----------
i


---------52:51----------
uh


---------52:53----------
the the therapy gecko is very new but i


---------52:56----------
i i like


---------52:58----------
this is sort of a random thing i was


---------52:59----------
like thinking about in my head i was


---------53:00----------
like you know


---------53:01----------
trying to give myself credit because i


---------53:02----------
was like you know the therapy echo is


---------53:03----------
very new but like the i


---------53:05----------
a lot of the


---------53:07----------
sort of roots of it are are it are not


---------53:10----------
you know like i've been trying to you


---------53:12----------
know as i said sort of carve out my own


---------53:14----------
path you know for a very long time and


---------53:17----------
uh


---------53:18----------
you know


---------53:19----------
trying to do


---------53:20----------
silly things on the computer for a very


---------53:22----------
long time so


---------53:24----------
like even though like


---------53:26----------
streaming and being a lizard


---------53:28----------
are kind of new i think the stuff behind


---------53:31----------
it


---------53:32----------
is is kind of not


---------53:34----------
yeah


---------53:36----------
so


---------53:38----------
interesting so okay um and


---------53:43----------
what do you think it is that helps you


---------53:45----------
get into that flow state


---------53:50----------
you need me to see you on that


---------53:54----------
sure i'm


---------53:55----------
i'd love to hear the tea up


---------53:57----------
i don't have one


---------53:58----------
okay all right well if i don't know that


---------54:00----------
that i think i could uh that question i


---------54:01----------
think you could answer um


---------54:06----------
um because i love this thing the tea up


---------54:08----------
uh well okay so i mean a lot of the


---------54:10----------
stuff that i was doing before like i was


---------54:12----------
doing this was like


---------54:14----------
trying to like


---------54:15----------
write


---------54:16----------
jokes or write uh


---------54:20----------
sketch and like that that's like right


---------54:23----------
like sitting down and writing


---------54:25----------
getting into the flow state is so hard


---------54:28----------
like i respect the [ __ ] out of people


---------54:30----------
who can like sit and write essays or


---------54:33----------
write


---------54:35----------
the sonnet whatever the hell you're


---------54:36----------
writing like uh


---------54:38----------
you know i respect the [ __ ] out of


---------54:40----------
people who can do that because it's this


---------54:42----------
there's infinite like this is like i'm


---------54:45----------
in the flow state with you right now i


---------54:46----------
really feel like you know we're having a


---------54:48----------
conversation i can't


---------54:50----------
stop our conversation to like go look at


---------54:52----------
youtube


---------54:53----------
or like go eat a snack


---------54:55----------
or you know go do this or like like


---------54:58----------
there's no


---------55:00----------
i like i'm i'm in this i'm talking to


---------55:02----------
you we're doing this right now we're


---------55:04----------
live


---------55:05----------
there's no room for


---------55:08----------
me to get distracted or anything whereas


---------55:10----------
like if you're trying to like write


---------55:11----------
something or edit a video or


---------55:15----------
make a song or something like that you


---------55:16----------
know there's no


---------55:19----------
thing that's like i don't know if i'm


---------55:20----------
gonna use the phrase holding accountable


---------55:22----------
because i don't really feel like i'm


---------55:23----------
being like held accountable but like


---------55:26----------
you know


---------55:28----------
it's it's much so so when i stream and


---------55:31----------
like you know i talk to people you know


---------55:33----------
it's easy for me to get into the flow


---------55:34----------
state because like a conversation is


---------55:36----------
developing naturally


---------55:38----------
and it's just it just is a


---------55:41----------
much more natural thing to do than like


---------55:44----------
you know sit down and put pen to


---------55:46----------
paper so you know i'd i'd been


---------55:48----------
sorry so that's why i like it i like it


---------55:50----------
a lot as a


---------55:51----------
as a as a medium of of doing things on


---------55:55----------
the internets


---------55:57----------
and creating in a sense


---------56:00----------
i'm with you so lyle now i'm gonna ask


---------56:03----------
you a question which yeah i'm gonna try


---------56:05----------
to answer after i ask you but i'm gonna


---------56:08----------
ask you okay what what would you say are


---------56:10----------
the features of the flow state what


---------56:13----------
makes the flow state different from the


---------56:15----------
non-flow state


---------56:17----------
um you're doing more than you're


---------56:19----------
thinking about what you're doing and


---------56:22----------
you're not


---------56:23----------
so critical critical of yourself and


---------56:25----------
analyzing yourself


---------56:27----------
you know like if i'm really in the flow


---------56:29----------
state i'm not


---------56:31----------
like like if we're like when we're like


---------56:32----------
like you know at the highest points of


---------56:34----------
like flow i would say like in our


---------56:35----------
conversation i'm not thinking about like


---------56:38----------
oh how's chat reacting to this or like


---------56:40----------
how is this coming off or anything i'm


---------56:42----------
just talking you know and that's how i


---------56:44----------
feel like when i do my own stream is


---------56:45----------
like you know i'm not i'm really not


---------56:47----------
thinking about anything else except for


---------56:51----------
you know the person i'm talking to but i


---------56:53----------
guess to answer the question more like


---------56:54----------
the the traits of the flow state so i


---------56:56----------
guess i'll maybe a lack of


---------57:00----------
a loss of ego i don't know i'm not gonna


---------57:03----------
start pretending like i know anything


---------57:04----------
about


---------57:05----------
spiritual stuff but uh oh you know a lot


---------57:07----------
about spiritual stuff while


---------57:10----------
uh


---------57:12----------
what does that mean


---------57:15----------
see this is why i didn't want to say


---------57:16----------
because then you were going to ask me


---------57:17----------
what it means and i was i i don't know


---------57:19----------
if i can explain it as well i guess like


---------57:21----------
uh well i guess like what it means to me


---------57:23----------
is like you know


---------57:25----------
like i said like if if i'm not thinking


---------57:27----------
about how i'm coming off i have the free


---------57:29----------
like like that's a crutch like thinking


---------57:32----------
about what other people think about you


---------57:33----------
is like a [ __ ]


---------57:34----------
crutch and it'll prevent you from


---------57:37----------
speaking


---------57:39----------
freely because you're like oh no that


---------57:41----------
sounded stupid that says you're just


---------57:42----------
you're speaking freely


---------57:44----------
um


---------57:46----------
and


---------57:47----------
so i think that that


---------57:49----------
freedom from


---------57:51----------
self criticism as you're speaking or or


---------57:54----------
as you're writing or painting or doing


---------57:56----------
you know whatever you'd be doing is is


---------57:58----------
an integral part of the the flow state


---------58:01----------
sounded like a pretty good answer to me


---------58:03----------
about what loss of ego is


---------58:05----------
right so what i'm hearing is that there


---------58:08----------
are times where you think about yourself


---------58:13----------
as it relates to an activity


---------58:15----------
if i'm writing am i a good writer is


---------58:18----------
this good writing and then there are


---------58:20----------
times where you are removed from the


---------58:22----------
equation and there is just


---------58:26----------
yeah so it's kind of interesting because


---------58:28----------
even if we go back to the beginning of


---------58:29----------
the interview


---------58:30----------
there were times where your ego was


---------58:32----------
present


---------58:33----------
like oh is dr k gonna be pissed if i


---------58:36----------
show up


---------58:37----------
see then you're thinking about how other


---------58:40----------
people will respond to you and now you


---------58:41----------
don't care what i think


---------58:43----------
you're not even thinking about what i


---------58:44----------
think


---------58:45----------
they're just having the conversation and


---------58:48----------
so what we've actually done is somehow


---------58:50----------
we've managed to remove ego from the


---------58:52----------
equation


---------58:53----------
right and as we remove as you're no


---------58:55----------
longer concerned about oh am i supposed


---------58:57----------
to be talking about problem am i


---------58:58----------
supposed to be doing this so i think


---------59:00----------
supposed to is another good word that


---------59:03----------
sort of shatters the flow state


---------59:07----------
um


---------59:08----------
but i i think you you know this stuff


---------59:10----------
and and that's why i don't feel like i


---------59:12----------
have to tee you up for it and i think


---------59:14----------
the only thing is you don't know that


---------59:15----------
you know it or you have you have you


---------59:17----------
don't have faith that you can explain it


---------59:19----------
but it's pretty clear to me and what i'm


---------59:21----------
going to do at the end


---------59:22----------
and maybe the end is you know whenever


---------59:24----------
we can do it now if you want to it


---------59:26----------
doesn't have to be the end but what i'm


---------59:27----------
going to do is actually go through a


---------59:29----------
list of statements that you've made


---------59:31----------
and kind of tie them together to like


---------59:34----------
old spiritual texts on meditation


---------59:36----------
spiritual growth and enlightenment


---------59:38----------
because you do say a lot of remarkable


---------59:41----------
stuff that like overlaps with what those


---------59:43----------
folks say


---------59:47----------
that's uh


---------59:48----------
you know what's funny is like i when


---------59:49----------
you're i'm always like


---------59:51----------
had this uh thing of like you know


---------59:53----------
waiting like


---------59:54----------
oh god you know no no no say the thing


---------59:56----------
first and then i'll and i'll say go for


---------59:58----------
it now i'm curious i guess like uh like


---------60:00----------
if i had like if i had a thought like


---------60:03----------
like if you have a thought you're almost


---------60:04----------
like waiting for it to get like like


---------60:06----------
you're sort of waiting for it to get


---------60:07----------
validated for other people to like be


---------60:09----------
something that makes sense


---------60:11----------
and like i think everyone has that i've


---------60:13----------
been active


---------60:14----------
and like and like i definitely have that


---------60:16----------
i've tried to fight against that so you


---------60:19----------
saying that like i've said something


---------60:21----------
that oh another guy said that wrote a


---------60:23----------
book that was saying that thing i'm like


---------60:25----------
oh okay so i was onto something there


---------60:27----------
when i thought that thing that wasn't


---------60:29----------
just a crazy thing that i thought


---------60:31----------
no yeah no i think you're on to a lot so


---------60:34----------
this is what i think is really i guess


---------60:35----------
we can do it now um because


---------60:37----------
so the first thing that i want to kind


---------60:39----------
of share is that like when you look at


---------60:41----------
old texts on spirituality


---------60:43----------
um sometimes people will sort of talk


---------60:45----------
about philosophy or like argument or


---------60:47----------
logic and say like this is not like like


---------60:50----------
you know you can't


---------60:51----------
what is ego death and they'll like try


---------60:52----------
to understand it on an intellectual or


---------60:54----------
logical level so like what does it mean


---------60:57----------
to lose your ego you know the loss of


---------60:59----------
ego but the really interesting thing


---------61:01----------
about these at least the spiritual


---------61:03----------
traditions that that i tend to place a


---------61:05----------
lot of emphasis in that i've studied


---------61:06----------
that i propagate in some sense


---------61:09----------
um are sort of like the hindu and


---------61:11----------
buddhist traditions and and what i


---------61:12----------
actually really like about them is that


---------61:14----------
i think they're


---------61:15----------
they have a very scientific attitude so


---------61:18----------
they don't say that this is logically


---------61:19----------
correct and they don't say that you


---------61:21----------
should believe this they say that if you


---------61:24----------
go and explore


---------61:26----------
and try to figure out how this stuff


---------61:28----------
works when we tried to figure out how


---------61:30----------
this stuff works here are the


---------61:32----------
conclusions we came to and we suspect


---------61:35----------
because then we had a bunch of other


---------61:37----------
people go and investigate it on their


---------61:39----------
own and this is consistently what people


---------61:41----------
come up with and so what i really love


---------61:43----------
about this is like literally today lyle


---------61:45----------
you've made statement after statement


---------61:47----------
after statement that i have read in


---------61:49----------
texts that are 600 years old a thousand


---------61:52----------
years old 2 000 years old or 4 000 years


---------61:55----------
old and i pointed out one which is like


---------61:57----------
i asked you how do you get there and


---------61:59----------
your [ __ ] answer is like it's like


---------62:01----------
classic zen there is no there


---------62:04----------
right and no one knows what the hell


---------62:06----------
that means but like you understand it


---------62:09----------
it like doesn't translate into like


---------62:12----------
logical words we can try to do a


---------62:14----------
slightly better job there because there


---------62:15----------
is a there's you know


---------62:16----------
practice that can be done in explaining


---------62:18----------
some of these weird concepts


---------62:20----------
but they're sort of like anyway so let's


---------62:22----------
kind of start from the top so the first


---------62:24----------
thing that i actually want to point out


---------62:26----------
is so i think how you got to where you


---------62:28----------
are okay


---------62:30----------
so


---------62:32----------
we've already talked a little bit about


---------62:33----------
success


---------62:35----------
and how like i actually think that i'm


---------62:36----------
not surprised that you blew up because i


---------62:38----------
think you've actually dedicated yourself


---------62:40----------
to like a craft for some time


---------62:44----------
and if you think about you know your


---------62:45----------
cognitive development and the way that


---------62:47----------
your neurons have wired like you are


---------62:49----------
somewhat of a professional when it comes


---------62:51----------
to whatever whatever it is that we see


---------62:55----------
like this is not just a random


---------62:56----------
happenstance right you've been creating


---------62:58----------
content since you were 10 you did stand


---------63:00----------
up comedy like i was stunned to hear


---------63:02----------
both of those things but now it's sort


---------63:03----------
of making sense for me


---------63:05----------
and then you you also have like you know


---------63:07----------
you've experimented with different kind


---------63:09----------
of platforms and stuff like that and


---------63:10----------
found a nice combination of what sounds


---------63:12----------
like live streaming on twitch which


---------63:14----------
brings out the flow state so you're also


---------63:16----------
doing a couple of really cool things


---------63:18----------
that i'll try to help creative people do


---------63:20----------
what are the circumstances that


---------63:22----------
naturally blink bring out the flow state


---------63:24----------
because when you bring out the flow


---------63:25----------
state you're going to create the best


---------63:26----------
content


---------63:27----------
and then you're sort of pairing up


---------63:29----------
twitch to get that live interaction to


---------63:32----------
set yourself up to bring out the flow


---------63:33----------
state and then you kind of clip that


---------63:35----------
[ __ ] for tick tock because you can't sit


---------63:37----------
down and make a tick tock yes some


---------63:40----------
people can sit down and script the tick


---------63:42----------
tock but you cannot


---------63:43----------
you've got a farm tick tock moments on


---------63:45----------
twitch


---------63:47----------
yes i this is i this is like i've been


---------63:50----------
waiting my almost like i've been waiting


---------63:52----------
forever to figure this out and it's


---------63:53----------
something i try to like


---------63:55----------
tell people who are having like trouble


---------63:56----------
creating things is like i


---------63:58----------
like exactly what i can't sit down and


---------64:00----------
like write a tick tock but like what


---------64:04----------
the the way in which i edit


---------64:06----------
like


---------64:07----------
the twitch and streaming allows me to


---------64:09----------
just get the [ __ ] raw thoughts


---------64:12----------
through of whatever it is i'm thinking


---------64:15----------
or or feeling and then when i go in to


---------64:17----------
edit it i actually i have like it's it's


---------64:20----------
there and i just chop it away and like


---------64:23----------
find it you know and that's like


---------64:26----------
such


---------64:28----------
a better creative process


---------64:30----------
than


---------64:31----------
sitting and writing you know so can i


---------64:34----------
discover that until recently yeah so can


---------64:36----------
i share a couple of thoughts on that so


---------64:38----------
i've worked with a lot of people who


---------64:40----------
sort of experience things that way so i


---------64:41----------
think part of the problem with when we


---------64:43----------
think about how to become successful


---------64:45----------
is that we're given a script right so


---------64:48----------
there are some people who have become


---------64:49----------
very very successful


---------64:51----------
and then we'll look at them and we'll


---------64:52----------
say like you know you can look at


---------64:54----------
successful authors like you know let's


---------64:55----------
say like someone like brandon sanderson


---------64:57----------
who will say like you know sit down and


---------64:59----------
like write every day what you've got to


---------65:01----------
do is like write every day and then if


---------65:03----------
you read other people like stephen king


---------65:05----------
apparently like early on you know he


---------65:06----------
would use a lot of drugs and and just


---------65:08----------
write very


---------65:10----------
like a ton of stuff so different people


---------65:12----------
have different creative processes so a


---------65:14----------
couple of things that i want to kind of


---------65:15----------
highlight about yours because i think a


---------65:17----------
lot of people can become successful


---------65:19----------
without forcing themselves into


---------65:22----------
a cognitive temperament that does not


---------65:24----------
suit them so a lot of the work that i i


---------65:27----------
do is about helping people understand


---------65:28----------
okay what what's your cognitive


---------65:30----------
temperament and how can we set your


---------65:33----------
brain up for success so some people are


---------65:36----------
the methodical route like i'm gonna sit


---------65:38----------
down and i'm gonna write every day for


---------65:39----------
six hours and you gotta just sit down


---------65:41----------
and just like do it and then some people


---------65:43----------
i think this is really important so


---------65:45----------
a big part of the flow state like we


---------65:47----------
said is separating the ego from the


---------65:49----------
action


---------65:51----------
and with some authors that i've worked


---------65:52----------
with what they struggle with is there's


---------65:54----------
the author and then there's the editor


---------65:57----------
there's like you know the person there's


---------65:59----------
the creative and then there's the judge


---------66:02----------
and if both of those are coexisting in


---------66:04----------
your mind if you sit down and you try to


---------66:06----------
write


---------66:07----------
and the editor is there criticizing the


---------66:09----------
sentence that comes out you will be


---------66:11----------
paralyzed in front of the page you will


---------66:13----------
never get a single sentence out you have


---------66:15----------
to let yourself write crap you have to


---------66:18----------
separate out almost like left brain


---------66:19----------
right brain it's not really


---------66:20----------
neuroscientifically based but it's a


---------66:22----------
concept that people understand you know


---------66:23----------
you have to set out to separate out the


---------66:25----------
creative part of you from the judging or


---------66:28----------
editing part of you and what i hear you


---------66:30----------
kind of say is like in the editing


---------66:32----------
process what you do is you vomit out


---------66:34----------
golden trash on twitch


---------66:36----------
and then you can let the editor step in


---------66:40----------
and sort of sift things apart but if you


---------66:43----------
try to filter or create gold to begin


---------66:46----------
with you will never succeed


---------66:48----------
yeah of course of course yeah that's


---------66:50----------
that's why


---------66:51----------
dude that's that's almost like probably


---------66:53----------
a big


---------66:54----------
kind of i was doing that for a while


---------66:56----------
like when i was like you know doing


---------66:57----------
stand-up and making videos and stuff


---------66:59----------
like i was able to like get stuff out


---------67:01----------
but um [ __ ] i hate i hated that process


---------67:04----------
of like sitting down to i never got into


---------67:06----------
the flow state


---------67:08----------
of it you know and it's it's it's it's


---------67:10----------
tough that's probably a big reason why i


---------67:11----------
like


---------67:12----------
you know i like to do twitch stuff


---------67:14----------
instead of that


---------67:16----------
yeah so let's talk a little bit about


---------67:17----------
the flow state so i think there are a


---------67:19----------
couple of very important


---------67:21----------
psychological things that you have done


---------67:24----------
which have really set you up for success


---------67:26----------
and these are things that i want to


---------67:27----------
highlight


---------67:29----------
so you remember how your memory sucks


---------67:32----------
you don't remember anything


---------67:34----------
yes


---------67:35----------
do you i'm gonna ask you kind of a weird


---------67:37----------
question


---------67:38----------
so there's been really only one time


---------67:40----------
during our conversation where you have


---------67:42----------
given us an incredibly vivid and lively


---------67:46----------
picture of a past memory from your life


---------67:48----------
do you remember what


---------67:50----------
you you remember what it was yeah it was


---------67:52----------
the i was being at the rock club


---------67:54----------
absolutely right so this is like how


---------67:56----------
memory works because i think that was a


---------67:58----------
transformative moment for you


---------68:00----------
because what you did in the bathroom was


---------68:02----------
embrace discomfort


---------68:04----------
right that's that's those are the words


---------68:06----------
that you used so this is like when the


---------68:07----------
yogis are saying acceptance


---------68:10----------
like that is literally what acceptance


---------68:12----------
looks like it's a 16 year old


---------68:14----------
remembering a book they read sitting


---------68:16----------
there with butterflies in their stomach


---------68:18----------
feeling out of place in a [ __ ]


---------68:19----------
bathroom about to vomit and saying you


---------68:21----------
know what let's go yeah let's go [ __ ]


---------68:26----------
because you can retreat in that moment


---------68:28----------
or you can embrace that discomfort and


---------68:30----------
so the yogis say that like you shouldn't


---------68:33----------
try to push away negative emotions you


---------68:35----------
need to accept your negative emotions


---------68:38----------
right right that's what literally what


---------68:39----------
acceptance looks like and once you begin


---------68:42----------
to accept that and embrace that there's


---------68:44----------
a there's a very common problem here is


---------68:46----------
that if people think oh if i accept my


---------68:48----------
negativity doesn't that do me like if i


---------68:50----------
accept that i feel ashamed about myself


---------68:52----------
does that mean that i'm like never gonna


---------68:54----------
be confident right because if i accept


---------68:56----------
my shame does that mean that like i'm


---------68:58----------
not gonna be confident but something


---------68:59----------
funny happens it's kind of like


---------69:00----------
paradoxical that when you accept the


---------69:03----------
negative things when you embrace that


---------69:05----------
discomfort what happens when you go on


---------69:07----------
stage


---------69:10----------
you you don't feel


---------69:12----------
as


---------69:13----------
uncomfortable it's bizarre right yeah so


---------69:16----------
somehow by embracing and so you've


---------69:18----------
stumbled upon you know a ton of these


---------69:20----------
like i'm telling like 2 000 year old


---------69:22----------
like


---------69:23----------
like you know wise things so that like


---------69:25----------
embracing that discomfort and really


---------69:27----------
saying hey this is where i am like this


---------69:29----------
is i want to carve this out this is what


---------69:31----------
i want to do i don't want to play


---------69:32----------
intramural soccer i want to be here and


---------69:35----------
it's okay to be uncomfortable because


---------69:37----------
this aligns with like the life that i


---------69:39----------
want to live and when you embrace i


---------69:40----------
think that was a really transformative


---------69:42----------
moment for you and i think it's like


---------69:44----------
that acceptance which has been and


---------69:46----------
there's a reason why your brain


---------69:47----------
remembers it right so


---------69:49----------
the reason that you have a vivid memory


---------69:51----------
reason you don't remember anything about


---------69:52----------
your divorce is because it doesn't mean


---------69:54----------
anything to you it's like there's


---------69:55----------
nothing there yes right yeah yeah so


---------69:57----------
like what you do remember the important


---------69:59----------
transformative moments of your life and


---------70:01----------
like i think that was a big one where


---------70:02----------
you learned how to accept


---------70:04----------
like negativity and so if we talk a


---------70:07----------
little bit about getting into the flow


---------70:09----------
state i think you know embracing the


---------70:11----------
negative is a big part


---------70:13----------
of the flow state because in the flow


---------70:15----------
state you've used the phrase natural so


---------70:18----------
how do you get into the flow state as


---------70:20----------
long as you have internal conflict and


---------70:22----------
we can kind of hear this in a lot of


---------70:24----------
what you've said the first is if you're


---------70:26----------
editing the thoughts in your head right


---------70:28----------
no flow state that's internal conflict


---------70:31----------
if you have negative feelings that


---------70:32----------
you're trying to suppress or push away


---------70:35----------
internal conflict you're not going to


---------70:36----------
get a flow state


---------70:38----------
so a big part of the flow state is to be


---------70:40----------
as you put it natural what does that


---------70:42----------
mean to be natural i would argue that


---------70:45----------
feeling natural is not having an


---------70:47----------
internal conflict so if i'm laying out


---------70:50----------
on the beach and not thinking about


---------70:51----------
anything and i feel completely unnatural


---------70:54----------
and i'm alive and in the moment there's


---------70:57----------
no conflict


---------70:58----------
if i'm sitting there in my head thinking


---------71:00----------
about oh my god i'm here on the beach


---------71:01----------
and i have so many bills to pay it's


---------71:03----------
going to create internal conflict and


---------71:05----------
i'm not even going to enjoy being on the


---------71:06----------
beach


---------71:07----------
yeah okay


---------71:09----------
so i think it's really like that that


---------71:11----------
moment that you had there was like a


---------71:14----------
real like you know


---------71:16----------
turning point in a in a movie about


---------71:18----------
success


---------71:19----------
kind of thing it's like when people play


---------71:21----------
the triumphant music and


---------71:23----------
and then you go out on stage


---------71:27----------
and then i think there's another really


---------71:29----------
interesting thing there which is if you


---------71:30----------
talk about the way that you respond to


---------71:33----------
[Music]


---------71:35----------
to


---------71:36----------
how people responded to you so the first


---------71:38----------
set you did you had sounds like not


---------71:40----------
really a whole lot expectation so you


---------71:42----------
were pleasantly surprised or maybe you


---------71:44----------
thought you'd suck you just went up


---------71:45----------
there and people like you you kind of


---------71:47----------
even remember like it's so interesting


---------71:48----------
that you remember what your first set


---------71:50----------
was like what the reception was like


---------71:52----------
what the second set was like what the


---------71:53----------
reception was like first one went really


---------71:55----------
well and then second one


---------71:57----------
it's really interesting because if you


---------71:59----------
pay attention it's beautiful the way


---------72:00----------
that your cognition works because you


---------72:01----------
say


---------72:02----------
it didn't go as well or you said


---------72:04----------
something like it went bad and then you


---------72:06----------
actually rewind it a little bit and you


---------72:08----------
were like actually it was about the same


---------72:10----------
it didn't go that much worse it was like


---------72:12----------
a six out of ten so if we look at those


---------72:14----------
two statements what happens is probably


---------72:16----------
when you went up there the second time


---------72:17----------
you had an expectation hey i'm fine


---------72:21----------
it's gonna go great and it did not go


---------72:23----------
that great and then you felt emotionally


---------72:25----------
like oh my god this is going so much


---------72:27----------
worse and now when you think about that


---------72:30----------
memory in the past the first answer that


---------72:32----------
comes out is that emotional oh crap


---------72:34----------
people aren't laughing as much but then


---------72:36----------
as you start to think about it a little


---------72:38----------
bit more calmly a little bit more


---------72:39----------
intellectually actually it wasn't that


---------72:40----------
big of a difference


---------72:41----------
you know it's just that comparison that


---------72:43----------
you made to the first time


---------72:45----------
and i think it's not surprising because


---------72:46----------
if you want to get into the flow state


---------72:48----------
you can't compare


---------72:50----------
you can't think about how the last


---------72:52----------
stream went you can't expect anything


---------72:54----------
you can't be like oh my god do i have


---------72:56----------
problems like oh my god i don't have


---------72:58----------
problems now what am i going to do if


---------73:00----------
i'm talking to dr k if that is the


---------73:02----------
thought in your head this conversation


---------73:04----------
will never happen


---------73:05----------
yep you gotta go with the flow


---------73:07----------
right


---------73:08----------
so i think that that this too like in


---------73:10----------
that in that moment i think it was a


---------73:13----------
really good like instance


---------73:15----------
of when you have an experience if you


---------73:18----------
create an expectation about the next


---------73:20----------
experience it will actually make it very


---------73:23----------
hard for you to enter this flow state or


---------73:26----------
impossible actually because the flow


---------73:28----------
state is a one-pointedness of the mind


---------73:30----------
and if you are trying to fulfill an


---------73:32----------
expectation


---------73:34----------
your mind is not fully in the task


---------73:36----------
because a small amount of your ram is


---------73:38----------
being spent comparing to like the last


---------73:40----------
time am i there yet am i there yet am i


---------73:42----------
there yet


---------73:44----------
and this is kind of really interesting


---------73:45----------
because when i teach people meditation


---------73:47----------
their first like spiritual trippy


---------73:49----------
psychedelic experience is actually easy


---------73:51----------
to get so when i teach people certain


---------73:53----------
kinds of meditation they'll have these


---------73:54----------
like weird spiritual experiences where


---------73:56----------
they'll be like oh my god it was bizarre


---------73:58----------
i felt connected to the universe i


---------74:00----------
realized whatever or they like have


---------74:02----------
memories from their past life for like


---------74:03----------
weird stuff starts to happen


---------74:05----------
and then the first one is like super


---------74:07----------
easy because they have no idea it's


---------74:08----------
coming so they can enter the flow state


---------74:11----------
in meditation they can attain one


---------74:13----------
pointedness of the mind and then like


---------74:15----------
something weird happens in their


---------74:16----------
consciousness


---------74:17----------
the second time is the hardest


---------74:20----------
because once it happens the first time


---------74:22----------
you sit down to meditate and you're like


---------74:24----------
can't wait let's go let's feel connected


---------74:27----------
to the universe and then like it doesn't


---------74:29----------
happen why am i not feeling connected oh


---------74:30----------
my god oh my god it's not working it's


---------74:32----------
not working it's not working so you


---------74:34----------
create that kind of expectation and then


---------74:36----------
it kind of like shatters the flow state


---------74:39----------
and then kind of the third thing that i


---------74:40----------
wanted to say is we talked about loss of


---------74:42----------
ego


---------74:44----------
one-pointedness not being critical right


---------74:46----------
so as long as you're being critical of


---------74:47----------
yourself it's going to create that


---------74:49----------
tension shatter the flow state and the


---------74:51----------
last thing that i kind of want to say


---------74:52----------
about the flow today is like the words


---------74:53----------
that you use to describe it so we talked


---------74:55----------
about channeling right like you're


---------74:57----------
channeling the therapy gecko and on days


---------75:00----------
that you try to be the therapy gecko i


---------75:02----------
would suspect it's harder to be the


---------75:04----------
therapy gecko


---------75:06----------
hmm


---------75:08----------
actually it's this sort of weird thing


---------75:10----------
where like uh it's funny you say that


---------75:13----------
because uh


---------75:15----------
sometimes uh uh i i do have like uh like


---------75:19----------
like i like to


---------75:21----------
channel


---------75:22----------
the therapy girl and sometimes i feel


---------75:23----------
like if i'm not making


---------75:25----------
a uh intentional decision


---------75:29----------
to to act in a certain way


---------75:32----------
it doesn't happen and then i and then i


---------75:33----------
look back and i'm like


---------75:35----------
oh i was i didn't i didn't like


---------75:37----------
i didn't do that stream in the way that


---------75:40----------
i i wanted to i was too like this way


---------75:42----------
maybe like i laughed too much when like


---------75:44----------
you know i i would have rather been you


---------75:48----------
know


---------75:48----------
sort of more more stoic or something


---------75:50----------
like that so while there's a huge


---------75:53----------
difference i completely agree with you


---------75:55----------
yeah there's a huge difference between


---------75:57----------
intention and expectation


---------76:00----------
sure


---------76:01----------
right so i think that when we talk about


---------76:03----------
the flow state there must absolutely be


---------76:07----------
complete intention one pointed intention


---------76:10----------
all of your intention is to be something


---------76:13----------
and this is where things like even my


---------76:15----------
language is gonna start to fall apart


---------76:16----------
but like


---------76:17----------
intention and expectation are two


---------76:19----------
different things because intention is


---------76:20----------
about what you're putting into it


---------76:22----------
expectation is about what you hope to


---------76:24----------
get out of it yes yeah yeah right so i


---------76:27----------
think there i think when you try too


---------76:30----------
hard to be the therapy gecko you will


---------76:32----------
not actually be the therapy gecko what i


---------76:34----------
would say is when you let yourself


---------76:37----------
become the therapy gecko


---------76:39----------
you will be the best therapy gecko


---------76:41----------
you have to let it take you for a ride


---------76:44----------
you can't you know turn on the engine


---------76:46----------
and just go and tell it where to go you


---------76:48----------
got to let it take you


---------76:52----------
what do you think about that


---------76:54----------
i'll i like that i think that makes a


---------76:56----------
lot of sense


---------76:58----------
letting


---------77:00----------
that's what this that is that's fun that


---------77:02----------
is like meditation where like if you sit


---------77:03----------
down and you're like i'm going to


---------77:06----------
become the


---------77:07----------
one with the worlds or whatever it


---------77:09----------
doesn't work but if you sort of let it


---------77:11----------
happen


---------77:12----------
i'm trying to i'm trying to like i'm


---------77:13----------
thinking about like like last night's


---------77:15----------
stream like because i i felt like i i


---------77:17----------
was very much in the flow state and


---------77:19----------
acting presenting myself in the way that


---------77:21----------
um


---------77:22----------
you know i wanted to you know um


---------77:27----------
and yeah i i would say that's pretty


---------77:29----------
accurate


---------77:31----------
so i i and i think even if you go back


---------77:33----------
to the early part of our stream today


---------77:36----------
and you talk about you know what what


---------77:38----------
it's like when i use the word channel


---------77:40----------
and you started using these words like


---------77:42----------
your being and alive you know like maybe


---------77:45----------
that was my word but


---------77:47----------
the way you were kind of describing it


---------77:48----------
is like


---------77:50----------
you know there's


---------77:52----------
sometimes the you know some of the yogis


---------77:54----------
and zen masters and stuff will describe


---------77:56----------
it as a flowering


---------77:58----------
so the reason i i think they use the


---------78:00----------
word flowering is because you can't like


---------78:02----------
make a flower bloom


---------78:04----------
you know like you can't like if there's


---------78:05----------
a bud like you can't peel it apart and


---------78:08----------
like turn it into a flower it's


---------78:10----------
something that you have to let happen


---------78:12----------
right so it's not something you can do


---------78:13----------
but it's something you have to let


---------78:14----------
happen and this is this is a concept


---------78:16----------
that i think is very very like lost in


---------78:18----------
our society today because we're all


---------78:21----------
about like metrics and performance and


---------78:23----------
like living up to expectations and


---------78:25----------
having job descriptions and like you


---------78:27----------
know you know what's your kpi like how


---------78:30----------
many views are you getting how many subs


---------78:31----------
are you getting we're all like outcome


---------78:33----------
oriented so we don't we've forgotten


---------78:35----------
sort of as a society how to let things


---------78:38----------
bloom


---------78:39----------
right how to set everything up how to


---------78:41----------
you know start making content on the


---------78:42----------
internet at 10 but you didn't care about


---------78:44----------
your views and i mean maybe you did but


---------78:45----------
you're focused on making content then


---------78:47----------
doing stand up and then like is all of


---------78:48----------
these factors kind of go together as you


---------78:50----------
water the plant is you give it sunlight


---------78:52----------
is you give it the right kind of soil


---------78:54----------
and fertilizer eventually something


---------78:55----------
grows and it takes a decade and then you


---------78:58----------
see a flowering it's a happening


---------79:01----------
and so what i i'd kind of say is that


---------79:03----------
when you talk about the flow state this


---------79:05----------
is sort of the last concept that i'll


---------79:06----------
share is there's this idea in in yoga


---------79:09----------
and in meditation that we each have


---------79:11----------
within us a piece of divinity


---------79:14----------
and that gets kind of confusing because


---------79:16----------
people like what the does that mean like


---------79:17----------
does that mean i can move out what does


---------79:19----------
that mean


---------79:20----------
people don't know what divinity is


---------79:22----------
and so i'd say like instead of trying to


---------79:24----------
understand divinity


---------79:26----------
from kind of like an ab like a logical


---------79:29----------
way or abstract way


---------79:31----------
there's something within you that once


---------79:33----------
you channel it like everything is just


---------79:35----------
good baby


---------79:36----------
it's like you feel alive you produce


---------79:38----------
better content you feel happier right


---------79:41----------
it's not like an abstract because you've


---------79:43----------
got the chair it's like a it's like an


---------79:45----------
experience of happiness


---------79:47----------
and it's not even like happiness like


---------79:49----------
you're laughing


---------79:50----------
it's not even emotional right because


---------79:52----------
that's the other thing that confuses


---------79:53----------
people about the word happiness is they


---------79:55----------
correlate happiness with positive


---------79:57----------
emotion but in the flow state what it


---------79:59----------
really is is when you're channeling that


---------80:01----------
divinity that's when you produce work


---------80:04----------
right so like i think it was the greeks


---------80:06----------
that talked about


---------80:07----------
genius is something that like strikes


---------80:09----------
you right so it's like this thing that


---------80:11----------
is not something you aren't a genius you


---------80:14----------
channel genius and so genius is like a


---------80:17----------
state of mind as opposed to a person


---------80:20----------
and so this state of flow like makes you


---------80:22----------
feel happy makes you feel alive not on


---------80:24----------
an emotional level not now i've got at


---------80:26----------
my big chair level but in that moment


---------80:28----------
you feel present you're not thinking


---------80:30----------
about the future you're not thinking


---------80:31----------
about where things are going you're not


---------80:32----------
thinking about metrics you're not


---------80:34----------
worried about whether you're doing a


---------80:35----------
good job or bad job and so what i really


---------80:37----------
call that i think like you've got a


---------80:39----------
taste of that which is like what they


---------80:40----------
just they use the word divinity because


---------80:42----------
they couldn't come up with what that is


---------80:44----------
right so they said that oh each each of


---------80:46----------
us has the spark of the divine because


---------80:48----------
if you look in you look in that moment


---------80:50----------
you're opie


---------80:52----------
right you're performing well you're


---------80:54----------
happier


---------80:55----------
you're like doing a fantastic job and


---------80:57----------
that sounds op so what we're going to


---------80:59----------
call that is the divine


---------81:02----------
and then they also went through a series


---------81:03----------
of like different practices and stuff to


---------81:05----------
cultivate that state to spend more time


---------81:07----------
in that state to advance beyond that


---------81:09----------
state into other states and then


---------81:11----------
eventually you get to something that


---------81:13----------
they called moksha


---------81:14----------
or enlightenment which has all of the


---------81:16----------
features of the crap that you've already


---------81:18----------
been describing like loss of ego and


---------81:20----------
other things like that which i know you


---------81:22----------
said you couldn't explain but i think


---------81:24----------
you did a very good job of because i


---------81:25----------
think you actually understand it because


---------81:26----------
it sounds like you've lived it


---------81:30----------
that's mushfield interesting


---------81:32----------
i said i i this this is making me like


---------81:35----------
what like when people say that like uh


---------81:37----------
you know


---------81:38----------
god told them to paint a


---------81:40----------
picture or something maybe that's like


---------81:42----------
that's their interpretation of


---------81:44----------
that or something it makes a lot of


---------81:46----------
sense


---------81:48----------
interesting thing there is


---------81:50----------
i'm not so sure that that's the case


---------81:52----------
because there's a great book by a guy


---------81:53----------
named


---------81:55----------
william james called the varieties of


---------81:56----------
religious experience and some artists


---------81:58----------
were like mentally ill or possibly


---------82:00----------
psychotic


---------82:02----------
or or maybe they had a spiritual


---------82:04----------
experience


---------82:05----------
like through prayer it's interesting but


---------82:08----------
what i do find is that that um


---------82:11----------
especially with like the creative like


---------82:13----------
people who i i i work with who make


---------82:15----------
music and and write and things like that


---------82:17----------
that they really have to like the more


---------82:19----------
they can cultivate that channeling of


---------82:20----------
divinity the more they sort of almost


---------82:23----------
accept that i can't control it because a


---------82:24----------
big part of like creative folks is that


---------82:26----------
they set themselves up with the


---------82:28----------
expectation of today i have to write


---------82:30----------
like a blockbuster piece of music and if


---------82:33----------
they


---------82:34----------
that expectation will paralyze them


---------82:36----------
whereas if they go back because their


---------82:38----------
first blockbuster came without any


---------82:40----------
expectation of being a blockbuster and


---------82:42----------
they made music for the sake of [ __ ]


---------82:44----------
making music


---------82:45----------
you know and that's what made it a


---------82:47----------
blockbuster and then they try to make a


---------82:48----------
blockbuster and then sometimes they they


---------82:50----------
succeed because it's procedurally


---------82:52----------
generated you know highly processed


---------82:54----------
kind of algorithmically driven stuff


---------82:57----------
it's like netflix is just adding a


---------82:59----------
sprinkling of a homosexual sex scene


---------83:01----------
somewhere in all of their shows you know


---------83:03----------
so sometimes it's driven like that but


---------83:04----------
then you have like you know the real


---------83:06----------
artistry behind certain shows where


---------83:08----------
people are like they're not trying to


---------83:09----------
make a blockbuster they're just trying


---------83:11----------
to tell a story or trying to you know


---------83:14----------
really make something genuine


---------83:18----------
that'll make perfect sense anyway i want


---------83:20----------
to just acknowledge that i've been


---------83:21----------
talking most of the time


---------83:23----------
and just checking with you about how you


---------83:25----------
feel about that like especially over the


---------83:26----------
last half hour or so


---------83:29----------
oh i think i i think that's that's


---------83:32----------
that's fine i uh i always say um like


---------83:35----------
like i already know what i think about


---------83:38----------
things and i know my so i i don't like


---------83:40----------
so i don't talk as much


---------83:42----------
you know especially on like my uh stream


---------83:44----------
and stuff


---------83:45----------
like i'm like you know i don't i already


---------83:46----------
know what i think about things you know


---------83:48----------
but i want to hear what you think


---------83:51----------
yeah i think what's so i would encourage


---------83:54----------
you to maybe share a little bit more


---------83:56----------
lyle because i i think you've happened


---------83:58----------
to stumble upon a lot of answers that


---------84:00----------
people are really looking for


---------84:02----------
um and unless i'm i'm totally misreading


---------84:05----------
you in terms of you know where you are


---------84:06----------
but it sounds to me like you've worked


---------84:08----------
really hard


---------84:09----------
for a long time and it may have looked


---------84:11----------
like non-traditional like heart like


---------84:13----------
it's not like you were sitting there and


---------84:14----------
reading books right but you were like


---------84:16----------
[ __ ] going comedy clubs at the age of


---------84:18----------
16.


---------84:19----------
and having like i see i appreciate you


---------84:21----------
saying that because i i uh


---------84:24----------
you know i i i don't read a lot of books


---------84:26----------
but uh you know i do think a lot about


---------84:29----------
things like you know


---------84:31----------
how to be yourself and accept discomfort


---------84:34----------
and all that and i'm not like uh


---------84:36----------
it's funny that because you know i i do


---------84:37----------
feel like that was a transformative


---------84:39----------
moment that i had when i was 16 and the


---------84:40----------
rock club and everything and um


---------84:43----------
and and and yet weirdly it doesn't like


---------84:45----------
like like that the whole thing of like


---------84:47----------
there is no there


---------84:49----------
like


---------84:49----------
you know i didn't at 16


---------84:52----------
embrace discomfort and then never feel


---------84:54----------
discomfort ever again like you know i i


---------84:57----------
still have times all the time where i'm


---------84:59----------
like


---------84:59----------
you know uncomfortable and i have to


---------85:01----------
just like think of


---------85:02----------
i i feel like i've developed like good


---------85:04----------
concepts for myself of like being


---------85:06----------
yourself and embracing discomfort but


---------85:08----------
they're they're just like concepts that


---------85:10----------
i am like following not so much that i


---------85:13----------
have mastered in any way shape or form


---------85:16----------
they're just like they're they're like


---------85:18----------
they drive me but i i i'm i'm still


---------85:22----------
you know on the on the path to getting


---------85:24----------
better


---------85:25----------
handles on them


---------85:27----------
yeah i think that makes a lot of sense


---------85:28----------
so i think part of the reason that you


---------85:29----------
understand so much is because you


---------85:31----------
haven't read a whole lot


---------85:34----------
what does that mean


---------85:38----------
exactly what it said so so understanding


---------85:41----------
so in the the yogis sort of realize that


---------85:44----------
there are two kinds of knowledge there's


---------85:47----------
vidya which is information which is


---------85:49----------
objective and which is transmissible


---------85:52----------
and then there's understanding


---------85:54----------
which is subjective not transmissible


---------85:58----------
and in in western society we trend tend


---------86:01----------
to rate vidya


---------86:03----------
as more than understanding or nyan which


---------86:06----------
is the other word video is the the


---------86:08----------
information one yeah so we tend to value


---------86:11----------
information over understanding and i


---------86:13----------
know that sounds kind of weird


---------86:15----------
but we want we want we value objectivity


---------86:19----------
over subjectivity but you can


---------86:21----------
understanding is


---------86:22----------
by definition like subjective right it's


---------86:24----------
not yeah like it's just how you


---------86:26----------
understand something right there has to


---------86:28----------
be a subject for understanding there


---------86:30----------
does not have to be a subject for


---------86:32----------
information yeah


---------86:33----------
yeah


---------86:34----------
and and so i think what you've managed


---------86:36----------
to do is like a lot of the things that


---------86:38----------
you're cut like you're stumbling upon


---------86:40----------
the same way that they have stumbled


---------86:42----------
upon for like you know and they kind of


---------86:44----------
came to these conclusions like oh


---------86:45----------
actually it's important to accept your


---------86:47----------
negative emotions it's important to


---------86:50----------
embrace those difficult things and then


---------86:51----------
there's sort of this idea i'm glad you


---------86:53----------
shared this that you know all the video


---------86:55----------
folks who hear the story of you and


---------86:58----------
they're like oh i need to have my


---------86:59----------
transformational moment in the bathroom


---------87:01----------
and then i'll be good then life will be


---------87:03----------
easy then i'll live my life with


---------87:05----------
confidence and i'll crush it and it's


---------87:07----------
like no no no you're still gonna


---------87:08----------
struggle with discomfort you just


---------87:10----------
it doesn't actually make it objectively


---------87:12----------
any better it makes it subjectively


---------87:14----------
better


---------87:15----------
sure yeah that makes sense um


---------87:18----------
yeah that's that that uh that like


---------87:21----------
information over understanding thing i i


---------87:23----------
think it's i think it's really true like


---------87:24----------
uh


---------87:25----------
i don't know i don't i don't have like


---------87:26----------
as much of a handle of like current


---------87:28----------
events as as a lot of people do um and i


---------87:32----------
feel like sort of uh


---------87:34----------
you know i guess in the way that the


---------87:35----------
internet works like everyone's talking


---------87:36----------
about a different thing every five


---------87:38----------
seconds and it's like and i know


---------87:39----------
sometimes i look at that i'm like but


---------87:41----------
there's that's not as interesting to me


---------87:42----------
as like all the problems and [ __ ]


---------87:44----------
that's you know people have been dealing


---------87:46----------
with for for thousands and thousands of


---------87:48----------
years that i don't really see a whole


---------87:49----------
lot of people uh


---------87:50----------
you know talking about you know i don't


---------87:53----------
talk about the current events or stuff


---------87:55----------
like that on on on my stream but like i


---------87:56----------
know that that's


---------87:58----------
sort of like a big driving thing in uh


---------88:01----------
in twitch and internet culture is like


---------88:03----------
you know talking about like oh here's


---------88:05----------
what happens like in the news or here's


---------88:07----------
like this youtuber that's feuding with


---------88:09----------
this youtuber or something like that and


---------88:10----------
uh i'm i'm very anti that and i'm like


---------88:13----------
you know


---------88:15----------
i like i like more sort of like uh uh


---------88:18----------
timeless or or broad concepts you know i


---------88:21----------
like talking about that more than that


---------88:23----------
kind of stuff i don't know what i just


---------88:24----------
said is related to anything that we were


---------88:27----------
talking about just now but uh that's how


---------88:29----------
i think about stuff


---------88:31----------
yeah so here's kind of what i heard i


---------88:33----------
heard that


---------88:34----------
um


---------88:36----------
you know you like to focus not so much


---------88:39----------
on like information but on like


---------88:41----------
understanding related stuff right so not


---------88:43----------
like what's going on and just


---------88:44----------
propagating and sharing like oh this is


---------88:46----------
going on here there this is kind of like


---------88:48----------
factual sort of objective kind of like


---------88:50----------
stuff


---------88:51----------
um and i i'm not surprised and what i


---------88:53----------
said what i meant by you know i think


---------88:55----------
it's because you don't have information


---------88:56----------
that you have understanding it's because


---------88:58----------
you don't read a lot that you understand


---------88:59----------
so much because i think what happens is


---------89:01----------
when people read something


---------89:03----------
they form an idea of it which can


---------89:06----------
sometimes actually get in the way of


---------89:07----------
understanding and the best example i can


---------89:09----------
think of is when people talk about sex


---------89:12----------
so like i remember when i was like 13


---------89:14----------
and my friends and i were like all


---------89:16----------
talking about sex and how amazing it is


---------89:18----------
and like you know you'll see like


---------89:19----------
everyone talking about sex and different


---------89:22----------
you know communities and stuff and then


---------89:24----------
like people will form notions of


---------89:26----------
sexuality or virginity or like what it's


---------89:28----------
supposed to be like or whatever and then


---------89:30----------
when when you actually start you know


---------89:32----------
having sex like


---------89:34----------
some of those preconceived notions that


---------89:36----------
you may get from watching pornography or


---------89:38----------
having conversations with people is like


---------89:40----------
can actually get in the way of you


---------89:43----------
understanding and appreciating the


---------89:44----------
experience for what it is


---------89:47----------
and once you start having sex and you


---------89:49----------
kind of become comfortable with it and


---------89:51----------
hopefully you have


---------89:52----------
you know a partner or more that that can


---------89:54----------
you guys can kind of explore things and


---------89:56----------
discover it kind of your own way then


---------89:58----------
you have your own understanding of it


---------90:00----------
which may be like completely foreign to


---------90:01----------
what you see in the pornos


---------90:03----------
but like the people in the pornos


---------90:05----------
may have lots of information about it


---------90:07----------
right like they have all this external


---------90:09----------
understanding


---------90:10----------
and oftentimes we see this a lot in


---------90:12----------
spirituality too like sometimes i'll get


---------90:14----------
people who are like read a bunch of


---------90:16----------
books on spirituality and they'll say


---------90:18----------
things like oh i'm gonna like live in


---------90:20----------
the moment so living in the moment means


---------90:21----------
i get to put my dick wherever i want to


---------90:23----------
when i feel like it and if if my


---------90:25----------
girlfriend has a problem with that well


---------90:27----------
that's just her being full of attachment


---------90:29----------
and she needs to be free and like


---------90:31----------
embrace her pain and


---------90:33----------
because if she embraced her pain and


---------90:34----------
embraced her discomfort it wouldn't be a


---------90:36----------
problem for her so like i'm going to


---------90:37----------
continue putting my dick wherever she


---------90:39----------
wants to wherever i want to and then if


---------90:40----------
she has a problem with it i'm living in


---------90:42----------
the moment i'm living in the present i'm


---------90:44----------
being happy i'm being me


---------90:46----------
and she's the one who's not un able to


---------90:48----------
embrace


---------90:49----------
her


---------90:50----------
discomfort


---------90:51----------
so they'll like take all these concepts


---------90:53----------
and like


---------90:54----------
sort of use them as rationalization or


---------90:57----------
justification


---------90:58----------
to propagate whatever negativity they're


---------91:01----------
propagating


---------91:03----------
and so i think on the other hand you've


---------91:05----------
just discovered on your own so like you


---------91:07----------
actually have sort of a like an


---------91:08----------
untouched understanding of things which


---------91:11----------
is great


---------91:12----------
i'm not surprised that


---------91:13----------
your stream is


---------91:14----------
successful well i appreciate that it's


---------91:17----------
uh i i started talking about this


---------91:18----------
earlier where it's like you know when


---------91:19----------
you're talking about the the the reading


---------91:20----------
versus the sort of something on the


---------91:22----------
things of my own it's like uh


---------91:25----------
you know sometimes i like think about


---------91:26----------
[ __ ] and i'll be like uh and if you


---------91:28----------
don't if like if you read something like


---------91:29----------
if something is presented to you within


---------91:32----------
the binds of a book or like it's being


---------91:34----------
said by some you know guy on the


---------91:36----------
internet who has a bunch of followers or


---------91:38----------
something it's like it's it's it's very


---------91:40----------
it's you you can accept it as more valid


---------91:43----------
than a thought that you stumble upon on


---------91:45----------
your own


---------91:46----------
so you know it it's uh


---------91:48----------
it's difficult to like val like validate


---------91:51----------
your own


---------91:52----------
thoughts


---------91:53----------
you know as opposed to your own like


---------91:55----------
thoughts and understandings as opposed


---------91:56----------
to like information that is presented to


---------91:59----------
you even though you know all information


---------92:01----------
just comes from just some other [ __ ]


---------92:02----------
person who understood it on their own


---------92:04----------
you know accord


---------92:06----------
well i think if you really tunnel down


---------92:08----------
there there's like a nuance there that's


---------92:10----------
pretty important which is that you keep


---------92:11----------
on using the words information and


---------92:13----------
understanding


---------92:15----------
so information can be validated


---------92:17----------
understanding cannot


---------92:19----------
but you can sort of validate it


---------92:20----------
internally


---------92:22----------
but when that person is actually


---------92:23----------
propagating is information and you


---------92:25----------
shouldn't compare your their information


---------92:28----------
to your understanding


---------92:29----------
ultimately i think the the reason i


---------92:32----------
share information is to catalyze


---------92:35----------
people's understanding


---------92:37----------
so and nothing i've said today is


---------92:38----------
correct it's just a framework


---------92:42----------
right so like i i really appreciated a


---------92:44----------
lot of what you said and i just sort of


---------92:45----------
tied it into things that i've read


---------92:47----------
because i thought it was like it's a


---------92:48----------
really cool example of like you know


---------92:50----------
last time i checked you haven't spent


---------92:51----------
you know years studying religious texts


---------92:53----------
so it's really awesome and it's actually


---------92:55----------
quite validating for me


---------92:57----------
to hear someone who's not formally


---------92:59----------
trained in any of this stuff start to


---------93:01----------
describe these experiences because


---------93:02----------
that's like oh wow like this is really


---------93:04----------
cool this person has not been polluted


---------93:07----------
by religious study and yet


---------93:09----------
they are coming up with these


---------93:10----------
conclusions so this actually gives me


---------93:12----------
more faith in what i've read because it


---------93:14----------
sounds like you kind of figured this


---------93:15----------
stuff out on your own which means that


---------93:17----------
it's more likely to be true because


---------93:18----------
anything that's true someone should be


---------93:20----------
able to figure out on their own


---------93:23----------
i love that that's that's pretty wild


---------93:28----------
yeah i don't know what you were


---------93:28----------
expecting today and i apologize if i you


---------93:30----------
know dominated the conversation oh oh no


---------93:33----------
i expected absolutely nothing i am


---------93:35----------
actually to be honest i'm like uh you


---------93:37----------
know


---------93:39----------
you know i i


---------93:41----------
when you sort of brought up the fact


---------93:42----------
like oh we don't have to like go in and


---------93:44----------
like find it because i guess i wasn't


---------93:45----------
expecting to like


---------93:47----------
try to find a problem with me yeah or


---------93:51----------
anything because i i don't think i have


---------93:52----------
like anything that's sort of glaring so


---------93:54----------
i'm glad that we've been able to have uh


---------93:56----------
a very great conversation without uh you


---------94:00----------
know having to do that


---------94:02----------
yeah


---------94:03----------
i mean i i think one of my teachers once


---------94:06----------
told me that you know you should have


---------94:07----------
the conversation in the room that you


---------94:09----------
need to have


---------94:11----------
and that's not always a conversation


---------94:13----------
about negative emotions


---------94:15----------
right it's like


---------94:16----------
our purpose here is to educate and


---------94:17----------
sometimes that education involves the


---------94:19----------
exploration of people's problems and


---------94:21----------
sometimes like today i think it involves


---------94:23----------
the exploration of their successes


---------94:26----------
that's awesome


---------94:30----------
any questions for me i feel like i i'm


---------94:32----------
kind of


---------94:33----------
i got out what i wanted what i felt was


---------94:35----------
appropriate


---------94:36----------
um cool i don't really have much else to


---------94:38----------
say but i'm happy to continue talking


---------94:40----------
for a little bit longer if you have


---------94:42----------
thoughts or questions that you want to


---------94:43----------
share


---------94:44----------
uh lots of questions that i want to


---------94:48----------
share um


---------94:52----------
i don't know i guess


---------94:56----------
nothing nothing nothing nothing strikes


---------94:57----------
to mind


---------94:58----------
off the bet


---------95:00----------
so is there anything from the chat i


---------95:02----------
don't know how often you


---------95:04----------
check so i i i think it's now is a great


---------95:07----------
time to check in with chat


---------95:10----------
sure


---------95:12----------
i usually try to once again to not break


---------95:14----------
the flow state i try to steer clear of


---------95:17----------
chat while i'm interviewing people yeah


---------95:20----------
that's that's that's another thing too


---------95:21----------
is like uh i i i don't look at chat when


---------95:24----------
i'm like on the i used to look a chat


---------95:25----------
while i was on the phone with people and


---------95:27----------
then like the chats the way that the


---------95:29----------
chat would like make judgments about the


---------95:31----------
person that i'm talking to the phone on


---------95:32----------
would like get into my head and i hated


---------95:34----------
that because i wanted to form my own


---------95:36----------
you know relationship with the person on


---------95:38----------
the phone so i stopped doing that


---------95:40----------
can the gecko levitate


---------95:43----------
can i levitate


---------95:46----------
um


---------95:47----------
there's price for that


---------95:49----------
so so there's a little bit of context


---------95:51----------
there lyle


---------95:52----------
in that context is yesterday we were


---------95:55----------
just talking a little bit about


---------95:56----------
meditation and there's an old text on


---------95:59----------
meditation that talks about how to


---------96:01----------
levitate


---------96:02----------
um


---------96:03----------
and so it's just it's actually like


---------96:05----------
considered by most scholars to be the


---------96:08----------
most important text


---------96:10----------
like historically about meditation or


---------96:12----------
yoga and and there's an entire chapter


---------96:15----------
in there about developing supernatural


---------96:17----------
powers


---------96:18----------
you know anyone that can levitate


---------96:28----------
um i'm gonna decline to answer that


---------96:30----------
question


---------96:32----------
um


---------96:36----------
is that okay of course


---------96:39----------
okay


---------96:40----------
um so someone's asking how do you go


---------96:42----------
about getting rid of expectations that


---------96:44----------
prevent the flow state


---------96:48----------
how do i go about getting rid of


---------96:50----------
expectations that prevent the flow


---------96:51----------
states


---------96:55----------
i don't know i i think i've recently


---------96:57----------
i've i've tried to make a better um


---------96:59----------
go at like recognizing those and just


---------97:01----------
deciding to


---------97:03----------
not give a [ __ ] about them like um


---------97:06----------
like i was like recently like you know


---------97:09----------
like before i go on a stream i'll just


---------97:10----------
be like i i don't i don't care how many


---------97:12----------
people are watching i don't care about


---------97:12----------
this i don't care about that i don't


---------97:13----------
care about this but i don't care about


---------97:14----------
that all i care about like i actually


---------97:16----------
sort of have a little


---------97:18----------
i you could call it a mental ritual of


---------97:20----------
like you know looking at myself in the


---------97:21----------
mirror and going all i'm going to focus


---------97:23----------
on


---------97:24----------
is my conversation with the person that


---------97:26----------
i'm talking to on the phone


---------97:27----------
um


---------97:29----------
and not any like you know looking at


---------97:32----------
view or chat or anything like that


---------97:35----------
um


---------97:35----------
[Music]


---------97:37----------
that's how i do it with this in this


---------97:38----------
particular case but uh


---------97:42----------
that's that's a great answer um


---------97:46----------
so i i just to kind of add one or two


---------97:48----------
kind of thoughts onto that one is i


---------97:50----------
think that


---------97:51----------
so if you listen to lyle he says he has


---------97:54----------
a ritual right so the subtle thing there


---------97:56----------
is that i think this is practiced


---------97:58----------
so like the more time so the first time


---------98:00----------
they've been in the bathroom when you


---------98:02----------
were 16


---------98:03----------
but


---------98:04----------
what i'm hearing is that you actually


---------98:06----------
have like a cognitive process that's


---------98:08----------
almost like working out


---------98:10----------
where you're like using your cognitive


---------98:11----------
muscles to let go of that expectation


---------98:14----------
um yeah


---------98:16----------
so i'd say for people who are struggling


---------98:18----------
like maybe start with or do you actually


---------98:21----------
look in the mirror like do you literally


---------98:22----------
look in the mirror


---------98:24----------
sometimes i literally look in the mirror


---------98:25----------
if if there's a mirror um


---------98:28----------
what do you say to yourself


---------98:30----------
i just say to myself like i don't think


---------98:32----------
like you know i i don't i don't have


---------98:34----------
like a like a mantra or anything like


---------98:35----------
that but i just sort of generally think


---------98:37----------
to myself like you know don't worry


---------98:39----------
about views don't worry about like you


---------98:41----------
know


---------98:42----------
chat or don't worry about job or like


---------98:43----------
how you're being don't worry about like


---------98:44----------
anything other than


---------98:46----------
trying to have uh you know a good


---------98:48----------
conversation


---------98:49----------
um and it is it is uh


---------98:53----------
it's it's weird getting because like


---------98:54----------
it's weird getting asked about like how


---------98:57----------
to rid myself negative expectations for


---------98:59----------
two reasons one is that i totally


---------99:01----------
i i i never ever ever want to present


---------99:04----------
myself as like


---------99:05----------
an expert on anything because everything


---------99:08----------
that like like getting like you know


---------99:10----------
getting rid of negative expectations


---------99:11----------
like not negative but just getting rid


---------99:13----------
of expectations something like i'm


---------99:15----------
trying to do i present it like like that


---------99:18----------
concept i present is like uh


---------99:20----------
something that i'm trying to do not


---------99:21----------
something that i've like mastered or


---------99:23----------
anything like that uh


---------99:25----------
but then two like uh


---------99:27----------
what i have like any any work that i


---------99:29----------
have done


---------99:30----------
on that uh is very much just like


---------99:33----------
putting in like reps of it i think


---------99:38----------
what's wrong with presenting yourself as


---------99:40----------
an expert


---------99:46----------
what does that mean to present yourself


---------99:47----------
as an expert


---------99:50----------
are you presenting yourself as an expert


---------99:52----------
i don't know i just like


---------99:55----------
i this see this is a sort of a thing


---------99:57----------
that i get into on my stream maybe now


---------99:58----------
we could talk about like the whole uh


---------100:00----------
thing of um


---------100:01----------
you know i don't really i know the show


---------100:04----------
is called therapy gecko


---------100:06----------
and it is like


---------100:08----------
it's i don't i don't like calling it an


---------100:10----------
advice show for that particular reason


---------100:13----------
that i feel like to have an advice show


---------100:15----------
you inherently have to present yourself


---------100:17----------
as like


---------100:18----------
i know things ask me for advice because


---------100:21----------
i will give you the answer because i


---------100:23----------
know


---------100:24----------
you know and i hate doing that um


---------100:26----------
i guess what's wrong with that um


---------100:30----------
i don't know it it it feels like a


---------100:32----------
disingenuous way to present myself i


---------100:35----------
guess


---------100:36----------
i think that makes a lot of sense so i


---------100:38----------
think disingenually presenting yourself


---------100:40----------
as an expert is probably not a good idea


---------100:43----------
and at the same time lyle i would


---------100:45----------
encourage you that you know if someone


---------100:46----------
asks you a question


---------100:48----------
yeah that you know when you give your


---------100:50----------
answer you can give it as not an expert


---------100:54----------
or you can give it


---------100:56----------
lateral to the axis of expert


---------100:59----------
right you can just give your answer


---------101:01----------
and let it be what it is and let them


---------101:04----------
just share what you have to share


---------101:07----------
you know maybe that's something you know


---------101:09----------
i actually kind of like you know i have


---------101:12----------
a thing with is like how do i


---------101:14----------
how do i like


---------101:17----------
you know i have all these people like


---------101:18----------
you know who will sometimes like call me


---------101:20----------
and ask me for advice


---------101:22----------
and i'm like how do i balance the fact


---------101:23----------
that like maybe i have an idea of


---------101:25----------
something i want to tell them


---------101:27----------
but i don't want to present it as the


---------101:29----------
golden answer but then like you know if


---------101:31----------
if i'm gonna be like you know if people


---------101:33----------
are gonna ask me stuff like i i should i


---------101:36----------
should present myself


---------101:38----------
i should answer things confidently and


---------101:40----------
not like give up on my thoughts because


---------101:42----------
they're not validated but the same hand


---------101:45----------
like you know on on the same thing it's


---------101:47----------
like i don't


---------101:48----------
i don't like to feel like i know


---------101:50----------
anything you know it's that whole thing


---------101:52----------
of like you know all i know is that no


---------101:53----------
nothing and all that uh


---------101:55----------
like


---------101:57----------
i think that's a problem so that's your


---------101:59----------
ego interesting


---------102:00----------
okay so your ego is uncomfortable


---------102:03----------
with the idea of presenting yourself as


---------102:07----------
someone who knows things


---------102:09----------
but i would say that you are neither


---------102:11----------
someone who knows things or someone who


---------102:13----------
doesn't know things you just are what


---------102:15----------
you are


---------102:16----------
yeah and i i think you've actually done


---------102:18----------
this really well because i think that


---------102:20----------
i think you should so i would encourage


---------102:21----------
you to just step away from all that crap


---------102:24----------
and just share when people call in just


---------102:27----------
give them whatever is inside


---------102:29----------
right channel that get like just share


---------102:31----------
whatever you've got down there because i


---------102:33----------
think there's a reason why people are


---------102:34----------
calling you and by the way i don't know


---------102:37----------
if you know this but


---------102:38----------
wearing a gecko costume and painting


---------102:40----------
your face green i think makes it pretty


---------102:42----------
clear to people that they're talking to


---------102:45----------
someone who's like


---------102:47----------
they're talking to a guy who dresses up


---------102:49----------
as a [ __ ] gecko


---------102:50----------
i i'm not afraid of i'm not afraid of


---------102:52----------
i'm not afraid of accidentally present


---------102:54----------
i'm not afraid of accidentally


---------102:55----------
accidentally presenting myself as


---------102:56----------
literally a professional i think


---------102:58----------
everyone who calls me yeah knows that


---------103:00----------
i'm not like actually a real thing but


---------103:02----------
it's more like in the


---------103:04----------
but but


---------103:05----------
what i'm saying is like i think you you


---------103:07----------
clearly are presenting yourself is just


---------103:09----------
you so just give them you


---------103:12----------
and if you if you you don't you don't


---------103:14----------
have to offer a disclaimer that i'm not


---------103:15----------
of an expert on this


---------103:18----------
i mean just look at you bro


---------103:20----------
right like i don't i think you go out of


---------103:22----------
your way sure to make it clear to people


---------103:25----------
that you're just a dude in a gecko


---------103:27----------
costume which paradoxically


---------103:30----------
i think like the more that you embrace


---------103:32----------
that authenticity the closer to the


---------103:34----------
divinity that you get and don't let


---------103:36----------
yourself edit what you're about to say


---------103:39----------
because of the concern that you could


---------103:40----------
come across as an expert because that's


---------103:42----------
going to shatter the flow state


---------103:44----------
so if someone calls


---------103:46----------
into a show on twitch where there's a


---------103:48----------
guy who's dressed up in a green gecko


---------103:50----------
costume


---------103:52----------
i don't think you have to worry about


---------103:54----------
like overselling your qualifications i


---------103:56----------
think you just give them what they're


---------103:57----------
calling this in for


---------103:59----------
because it's good [ __ ]


---------104:01----------
there's kind of another thing of like


---------104:03----------
and i and i i think i've been able to


---------104:04----------
recognize the fact that like you know if


---------104:06----------
people didn't want


---------104:08----------
my whatever on whatever they wouldn't


---------104:10----------
have called in but then there's a thing


---------104:11----------
where like


---------104:12----------
i think


---------104:14----------
if if i okay i feel like if i can give


---------104:16----------
good advice on something you know


---------104:18----------
there's this expectation i could give


---------104:20----------
good advice on anything like like like


---------104:21----------
if i have an 18 year old college student


---------104:23----------
call in and go


---------104:25----------
how do i make friends in college i feel


---------104:28----------
like i could actually


---------104:29----------
really like talk with that guy and like


---------104:31----------
give some you know what i what i would


---------104:33----------
feel is good advice but then if someone


---------104:36----------
calls in is like


---------104:37----------
uh i'm 38 years old and i'm about to be


---------104:40----------
a mother for the first time do you have


---------104:42----------
any advice on that no


---------104:44----------
i don't and i want to be comfortable


---------104:45----------
with the ability to be like


---------104:47----------
yeah for that specific thing i i i have


---------104:50----------
nothing to say about that


---------104:52----------
you know


---------104:53----------
um so we can talk because


---------104:55----------
that is that is what i say yeah


---------104:57----------
i think that's beautiful


---------104:59----------
so i think you could say i'm i'm a 22 23


---------105:01----------
year old 22 year old dude


---------105:03----------
yeah in a gecko costume


---------105:05----------
and unfortunately i don't know how to


---------105:07----------
advise you about being a 38 year old


---------105:09----------
mother for the first time


---------105:11----------
but i'd love to talk to you for a few


---------105:13----------
minutes


---------105:14----------
you know and this is where you can toss


---------105:16----------
out you know question like what are you


---------105:18----------
afraid of


---------105:19----------
what are you concerned about


---------105:21----------
that's what i that's what i kind of do


---------105:22----------
if i get into a situation like that is


---------105:24----------
like i'll just ask them questions and


---------105:26----------
not like


---------105:27----------
try to


---------105:28----------
give advice or anything just sort of


---------105:30----------
beautiful


---------105:31----------
i've been told um


---------105:33----------
sometimes i'll get someone like who's


---------105:35----------
like a real therapist and this is kind


---------105:37----------
of sort of what happened with this where


---------105:39----------
it's like someone who's a real therapist


---------105:41----------
would be like hey you might not know


---------105:42----------
this but what you're doing is like this


---------105:44----------
thing called motivational interviewing


---------105:46----------
and then i'll like go and look at that


---------105:47----------
and i'll be like oh that's kind of


---------105:48----------
interesting so that's like what i'll


---------105:50----------
like uh just you know


---------105:53----------
ask questions instead of trying to give


---------105:54----------
advice or anything like that


---------105:58----------
yeah so i i think something you know


---------106:00----------
weird has happened if you look at the


---------106:02----------
research on therapy


---------106:04----------
so people will will do studies and


---------106:06----------
they'll look at like


---------106:07----------
different kinds of therapies so you'll


---------106:09----------
have like different kinds of therapy


---------106:10----------
like very


---------106:11----------
drastically different you'll have


---------106:13----------
mindfulness-based therapies you'll have


---------106:15----------
cognitive behavioral therapy you'll have


---------106:17----------
psychoanalysis


---------106:18----------
and like those are like very different


---------106:20----------
one is like worksheets and homework and


---------106:22----------
stuff like that and the other one is


---------106:23----------
like laying down on the couch where dude


---------106:25----------
sits behind you and doesn't a woman sits


---------106:27----------
behind you doesn't say anything for


---------106:30----------
four hours a week right those are very


---------106:32----------
different like worksheets and homework


---------106:34----------
and so people were kind of curious


---------106:35----------
because if you look at most of the


---------106:37----------
therapies


---------106:39----------
they tend to have comparable outcomes so


---------106:41----------
if i have depression


---------106:42----------
and this is sort of an over


---------106:44----------
generalization and i go see a


---------106:45----------
psychoanalyst for four hours a week or i


---------106:47----------
go see a cvt therapist for one hour a


---------106:49----------
week it turns out that generally


---------106:51----------
speaking i get the same amount of batter


---------106:53----------
and so then people got really confused


---------106:55----------
because they're like which kind of


---------106:56----------
therapy is best


---------106:57----------
turns out that they're all comparable


---------106:59----------
and then people are like how the hell


---------107:00----------
does that work because they're doing


---------107:01----------
such drastically different things


---------107:04----------
and then what they sort of discovered is


---------107:06----------
that


---------107:07----------
they did something called common factors


---------107:09----------
research and what they sort of realized


---------107:10----------
is that like if you look at what is


---------107:12----------
responsible for the improvement it isn't


---------107:15----------
a particular modality it's a set of what


---------107:17----------
they call common factors that are


---------107:19----------
universal to all therapy


---------107:21----------
so one of those things is for example


---------107:23----------
like being a good listener


---------107:25----------
and so then the really interesting thing


---------107:27----------
is that if you look at some of those


---------107:28----------
common factors of of therapy what you


---------107:31----------
discover is that there are a lot of


---------107:32----------
other situations where those common


---------107:34----------
factors apply right so like you don't


---------107:37----------
have to be a therapist to be a good


---------107:39----------
listener


---------107:40----------
you don't have to be a therapist to like


---------107:42----------
you know answer questions and provide


---------107:44----------
advice and try to help people understand


---------107:46----------
themselves we have a lot of different


---------107:49----------
professions and situations you do it


---------107:51----------
with your friends


---------107:52----------
bartenders are famous for doing this


---------107:54----------
stuff right like you go and you talk to


---------107:56----------
your bartender and your bartender is


---------107:58----------
like actually like a trained listener


---------107:59----------
it's like part of their job


---------108:01----------
you know sometimes in religious


---------108:03----------
professions and things like that you'll


---------108:04----------
get you know folks who are like you know


---------108:06----------
will offer counsel and advice and will


---------108:09----------
ask like important questions and stuff


---------108:10----------
like that there's also the field of


---------108:12----------
coaching which is emerging and one of


---------108:14----------
the core competencies of coaching is


---------108:16----------
what they call asking powerful questions


---------108:19----------
and so i'm not surprised that you know


---------108:22----------
what you were doing has been described


---------108:24----------
in therapy but i don't know that that i


---------108:27----------
mean i think that long before there was


---------108:29----------
therapy people were asking


---------108:31----------
questions of each other


---------108:33----------
yes that were like impactful and help


---------108:36----------
people were like emotionally supporting


---------108:38----------
themselves like each other like


---------108:39----------
long before there was therapy


---------108:42----------
and so now you have like narrative


---------108:43----------
therapy and art therapy like people were


---------108:45----------
[ __ ] painting on in caves for like


---------108:48----------
thousands of years and chances are it


---------108:50----------
was therapeutic so it's kind of like i


---------108:52----------
think you got to be careful when it


---------108:53----------
comes to therapy because i'm not


---------108:54----------
surprised that people are saying hey


---------108:55----------
you're doing something called


---------108:56----------
motivational interviewing like how do


---------108:58----------
people come up with motivational


---------108:59----------
interviewing


---------109:00----------
it's because they observed the things


---------109:02----------
that regular humans do that like seemed


---------109:04----------
to help motivate people


---------109:06----------
and they kind of like figured that out


---------109:09----------
and then they codified it and formalized


---------109:11----------
it and figured out where the money is


---------109:12----------
and things like that but i'm not


---------109:14----------
surprised at all that you know


---------109:17----------
the irony of you calling yourself a


---------109:19----------
therapist and winding up doing something


---------109:21----------
that looks a lot like therapy but i


---------109:23----------
think that's more just because it's not


---------109:25----------
that it's therapy it's just that there's


---------109:26----------
a lot of basic human stuff that for some


---------109:29----------
reason therapy has seemed to like claim


---------109:32----------
yeah


---------109:32----------
i think we also see this in things like


---------109:34----------
alcoholics anonymous where like you know


---------109:36----------
people do a lot of things that inter


---------109:38----------
they do a lot of interventions with each


---------109:39----------
other they're not trained in therapy but


---------109:41----------
they do lead to positive clinical


---------109:43----------
outcomes in addiction improvement and


---------109:45----------
they like emotionally support each other


---------109:47----------
and they're there for each other but


---------109:48----------
that doesn't mean that they're doing


---------109:49----------
therapy it just means they're being


---------109:51----------
emotionally supportive


---------109:52----------
but somewhere along the way i think that


---------109:53----------
that definition got kind of muddled


---------109:56----------
but anyway it's just because i one of


---------109:58----------
the big things that i like if um and


---------110:01----------
again i don't i i hate the idea of like


---------110:03----------
centering um my


---------110:05----------
like


---------110:06----------
i don't i don't like referring to it as


---------110:07----------
an advice show it's more of like a i'd


---------110:09----------
call it a chat


---------110:10----------
show more than advice but um


---------110:13----------
typically like if someone ever does come


---------110:14----------
to me with like something that i i feel


---------110:16----------
like is absolutely 100 above you know my


---------110:18----------
pay grade uh the question i'll ask them


---------110:20----------
is like


---------110:21----------
do you have a real therapist and what


---------110:23----------
did they say about this when you


---------110:25----------
told them i've always wondered like what


---------110:27----------
like uh


---------110:30----------
you know


---------110:32----------
how does how does a like like sometimes


---------110:34----------
people come to me thinks i'm like i have


---------110:35----------
no idea


---------110:36----------
how the hell to respond to this in any


---------110:38----------
way shape or form and i'm like what what


---------110:40----------
what do you learn in like


---------110:42----------
psychology


---------110:44----------
school or whatever that like teaches you


---------110:46----------
how to like respond to these


---------110:49----------
things you know


---------110:52----------
so i'd say there are like two things


---------110:54----------
that you learn


---------110:55----------
one is like if you look at the


---------110:57----------
curriculum right so if you look at


---------110:59----------
curriculums for


---------111:01----------
therapy


---------111:02----------
so if you become like i'm a medical


---------111:04----------
doctor so that the curriculum that i


---------111:06----------
went to with through was like psychiatry


---------111:08----------
which is like the practice of medicine


---------111:10----------
that is focused on


---------111:11----------
pathology relating to the mind


---------111:14----------
right so we are i'm a medical doctor


---------111:16----------
which means that i treat patients who


---------111:18----------
have something busted and so a


---------111:20----------
cardiologist will work with people whose


---------111:22----------
heart is messed up you know an


---------111:23----------
endocrinologist will work with people


---------111:25----------
like diabetes a pediatrician will work


---------111:27----------
with children i will work with people


---------111:28----------
who have trouble with their mind so we


---------111:30----------
get training in pathology so we'll get


---------111:33----------
training in like bipolar disorder major


---------111:35----------
depressive disorder generalized anxiety


---------111:37----------
disorder and then people get a little


---------111:39----------
bit confused because remember that


---------111:40----------
sadness and depression and anxiety are


---------111:43----------
all normal human experiences what do we


---------111:45----------
get trained in we get trained in the


---------111:47----------
pathological version of those right so


---------111:49----------
when anxiety reaches a particular


---------111:51----------
threshold where it in interferes with


---------111:54----------
your ability to function as a human


---------111:56----------
being


---------111:56----------
then you get diagnosed with a disorder


---------111:58----------
so we see those people


---------112:01----------
so that's kind of what our formal


---------112:02----------
training is in right so it's like mostly


---------112:04----------
in pathology and stuff like that


---------112:06----------
then the other thing that i'd say you


---------112:08----------
learn which is not necessarily something


---------112:10----------
that you get trained in


---------112:12----------
but you know when you become a


---------112:13----------
psychiatrist or a therapist when you do


---------112:15----------
clinical work you just get experience


---------112:17----------
sitting with people who are going


---------112:19----------
through really bad [ __ ]


---------112:21----------
yeah


---------112:22----------
and and i think that like you know


---------112:24----------
that's not really a formal part of your


---------112:26----------
training like it's not like there's a


---------112:28----------
class for you know how to deal with


---------112:31----------
people whose life is just awful


---------112:34----------
now you can diagnose with them with


---------112:35----------
trauma or whatever but like you know one


---------112:37----------
of my


---------112:38----------
one of the best nurses that i worked


---------112:40----------
with


---------112:40----------
she would sometimes say she was an er


---------112:43----------
nurse and she would i ask her you know


---------112:45----------
what what is the patient in room 12 like


---------112:47----------
what's going on with them and then she


---------112:48----------
had this acronym sls which is [ __ ] life


---------112:51----------
syndrome


---------112:52----------
and you can call it like some kind of


---------112:55----------
you know depression or bipolar disorder


---------112:57----------
or whatever but like we just sometimes


---------112:58----------
get these kids in the emergency room


---------113:00----------
like their 17 year old kid has been like


---------113:02----------
in foster care for 12 years sexually


---------113:04----------
abused at the age of four


---------113:06----------
you know just like really terrible stuff


---------113:09----------
has behavioral problems has substance


---------113:11----------
use problems


---------113:13----------
you know has like it went to juvie for a


---------113:15----------
year and like what's the kid's problem


---------113:17----------
the kid's problem is that they had a


---------113:19----------
[ __ ] life


---------113:20----------
like it's not like they're ill like sure


---------113:22----------
they have manifestations of illness and


---------113:24----------
they have trouble like you know


---------113:25----------
following rules and like they have


---------113:27----------
intermittent explosive kind of problems


---------113:29----------
but the problem is like they've just had


---------113:30----------
like


---------113:31----------
they've got a really crappy spawn you


---------113:34----------
know that's the real problem if you want


---------113:35----------
to blame something it's just like the


---------113:37----------
circumstances of their [ __ ] life it's


---------113:38----------
not really their fault


---------113:40----------
and so the other thing that i think you


---------113:41----------
learn as a clinician is when you you


---------113:43----------
know when you work in hospitals for four


---------113:45----------
years and you sit with those kinds of


---------113:47----------
people and you like talk to them and you


---------113:48----------
get to know them


---------113:49----------
it allows you to be able to like handle


---------113:52----------
and sit with things that as you call it


---------113:55----------
or above your pay grade because you just


---------113:56----------
because what else are you going to do


---------113:57----------
like you're the one who's on call that


---------113:59----------
kid is there you've got to go in and try


---------114:01----------
to help them


---------114:02----------
and so you just show up and you kind of


---------114:04----------
do the best that you can and i think a


---------114:05----------
lot of it is really just trial by fire


---------114:09----------
and


---------114:10----------
you know i'd say that


---------114:11----------
the most important thing that i learned


---------114:13----------
with kids with [ __ ] life syndrome is not


---------114:14----------
to be a clinician it's to be a human


---------114:17----------
and that's what they need more than


---------114:18----------
anything else


---------114:19----------
interesting i like that


---------114:22----------
and i think that you're fully qualified


---------114:23----------
to do you can be human sure sure sure


---------114:27----------
even though you're a gecko


---------114:30----------
um


---------114:31----------
no it's it's uh it's it's we're actually


---------114:33----------
like i kind of feel that like uh you


---------114:35----------
know the more that uh i i do this um and


---------114:37----------
i i i try to invite people to like um


---------114:41----------
that it's it's you know if


---------114:42----------
i i feel like i'm trying to create a


---------114:44----------
space where that you know it's more


---------114:46----------
lighthearted than not uh


---------114:48----------
so but you know um


---------114:51----------
i think the more that uh i've gotten uh


---------114:53----------
a call that i don't know how to respond


---------114:55----------
to the better i've gotten with dealing


---------114:57----------
with with that


---------114:59----------
um


---------115:01----------
yeah like uh like i did i did i do like


---------115:04----------
live shows every once in a while i


---------115:06----------
started i've been redoing that recently


---------115:08----------
and um i always like i had this


---------115:10----------
impression that uh people who


---------115:13----------
you know uh i've started like uh the


---------115:14----------
first half i'll like take phone calls


---------115:16----------
and they're gonna bring people up from


---------115:17----------
the audience and when people come up


---------115:18----------
from the audience i have this like


---------115:20----------
expectation that uh the the subject


---------115:23----------
matter that they will want to talk about


---------115:24----------
is a little bit more lighthearted than


---------115:26----------
not and i had this guy come on at one of


---------115:28----------
the live shows who like got really like


---------115:31----------
sort of serious and deep


---------115:33----------
with me about um like his


---------115:36----------
his um


---------115:38----------
wife like recently opened up their


---------115:40----------
marriage and uh like he wasn't able to


---------115:43----------
um like


---------115:45----------
you know find other people to have sex


---------115:46----------
with but she was and that was making him


---------115:48----------
insecure and like i and and uh he was


---------115:52----------
like really going off and i was not


---------115:54----------
expecting this


---------115:55----------
whatsoever but um


---------115:57----------
weirdly i didn't


---------115:59----------
i don't know i didn't feel like nervous


---------116:01----------
or like oh [ __ ] what the [ __ ] am i gonna


---------116:02----------
do i just kind of like let him


---------116:04----------
talk


---------116:06----------
uh


---------116:07----------
and sat in that moment


---------116:10----------
um


---------116:11----------
and it and i think it ended up turning


---------116:14----------
out okay but uh


---------116:16----------
yeah i don't know i i i i


---------116:19----------
i'm trying to figure out how to deal


---------116:20----------
with stuff like that when it occurs and


---------116:22----------
i've i've found that i just sort of uh


---------116:25----------
sit in it and let them let them keep


---------116:27----------
talking if i don't have anything to say


---------116:29----------
that's typically what i do if i don't


---------116:30----------
have anything to say is i just


---------116:31----------
let them know yeah so i think that


---------116:32----------
that's


---------116:33----------
you know


---------116:34----------
sounds very


---------116:36----------
therapeutic to me


---------116:37----------
doesn't mean that it's therapy right


---------116:39----------
like but


---------116:41----------
i think you know just giving human


---------116:42----------
beings like just being human first and


---------116:44----------
foremost


---------116:46----------
is what it sounds like like that person


---------116:47----------
just needs you to be human in the gecko


---------116:50----------
costume


---------116:51----------
and then secondly you know if you really


---------116:53----------
want to know how to you know help people


---------116:55----------
and and


---------116:56----------
really want to like


---------116:58----------
you know in a sense get get better in a


---------117:00----------
particular dimension of what you do


---------117:02----------
because i think you're quite good and


---------117:03----------
you know how to get better what you do


---------117:04----------
you can also you know become a therapist


---------117:06----------
if you really feel like it right so like


---------117:08----------
you can go through those those kinds of


---------117:10----------
those kinds of trainings and really


---------117:12----------
learn


---------117:13----------
in a guided fashion i'm not recommending


---------117:15----------
it i'm just saying like that's one of


---------117:17----------
the options


---------117:18----------
sure i you know people tell me that all


---------117:20----------
the time and i always i'm like i would


---------117:21----------
never want to be a therapist in my


---------117:22----------
entire life i think that would be uh


---------117:25----------
because i don't


---------117:26----------
you know thing things like what i just


---------117:28----------
described like happen


---------117:30----------
but i i'd prefer if they stayed


---------117:33----------
you know in the ratio of like 10


---------117:35----------
or less of the uh yeah overall i i i you


---------117:38----------
know


---------117:39----------
i like being you know like uh i like i i


---------117:42----------
you know i do twitch to like you know


---------117:44----------
entertain and community and stuff not


---------117:46----------
necessarily um


---------117:48----------
i want to do like you know be be a


---------117:51----------
be a therapist


---------117:52----------
true or anything like that but uh


---------117:58----------
yeah i don't know i think that would be


---------117:59----------
that would be hard maybe too hard i


---------118:02----------
think it makes sense man i think it


---------118:03----------
sounds to me like what you enjoy doing


---------118:05----------
is being an entertainer


---------118:08----------
you like being kind of funny and


---------118:10----------
available to people but just because


---------118:11----------
you're an entertainer doesn't mean that


---------118:13----------
you can't help people


---------118:15----------
and as some people said have said in the


---------118:17----------
past laughter is the best medicine for


---------118:20----------
sure for sure


---------118:22----------
so i think sometimes you get some heavy


---------118:23----------
stuff i think that just speaks to


---------118:26----------
the atmosphere that you create in


---------118:28----------
people's comfort


---------118:30----------
in terms of coming on and being able to


---------118:32----------
share that and like knowing that i know


---------118:34----------
it sounds kind of weird but if they if i


---------118:36----------
can imagine how much courage and shame


---------118:38----------
that person must have been feeling


---------118:40----------
then they kind of came on


---------118:42----------
and also like to know that


---------118:44----------
i'm gonna go up and talk to a dude in a


---------118:47----------
gecko costume and no one is going to


---------118:49----------
laugh at me


---------118:50----------
like that's quite the achievement in


---------118:53----------
terms of the atmosphere you've created


---------118:56----------
the one one actually


---------118:59----------
probably


---------119:00----------
among the biggest problems that i have


---------119:02----------
with the stream is


---------119:05----------
i'm really is is is balancing out the


---------119:09----------
the atmosphere in a way because i i i


---------119:12----------
want to like reserve the right to like


---------119:15----------
you know [ __ ] around and like you know


---------119:17----------
not be a jerk to callers but like you


---------119:19----------
know be whatever little gecko character


---------119:21----------
you know but but also reserve like like


---------119:24----------
a very lighthearted energy but then also


---------119:26----------
like you know


---------119:27----------
reserve all the other stuff and like


---------119:29----------
really trying to find that balance has


---------119:31----------
actually been


---------119:32----------
pretty sort of difficult


---------119:35----------
i think i can imagine


---------119:37----------
so i think i think lyle i encourage you


---------119:39----------
to keep trying man because i think that


---------119:41----------
what we're seeing is that


---------119:44----------
how can i say this


---------119:48----------
i feel like the the line between


---------119:52----------
entertainment and therapy


---------119:55----------
is


---------119:56----------
narrowing so i think like like i know it


---------119:59----------
sounds kind of weird but like


---------120:01----------
therapy used to be therapy is the place


---------120:03----------
that we used to contain all of the bad


---------120:05----------
stuff in life and entertainment used to


---------120:07----------
be the way that we


---------120:10----------
like the place where we keep all the


---------120:12----------
good stuff in life


---------120:13----------
and i i don't know if you've uh seen or


---------120:15----------
heard you know inside by bo burnham


---------120:18----------
but but


---------120:20----------
i think like that's a prime example of


---------120:22----------
him like


---------120:23----------
in a very like entertaining and comedic


---------120:27----------
way like offering a lot of really


---------120:29----------
awesome


---------120:30----------
insight and even support to people who


---------120:33----------
are like really really struggling


---------120:36----------
and and so i think striking that balance


---------120:38----------
between like being a place where people


---------120:40----------
can come and laugh but also like people


---------120:42----------
can come and like


---------120:43----------
say some heavy [ __ ] and we can all kind


---------120:45----------
of laugh about it like together


---------120:47----------
like that's increasingly important


---------120:49----------
because i think it's these weird kinds


---------120:50----------
of interventions


---------120:52----------
that we really need like into mental


---------120:54----------
health arena which are not just


---------120:55----------
treatment it's sort of like you look at


---------120:57----------
physical health you know we have


---------120:58----------
nutrition we have exercise all of those


---------121:00----------
things improve cardiovascular health but


---------121:03----------
are not medicine


---------121:04----------
the problem is that it when it comes to


---------121:06----------
like mental health like we don't really


---------121:08----------
have


---------121:10----------
those well-developed societal like


---------121:12----------
support structures which i think


---------121:14----------
sometimes you'll see people like you


---------121:15----------
know comedians and stuff like that i


---------121:17----------
think dave chappelle actually does a


---------121:19----------
decent job of this too where he you know


---------121:20----------
talks about like toxicity and like


---------121:23----------
things like that sometimes we'll have


---------121:25----------
you know folks that are a little bit


---------121:26----------
more


---------121:27----------
um


---------121:27----------
[Music]


---------121:30----------
you know like i think jordan peterson's


---------121:32----------
another i know he's a divisive figure


---------121:33----------
but i think he's like a good example of


---------121:35----------
someone who's like talking about mental


---------121:37----------
health without it being treatment


---------121:40----------
and so i think you being able to strike


---------121:41----------
that balance between like heavy and


---------121:43----------
comedic is actually like really


---------121:44----------
important societally


---------121:46----------
it's what we hear a lot on twitch is


---------121:48----------
that you know a lot of streamers are


---------121:50----------
there for like mental health support for


---------121:52----------
their communities


---------121:54----------
sure because


---------121:55----------
you know there's nowhere else to get it


---------121:56----------
like we're not getting enough of


---------121:58----------
whatever that emotional nutrition is so


---------122:00----------
we got to get it from a dude in a green


---------122:01----------
gecko costume


---------122:03----------
here i guess i have this fear of like uh


---------122:06----------
you know i if if i if i ever like you


---------122:09----------
know my stream just becomes


---------122:13----------
you know heavy calls and like


---------122:16----------
i i wouldn't want to do it anymore sure


---------122:18----------
you know if it was like


---------122:20----------
just


---------122:21----------
that you know i i'd like to


---------122:24----------
i don't know it's been it's been a


---------122:25----------
really hard uh sort of sort of balance


---------122:27----------
of


---------122:28----------
those um


---------122:30----------
those things but um i i totally see what


---------122:32----------
you're saying i think uh


---------122:34----------
i think it's it's a good


---------122:36----------
yeah he wants to to learn how to strike


---------122:39----------
makes sense man


---------122:40----------
listen i gotta get going um for sure


---------122:43----------
kind of last thoughts or questions


---------122:44----------
before we wrap up


---------122:46----------
uh


---------122:47----------
no i think we're we're good thank you so


---------122:49----------
much for having me this was this was


---------122:51----------
good yeah man i really loved it so two


---------122:54----------
or three kind of final points one is i


---------122:55----------
normally teach meditation at the end of


---------122:57----------
the stream but i'm not teaching because


---------122:58----------
i'm sick


---------122:59----------
and my teachers have told me not to


---------123:01----------
instruct in meditation when i'm ill so i


---------123:03----------
apologize for that you know if you're


---------123:04----------
interested in learning something down


---------123:06----------
the road um let us know you should get


---------123:08----------
an acc access to um


---------123:11----------
dr k's guide to mental health because


---------123:12----------
you're a guest on the stream


---------123:15----------
and there's one video in particular if


---------123:16----------
you're curious about there's a video on


---------123:18----------
vidya and nyan which is sort of that


---------123:20----------
information understanding thing that we


---------123:21----------
kind of talked a little bit about


---------123:23----------
but there's also some stuff about kind


---------123:25----------
of like confidence and not sort of like


---------123:27----------
developing the flow state and stuff like


---------123:29----------
that a lot of things that we talked


---------123:30----------
about there i would check out the


---------123:32----------
meditation portion of the guide because


---------123:35----------
not as directly as we talked about it


---------123:36----------
