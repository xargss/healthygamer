---------00:00----------
the instinctual solution would be what


---------00:02----------
you have to do is find meaning in life


---------00:04----------
right like that's the standard answer


---------00:06----------
like if you're unhappy and your life has


---------00:08----------
no meaning


---------00:08----------
go and find meaning like we have this


---------00:10----------
discord thing that you can join to where


---------00:12----------
people talk about what's wrong with the


---------00:13----------
world


---------00:13----------
I think that's useful but what I want


---------00:16----------
everyone to understand is that in in


---------00:18----------
Kevin's case it's not just finding


---------00:21----------
meaning it's finding when meaning went


---------00:24----------
away because when you are nine or 10


---------00:27----------
like life hopefully has meaning like


---------00:29----------
it's just it's simple meaning but its


---------00:31----------
meaning


---------00:36----------
on you buddy yeah we're gonna do


---------00:39----------
meditation don't worry promise you guys


---------00:43----------
meditation we're going to do it but I


---------00:45----------
feel like we have to do this real quick


---------00:49----------
hey cannabis yeah can you yeah I don't


---------00:54----------
have a webcam and I'm from Denmark so


---------00:56----------
hope the that's the accent is all right


---------00:59----------
cool no problem


---------01:00----------
can you guys hear lupus


---------01:07----------
okay so lupus use you made a statement


---------01:11----------
earlier about you feel like you're


---------01:13----------
suffering is because you have a lot of


---------01:15----------
expectations I would think so like yes


---------01:20----------
what do you mean by that I think every


---------01:25----------
time I want to make a change or when I


---------01:29----------
view my life it's it's really hot


---------01:36----------
ah it's hard to formulate that's what I


---------01:40----------
take your time


---------01:46----------
so when I think of for example what what


---------01:50----------
really ignited how I feel right now is


---------01:53----------
the break-up I had with my girlfriend


---------01:57----------
and I came to a realization that I had


---------02:01----------
build up everything in my life around


---------02:05----------
being with her and nothing about being


---------02:08----------
with me so the attachment to to every


---------02:10----------
far I had in the future was based really


---------02:13----------
around being with her and not being with


---------02:17----------
my like with myself laughing yeah yeah


---------02:23----------
so I think that's that's so I think this


---------02:26----------
is gonna be a short call you're welcome


---------02:28----------
to come back on later but I think that's


---------02:30----------
the crux of it right so here's the


---------02:32----------
reason that you don't have a life worth


---------02:34----------
living is because you constructed this


---------02:36----------
castle of a life with her in your mind


---------02:40----------
and so that was the life that was worth


---------02:43----------
living


---------02:45----------
and it involved her like you built this


---------02:47----------
castle with her in mind and she was a


---------02:49----------
part of every brick each of those bricks


---------02:52----------
that you placed with her in mind is one


---------02:54----------
attachment this is where you were gonna


---------02:56----------
live this is what Monday's would be like


---------02:58----------
this is what Tuesday's would be like


---------02:59----------
this is when you would or wouldn't have


---------03:01----------
kids or you guys were gonna talk about


---------03:03----------
having kids


---------03:03----------
you're gonna visit family not visit


---------03:05----------
family everything in life involves her


---------03:07----------
that's what I'm hearing from you yeah


---------03:10----------
and the way that that I've thought about


---------03:13----------
it is like how I feel now on my


---------03:17----------
education and on my everyday life is


---------03:19----------
that I I have no desire to complete my


---------03:23----------
final education because if


---------03:28----------
be it the desire was to like go to work


---------03:32----------
and then come home to her it wasn't to


---------03:34----------
contend with work yeah so do you guys


---------03:37----------
see this do you see how like the reason


---------03:40----------
that so this isn't necessarily


---------03:41----------
depression right this is an attachment


---------03:44----------
to a fantasy and fulfillment of that


---------03:47----------
fantasy was the driving force and lupus


---------03:49----------
is life


---------03:51----------
like it was all to create this life and


---------03:55----------
now that the girlfriend is out of the


---------03:57----------
picture the life comes crumbling down


---------03:59----------
and all of your reasons for living and


---------04:03----------
suffering and trying suffering isn't the


---------04:06----------
right word for like you know doing


---------04:07----------
things that are not fun we're based on


---------04:10----------
this ideal so now lupus how old are you


---------04:13----------
what do I call you by the way okay you


---------04:16----------
can call me Kevin if it's better sure


---------04:19----------
but how I feel is that even without her


---------04:26----------
I'm still sad like I don't know how it's


---------04:29----------
really hard to formulate yeah yeah so I


---------04:34----------
think you have so I think the tricky


---------04:36----------
thing here is that you have sadness how


---------04:38----------
long ago did y'all break up it was a


---------04:42----------
one-way you go yeah we go okay


---------04:44----------
but the like the feeling of non


---------04:49----------
fulfillment or the the feeling of of


---------04:52----------
sadness and and that whole charade has


---------04:55----------
has been going on for years surroundings


---------04:59----------
a couple of traumatic events and I think


---------05:03----------
the I was I think that I was sad before


---------05:05----------
I met her but she made the like the


---------05:09----------
reasons to live better like I didn't


---------05:12----------
really have any reasons to do anything


---------05:13----------
before meeting her and then when I met


---------05:16----------
her like everything was based around


---------05:20----------
this whole fact and we've been together


---------05:22----------
for five years so so the state of being


---------05:24----------
unhappy has been really long but she has


---------05:28----------
she the whole like so not suffering you


---------05:33----------
you distinguish Beth but but being sad


---------05:35----------
worth it because I could go home to hers


---------05:37----------
exactly so I want you guys I want


---------05:39----------
everyone to and you to understand this


---------05:41----------
Kevin the sadness in hurt your


---------05:46----------
relationship with her are independent


---------05:48----------
things that's what I've been saying all


---------05:50----------
along and the problem is that your lack


---------05:52----------
of fulfillment could be numbed because


---------05:55----------
of the positivity of your relationship


---------05:57----------
with her


---------05:58----------
yeah I hate them yeah so like us only


---------06:02----------
now it's only now that I realize this


---------06:04----------
yes and so this is the big problem is


---------06:07----------
that everyone is gonna think that you're


---------06:09----------
feeling unfulfilled because you broke up


---------06:11----------
with her she broke up with you or


---------06:12----------
whatever but you have to understand that


---------06:14----------
your search for meaning predated her


---------06:17----------
yeah and that the only way to fix that


---------06:19----------
problem is to find meaning like you can


---------06:22----------
forget it


---------06:23----------
you can distract yourself with


---------06:26----------
girlfriends video games parties booze


---------06:32----------
you can distract yourself as much as you


---------06:34----------
want to but this is my whole point this


---------06:36----------
is what would they realize is that


---------06:38----------
suffering is independent from all that


---------06:40----------
other crap your search so you have kind


---------06:44----------
of different things going on right so


---------06:45----------
there's sadness because you broke up


---------06:47----------
with someone that you've been with for


---------06:48----------
five years that's like absolutely like a


---------06:51----------
psychosomatic thing there are just parts


---------06:52----------
of your physiology that are gonna make


---------06:54----------
you feel sad yeah unfortunately you're


---------06:56----------
just gonna have to feel that way for


---------06:58----------
some time there are a lot of things that


---------07:00----------
you can do that you know people kind of


---------07:01----------
like common wisdom will say like so


---------07:03----------
spending time with nature is great it


---------07:04----------
sounds like you're from Europe so it's


---------07:06----------
probably cold where you are yeah it's


---------07:08----------
freezing in Denmark yeah so if you're in


---------07:10----------
Denmark so I don't know exactly what


---------07:12----------
what people do there but you know I'd


---------07:13----------
say like you know listen to sad music


---------07:15----------
spend time with nature spend time with


---------07:17----------
animals spend time with people that care


---------07:19----------
about you all those things are important


---------07:21----------
and there are two other things to think


---------07:24----------
about


---------07:25----------
one is that some of your suffering is


---------07:28----------
going to be because of the shattered


---------07:29----------
expectations from this relationship and


---------07:32----------
one of those shattered expectations this


---------07:35----------
is a really important one is that as


---------07:37----------
long as she was in your life you didn't


---------07:39----------
have to figure out that other source of


---------07:41----------
deeper sadness that she was going to


---------07:44----------
cure you of that other deeper sadness


---------07:47----------
that's the most dangerous expectation


---------07:50----------
but now you realize that she hasn't


---------07:52----------
cured you of and that it's still there


---------07:56----------
yeah it's all it's also a realization


---------07:59----------
that that that I've had myself thinking


---------08:03----------
about the whole breakup and stuff


---------08:04----------
because I'm as you saying sad that we


---------08:07----------
broke up but now I have this other


---------08:09----------
feeling that have been gone for five


---------08:11----------
years and then predates all of this and


---------08:14----------
predates all into my teens and and stuff


---------08:18----------
like that and and I think I had I can


---------08:21----------
really distinguish between those two


---------08:24----------
elements and I know that I have to work


---------08:26----------
on the under ladder


---------08:28----------
exactly right so that's so I think it's


---------08:30----------
awesome that you recognized that these


---------08:32----------
are two fundamentally different things


---------08:33----------
and this is what like that hopefully


---------08:36----------
I've Illustrated it enough and for all


---------08:39----------
of you all of that are listening


---------08:40----------
understand that like happiness and


---------08:42----------
unhappiness and depression or like two


---------08:46----------
different things


---------08:47----------
and this is the conversation that I have


---------08:50----------
with people is that we could treat your


---------08:51----------
depression we've sort of dealt with your


---------08:53----------
depression now you're unhappy there's a


---------08:55----------
different road for that but I have a


---------08:58----------
question than the box


---------09:00----------
my sadness relating to my girlfriend I


---------09:03----------
know a sadness and and suffering to it


---------09:06----------
to a certain degree but


---------09:09----------
can i still be depressed because yes


---------09:12----------
alright because my whole life I have had


---------09:17----------
this numbness to to a desire to do


---------09:24----------
anything in my life to complete anything


---------09:27----------
meaningful even even things that really


---------09:30----------
interests me and then I want to pour


---------09:32----------
things into and it I can agree I know


---------09:35----------
the trauma that that really did that set


---------09:39----------
this off I don't know if you want to go


---------09:42----------
into like specifics or anything well my


---------09:46----------
dad got sick when I was around 12 years


---------09:48----------
old and I've known from that certain


---------09:51----------
place in my life to now that that I have


---------09:55----------
had that feeling so before it's it's


---------09:58----------
kind of candid I don't know if that's


---------09:59----------
just childhood memories and nostalgia


---------10:01----------
stuff but but I know that was the


---------10:04----------
trigger and then certain traumas after


---------10:08----------
that so okay


---------10:11----------
keep going so so can this like


---------10:16----------
I have never went to a psychiatrist or


---------10:18----------
psychologist or anything about this


---------10:20----------
sadness I only went last year and I


---------10:22----------
didn't follow up on it because I was too


---------10:24----------
scared to talk about my feelings right


---------10:27----------
but now chat right yeah you don't you


---------10:31----------
can't see my face but but now I've


---------10:37----------
reached out to a doctor and and I get


---------10:39----------
like I feel I haven't reached out


---------10:43----------
because my girlfriend broke up with me


---------10:45----------
but I've I've reached out because now I


---------10:47----------
can really feel the suffering of not


---------10:51----------
living like I know I have I I just wink


---------10:54----------
I distinguish my thoughts between my


---------10:57----------
feelings and and logic and I know it's


---------10:59----------
for example I know it's not good to kill


---------11:00----------
yourself I know it's it's hurting it


---------11:02----------
would hurt everyone around you and stuff


---------11:03----------
like that but my feelings say that that


---------11:06----------
I don't want to live I don't have a


---------11:08----------
desire to live yeah and this I have


---------11:12----------
certainly that you have to discover


---------11:13----------
right so this is where like most people


---------11:16----------
think and this could be true I don't


---------11:18----------
know that a desire to live is something


---------11:21----------
that people just stumble upon


---------11:23----------
there's this huge assumption that like


---------11:25----------
the default state is to have a desire to


---------11:28----------
live and have like goals and passions


---------11:33----------
and motivations and my experience it


---------11:35----------
doesn't [ __ ] work like that a desire


---------11:38----------
to live a reason to live is is something


---------11:40----------
that is gained through effort and sweat


---------11:42----------
and hard work exploration pain and


---------11:46----------
reflection


---------11:48----------
yeah so how old are you Kevin


---------11:52----------
twit 26 okay so at your age I was doing


---------11:57----------
absolutely nothing


---------11:59----------
like not a damn thing I did from from


---------12:03----------
college with a shitty GPA didn't have a


---------12:06----------
job actually I did have a job maybe


---------12:09----------
actually 26 maybe I was doing something


---------12:10----------
I took that back


---------12:11----------
maybe but I mean I think you know you


---------12:18----------
have to do some soul-searching


---------12:20----------
anyways yeah but that I mean your life


---------12:24----------
lacks meaning which is the problem but


---------12:28----------
also that like meaning is not something


---------12:29----------
that you stumble upon and in your case I


---------12:32----------
think part of what's going on is like


---------12:34----------
this trauma that you said I think is


---------12:35----------
very significant now this is the other


---------12:37----------
problem as people confuse like trauma


---------12:38----------
with depression because both of them


---------12:40----------
make you feel like not doing anything


---------12:42----------
but I think the origins of these two


---------12:44----------
things are very different


---------12:46----------
so if your root problem is that you


---------12:49----------
started to feel like life was


---------12:50----------
meaningless because your dad got sick


---------12:52----------
when you were 12 that's where the the


---------12:55----------
work needs to be done yeah and and I


---------12:58----------
think unresolved traumas can you call


---------13:00----------
that a trauma like sharable dying and


---------13:02----------
yeah okay because there are several of


---------13:06----------
those that that I can like clear that


---------13:08----------
adjusting how did you when you what do


---------13:11----------
you remember about when your dad got


---------13:12----------
sick and you're 12 how did you feel oh


---------13:14----------
that that it's really rough and I laugh


---------13:18----------
when I'm when I'm like nervous so yep


---------13:21----------
yeah


---------13:27----------
I I actually began when he was in the


---------13:31----------
hospital I am I'm I was being kind of a


---------13:34----------
stand-up comedian because


---------13:37----------
I wanted everybody to laugh and I yeah I


---------13:41----------
felt really sad I don't know even know


---------13:44----------
if that's the word because he worked so


---------13:47----------
much before that I didn't even knew him


---------13:49----------
and then he was home all the time and


---------13:51----------
and and the I think the the change in


---------13:55----------
our life that that he had had to be home


---------13:59----------
and and change he had to do mentally


---------14:02----------
like he became another person a


---------14:04----------
chronically ill person that


---------14:09----------
I know I was specifically talking about


---------14:12----------
my feelings towards that the trauma or


---------14:18----------
I'm getting confused sir yeah I think


---------14:20----------
you're doing great how did it feel to


---------14:23----------
see him transform


---------14:29----------
there was really devastating I think


---------14:33----------
would be the right word and then what


---------14:36----------
did it even remote in you it broke


---------14:38----------
something


---------14:40----------
yeah it broke like reality that did the


---------14:45----------
thought that your parents are model and


---------14:48----------
I certainly had to take on a much larger


---------14:54----------
responsibility at all I think the


---------14:57----------
challenge here Kevin I'm gonna just take


---------15:00----------
a shot in the dark because we're gonna


---------15:01----------
have to transition soon all right so I'm


---------15:04----------
sorry no no no I mean I invited you on


---------15:07----------
and I'm really glad you came on I'm


---------15:09----------
gonna apologize to you because I think


---------15:11----------
the challenge here is that the feeling


---------15:14----------
get created in you is not something that


---------15:16----------
a 12 year old knows how to put words to


---------15:19----------
yeah and I still can't put worse


---------15:23----------
- I'm gonna I'm gonna try I think that


---------15:25----------
I'm feeling it created for 12 year old


---------15:27----------
you as what's the [ __ ] point if he


---------15:30----------
can work so hard and this can happen to


---------15:32----------
him and you can build so much in life


---------15:35----------
and then you get to turn into this like


---------15:37----------
what's the [ __ ] point


---------15:40----------
yeah


---------15:45----------
yeah like I've really struggled with


---------15:47----------
like what's it called and when you don't


---------15:50----------
care about the outcomes of things it's


---------15:52----------
it's like a philosophy yeah yeah that


---------15:57----------
everything is meaningless it's not a


---------15:58----------
stoic stoic yeah nihilism I have really


---------16:01----------
struggled with that because one other


---------16:04----------
time when I was feeling really down I I


---------16:05----------
really had the thought that everything


---------16:07----------
was just meaning this yes so this is


---------16:10----------
something you've gotta really understand


---------16:11----------
Kevin is like for you for other people


---------16:14----------
it's a philosophy for you it's a reality


---------16:16----------
because you saw it happened to you you


---------16:19----------
saw it happen to your dad you saw the


---------16:21----------
futility of life get shown to you in the


---------16:24----------
way that your dad's life crumbled apart


---------16:29----------
right so for other people it's something


---------16:31----------
that they read about in a philosophy


---------16:33----------
class for you you saw that when you were


---------16:35----------
12 and it left its [ __ ] mark and now


---------16:40----------
when you say like I have no reason to


---------16:42----------
live yeah because you don't understand


---------16:44----------
what the point is because you are like


---------16:46----------
what's the [ __ ] point if you can just


---------16:48----------
get destroyed and if this is like if you


---------16:51----------
can work so hard you can build a life


---------16:52----------
you can have children you can have


---------16:54----------
family you can have a career


---------16:55----------
sounds like you worked a lot and then


---------16:58----------
you can get sick and it all just goes to


---------17:00----------
[ __ ] like why bother like I don't think


---------17:02----------
you're suicidal which I know you've said


---------17:04----------
you aren't which I'm grateful for I I


---------17:06----------
think your problem is like what's the


---------17:08----------
point


---------17:08----------
yeah and so that feeling was a has its


---------17:15----------
origins in a lesson that you learned by


---------17:17----------
watching your father get sick


---------17:21----------
and until you unlearn that lesson


---------17:24----------
you're going to continue to feel this


---------17:25----------
way


---------17:28----------
good news is that it can be unlocked


---------17:32----------
and that you can find me it's just 12


---------17:37----------
year old you didn't understand what was


---------17:40----------
going on and the problem is that when


---------17:43----------
we're young the stuff that forms in our


---------17:45----------
mind stays there but doesn't like grow


---------17:47----------
with us


---------17:50----------
and someone was asking is this a some


---------17:51----------
scar absolutely this is the definition


---------17:53----------
of a some scar


---------17:55----------
okay can you briefly say what that is no


---------18:00----------
okay so I think I talked about some


---------18:03----------
scars on a prior stream hopefully


---------18:05----------
there's a there's a so I'll explain it


---------18:07----------
very briefly so a some scar is a ball of


---------18:10----------
undigested emotion that sort of


---------18:12----------
continues to exert an influence on your


---------18:15----------
mind all right all right that makes


---------18:18----------
sense yeah so uh the the example that I


---------18:20----------
use is like if I'm walking down the


---------18:21----------
street let's say that uh you you ever


---------18:26----------
hang out with kids Kevin yeah I need uh


---------18:28----------
nieces are never anything yeah I had a


---------18:31----------
nice and when I was with my yeah so so


---------18:35----------
when you how old is your niece nine okay


---------18:39----------
so you did you hang out with your niece


---------18:42----------
when she was like six yeah okay I got to


---------18:45----------
know whether fooled five years okay


---------18:47----------
great so when you went imagine that your


---------18:50----------
your niece is six years old and you're


---------18:51----------
walking down the street and she sees a


---------18:54----------
dog and she gets excited because she


---------18:57----------
likes dogs and she pets the dog and the


---------18:58----------
dog bites her what happens in her mind


---------19:02----------
what does she feel uh she would feel


---------19:06----------
scared of the dark absolutely right


---------19:08----------
she's terrified so thankfully let's say


---------19:10----------
that the dog didn't really hurt her or


---------19:11----------
anything like that she doesn't need


---------19:12----------
medical attention and then yeah she's


---------19:14----------
your niece so you have presumably


---------19:16----------
brothers or sisters who are her parents


---------19:20----------
yeah it was among my girls girl friend


---------19:23----------
sites oh yeah okay curses yeah okay so


---------19:26----------
um you know let's say that you're


---------19:28----------
babysitting the niece and then the the


---------19:30----------
niece is crying and so you're kind of


---------19:32----------
thinking like okay how am I gonna calm


---------19:34----------
this child down and then you walk into a


---------19:36----------
toy store and then you get her like ten


---------19:39----------
minutes later she's got a toy in her


---------19:40----------
hands and what do you think she's


---------19:41----------
feeling then


---------19:46----------
joy absolutely right yeah yeah what


---------19:50----------
happened what happened to the scared


---------19:51----------
what happened to the fear where'd it go


---------19:53----------
is it gone mm-hmm no it's still there


---------19:58----------
but but now she has something else to be


---------20:01----------
joyous about okay and what so let's say


---------20:04----------
so how does the how does the fear come


---------20:07----------
back in her what can bring it back up


---------20:11----------
like the when she sees a dog absolutely


---------20:16----------
yeah right yeah and every time she sees


---------20:20----------
a dog that fear is gonna return yeah


---------20:23----------
now let's say you're walking down the


---------20:26----------
street


---------20:28----------
and you see a dog and you reach out to


---------20:31----------
pet it and it bites you what's the first


---------20:33----------
thing that happens in your mind


---------20:39----------
I wouldn't get scared but yes you would


---------20:45----------
yes yes scared of more pain yeah in the


---------20:48----------
first instant you would have the same


---------20:50----------
reaction is your five-year-old niece


---------20:52----------
yeah right yeah then what happens in


---------20:57----------
your mind


---------21:01----------
yeah I would be able to distinguish and


---------21:05----------
get over there I think I know what


---------21:08----------
you're getting at what am I getting at


---------21:10----------
that the like my niece that emotion


---------21:14----------
would stay with her for a long time but


---------21:16----------
as an adult you would be able to


---------21:18----------
distinguish between having to be scared


---------21:20----------
of a dark because one beat you and then


---------21:23----------
approaching another one without being


---------21:25----------
scared yes in the big difference is that


---------21:28----------
your mind does some processing of that


---------21:31----------
emotion live processing it just doesn't


---------21:35----------
get buried by distraction you actually


---------21:37----------
think through how you feel and you


---------21:40----------
process it does that make sense it makes


---------21:43----------
a lot of sense like so my childhood self


---------21:46----------
was like bit by this trauma absolutely


---------21:50----------
and and like now if it happened in in my


---------21:52----------
later years I would be able to process


---------21:54----------
it process it in the whole other way so


---------21:56----------
that it wouldn't affect my everyday life


---------21:58----------
is that actually Absa right so if if you


---------22:02----------
had found meaning in your life and your


---------22:04----------
dad passed away and got sick now you


---------22:06----------
would still be sad you would still be


---------22:08----------
grief grieved you would still be


---------22:10----------
devastated but you would be able to


---------22:13----------
process it and some people don't and


---------22:15----------
some people do right because some people


---------22:17----------
like you know in their 20s something bad


---------22:19----------
happens to them and they're not able to


---------22:20----------
recover so now that the big the big


---------22:23----------
problem the big difference between you


---------22:25----------
and your niece is that you have the


---------22:27----------
capacity to process now the 12 year old


---------22:29----------
year old you did not yeah and so the


---------22:34----------
good news is you can go back in time and


---------22:37----------
you can sort of talk to your 12 year old


---------22:39----------
self


---------22:41----------
right with the help of a therapist or


---------22:43----------
someone like that because that makes it


---------22:44----------
way it easier and with the help of


---------22:46----------
annotation you can go back and explore


---------22:49----------
those feelings and you can digest them


---------22:52----------
yeah because now they right at this


---------22:55----------
moment they feel numb like I have a hard


---------22:57----------
time yes


---------22:59----------
matching bag and feeding anything yeah


---------23:02----------
do you play RPGs


---------23:03----------
yeah which RPGs


---------23:06----------
I've played World of Warcraft okay so


---------23:09----------
majority don't have an inventory right


---------23:11----------
yeah problem here is that you picked up


---------23:14----------
a lot of crap like level five like


---------23:16----------
swords and [ __ ] yeah you were 12 and


---------23:19----------
it's sitting in your inventory and it's


---------23:20----------
clogging up your inventory you never get


---------23:22----------
rid of it you got to get rid of it it's


---------23:24----------
just sitting back there and it's like


---------23:26----------
buried so far in your inventory that you


---------23:28----------
can't even access it and it like every


---------23:32----------
time you open your inventory it's there


---------23:33----------
and it's just [ __ ] taking up space


---------23:36----------
and like you can't let but like so it's


---------23:39----------
like it's interfering with things but


---------23:40----------
you don't it's just there it's just like


---------23:42----------
you know and so you've got it you've got


---------23:45----------
to process it you've got to go back and


---------23:48----------
and so this is the tricky thing is like


---------23:51----------
the instinctual solution would be what


---------23:54----------
you have to do is find meaning in life


---------23:56----------
right like that's the standard answer


---------23:58----------
like if you're unhappy and your life has


---------23:59----------
no meaning


---------24:00----------
go and find meaning like we have this


---------24:02----------
discord thing that you can join to where


---------24:04----------
people talk about what's wrong with the


---------24:05----------
world


---------24:05----------
I think that's useful but what I want


---------24:08----------
everyone to understand is that in in


---------24:10----------
Kevin's case it's not just finding


---------24:12----------
meaning it's finding when meaning went


---------24:16----------
away


---------24:17----------
because when you were nine or ten like


---------24:19----------
life hopefully has meaning like it's


---------24:21----------
just it's simple meaning but its meaning


---------24:23----------
I can read I can just I can like yeah


---------24:27----------
clearly remember which person I was


---------24:29----------
before this incident and and which


---------24:30----------
person I became after the incident yeah


---------24:33----------
there you go


---------24:34----------
so you gotta go back and find that


---------24:36----------
person right yeah there's a guy in chat


---------24:39----------
saying vendor in your trauma


---------24:41----------
abso-fucking-lutely that's what you need


---------24:43----------
to do yeah right you got a vendor you


---------24:47----------
can't just like it's just hanging out


---------24:48----------
it's been hanging out there and then the


---------24:50----------
problem is you you you've had that [ __ ]


---------24:52----------
in your backpack for 14 years so you


---------24:54----------
think that your backpack


---------24:56----------
is like has like thirty less spaces


---------24:59----------
available like you don't even realize


---------25:02----------
it's become so normal for you that you


---------25:04----------
don't even realize that that's just like


---------25:05----------
you don't realize that you've got 30


---------25:07----------
backpack slots that are just taking out


---------25:09----------
my crap because you've had it since the


---------25:11----------
beginning like as long as you can


---------25:12----------
remember that makes really a lot of


---------25:15----------
sense yeah it really does I really feel


---------25:18----------
like like after the incident like


---------25:21----------
everything from being able to do well in


---------25:25----------
school and and like everything yeah the


---------25:29----------
motivation and the desire to do anything


---------25:32----------
like it really felt like I only have


---------25:35----------
like a third of the motivation the third


---------25:38----------
of everything else the third of the


---------25:39----------
desire to get up in the morning and yeah


---------25:42----------
yeah so it looks like two-thirds of your


---------25:44----------
backpack is full and that [ __ ] is just


---------25:46----------
swimming around in your unconscious mind


---------25:48----------
and your


---------25:49----------
I literally like like so this is


---------25:51----------
something that I want everyone to


---------25:52----------
understand about the mind one of the


---------25:55----------
Swami's I was studying with once told me


---------25:57----------
that any task that's unfinished like


---------26:00----------
occupies a bit of RAM in your processor


---------26:03----------
and trauma to in your case I think the


---------26:06----------
problem is that two-thirds of your RAM


---------26:07----------
is being occupied by whatever this is


---------26:11----------
by what sorry but I like this trauma or


---------26:14----------
whatever like two-thirds of your


---------26:16----------
operating power is just like clogged up


---------26:20----------
yeah and and so the cool thing is that


---------26:23----------
like like we can talk about finding


---------26:25----------
meaning and finding Dharma and all that


---------26:26----------
good stuff you can watch some of the


---------26:28----------
previous streams about that or what


---------26:30----------
check out our youtube if you don't know


---------26:31----------
what I'm talking about yeah but at the


---------26:34----------
end of the day in your case I think it's


---------26:35----------
about cleaning house right I think it's


---------26:37----------
about understanding that at some point


---------26:38----------
in life you lost your sense of meaning


---------26:41----------
and life became fundamentally like life


---------26:45----------
became so this is what happened to you


---------26:46----------
when you were 12 years old life became a


---------26:48----------
game not worth playing yeah it's just


---------26:52----------
not worth it to play anymore and so now


---------26:55----------
you find yourself at 26 and you're like


---------26:56----------
why can't I play this game I think this


---------26:58----------
game is [ __ ] stupid and I'm saying


---------27:00----------
yeah you do because you learned that


---------27:02----------
when you were 12 it became a stupid game


---------27:04----------
now but you got to go back


---------27:08----------
Yeah right and you've got to find out


---------27:11----------
like what happened like why did I stink


---------27:14----------
this game Oh the reason the game [ __ ]


---------27:16----------
sucks is because my controller got


---------27:17----------
unplugged


---------27:19----------
and so I just respawn and I get like


---------27:21----------
camped by these [ __ ] and I can't


---------27:23----------
shoot and I can't move


---------27:26----------
or I can use Waze to like move around


---------27:28----------
but I can't use my mouse select point


---------27:30----------
anything now we're playing an FPS by the


---------27:32----------
way yeah and then it's sure you can you


---------27:36----------
can in theory you can play FPS with just


---------27:38----------
a keyboard in theory but boy is that


---------27:40----------
gonna be a shitty game to play you feel


---------27:42----------
really crippled yeah and how do you feel


---------27:45----------
Kevin crippled yeah absolutely yeah so


---------27:50----------
Plus Mouse back in a name


---------27:55----------

---------27:58----------
okay we're gonna do some meditation like


---------28:02----------

---------28:04----------

---------28:05----------

---------28:08----------

---------28:09----------

---------28:18----------

---------28:21----------

---------28:22----------

---------28:28----------

---------28:44----------
thanks a lot Kevin thank you yeah bye


---------28:50----------
okay


---------28:55----------
so


---------28:57----------
yeah so I think I think you know Kevin


---------28:59----------
was struggling for the words I think


---------29:00----------
crippled is a good word alright so let's


---------29:03----------
do let's do meditation now the question


---------29:08----------
is what kind of meditation are we going


---------29:10----------
to do to


---------29:13----------
given the situation today about trauma


---------29:16----------
meaning
