---------00:00----------
let's start with disclaimers so very


---------00:02----------
important today so


---------00:04----------
just a reminder that everything we


---------00:05----------
discussed today on stream is intended to


---------00:07----------
be for educational purposes only nothing


---------00:09----------
is intended to be taken as medical


---------00:10----------
advice if you all have a medical concern


---------00:13----------
please go see a licensed professional


---------00:15----------
and seek their individual advice and


---------00:17----------
this is doubly important today because


---------00:19----------
what what i'm going to do today is give


---------00:20----------
you guys


---------00:21----------
essentially like my sex ed talk this is


---------00:24----------
a like it's something that i talk about


---------00:25----------
with patients a lot


---------00:27----------
so i essentially have like a spiel that


---------00:31----------
when someone comes to my office and has


---------00:33----------
concerns or is curious about


---------00:35----------
uh sexual education like these are the


---------00:37----------
things that i'll explain to them


---------00:39----------
um for those of y'all so like it'll be


---------00:41----------
like these tend to be


---------00:43----------
patients that are like teenagers or


---------00:45----------
young adults who may not have like


---------00:47----------
ever had someone sit down and talk to


---------00:49----------
them about sex


---------00:51----------
and like what's normal what's not normal


---------00:53----------
um you know what's healthy what's


---------00:55----------
unhealthy like things to watch out for


---------00:57----------
things to be careful about so it's not


---------00:59----------
gonna be i know we're doing this on


---------01:01----------
twitch and i know that


---------01:03----------
oftentimes people will meme about stuff


---------01:05----------
they're gonna be a couple of jokes right


---------01:07----------
because that's just how i teach


---------01:08----------
but like i just want to emphasize that


---------01:11----------
really the the goal of of today's


---------01:13----------
lecture is to just educate people


---------01:16----------
and i strongly strongly encourage all to


---------01:18----------
go actually see a licensed professional


---------01:21----------
if anything that we discuss today seems


---------01:23----------
to resonate with you


---------01:24----------
um and it's it's not going to be like


---------01:27----------
you know like this is how you have sex


---------01:29----------
it's not like a how-to guide for sexual


---------01:32----------
intercourse


---------01:33----------
what it's really what we're going to be


---------01:34----------
talking about today is is really more


---------01:36----------
medical in nature it's like helping


---------01:37----------
people understand like what's normal


---------01:39----------
what's not normal what should y'all be


---------01:41----------
watching out for


---------01:43----------
um


---------01:44----------
it's kind of like this is what i'd say


---------01:45----------
you know so like sometimes parents will


---------01:47----------
ask their kids this question


---------01:49----------
so i'll give you guys an example of why


---------01:51----------
i give this talk okay


---------01:52----------
so parents will ask kids their question


---------01:55----------
you know are you having sex and the kid


---------01:57----------
will like if they have a good


---------01:58----------
relationship the kid will say yes


---------02:00----------
and then the parent will be like are you


---------02:02----------
being safe


---------02:04----------
and then the kid will be like yes


---------02:07----------
and then that's the end of the


---------02:08----------
discussion right it's like there's never


---------02:11----------
like the parent doesn't want to talk


---------02:12----------
about it the kid doesn't want to talk


---------02:13----------
about it it's super awkward and it's


---------02:15----------
like what is the parent what is the kid


---------02:16----------
going to say in that situation no


---------02:19----------
like


---------02:20----------
even if they know they're not being safe


---------02:22----------
they're probably not going to say that


---------02:23----------
to begin with


---------02:24----------
and secondly like they may not have the


---------02:26----------
same idea of like what safe is


---------02:29----------
right so we're going to talk about like


---------02:31----------
what safe is like what are the


---------02:33----------
components of safe


---------02:35----------
um so another reason that we're going to


---------02:37----------
be talking about this today is because


---------02:39----------
you know as we've


---------02:41----------
not recently discovered but as we've


---------02:42----------
known for a while


---------02:44----------
you know our content people watch this


---------02:46----------
stream from 65 countries or 70 countries


---------02:50----------
and a lot of these places don't have uh


---------02:53----------
you know very robust systems of sexual


---------02:55----------
education so we're going to try to you


---------02:57----------
know teach the basics of like sexual


---------03:00----------
health today


---------03:01----------
um and so i i you know by all means have


---------03:04----------
a good time because i think that like


---------03:06----------
education shouldn't necessarily be like


---------03:08----------
no laughing aloud you know but at the


---------03:09----------
same time like let's remember that the


---------03:11----------
reason we're here is not to look penis


---------03:15----------
like that's not what we're here for


---------03:16----------
right we're here to actually or at least


---------03:18----------
that's not why i'm here


---------03:20----------
what the reason i'm here is because it's


---------03:22----------
been my observation that like a lot of


---------03:24----------
times these


---------03:26----------
these conversations are actually really


---------03:27----------
important and we don't have them enough


---------03:30----------
um you guys can clip that that's fine


---------03:33----------
it's gonna be the first of many like


---------03:34----------
don't don't sweat it dude


---------03:36----------
okay so like let's just try to be


---------03:38----------
respectful of the topic at hand do we


---------03:40----------
wanna laugh like absolutely am i gonna


---------03:42----------
make jokes like hopefully right that's


---------03:44----------
just how i teach and like i think that's


---------03:45----------
important and at the same time let's


---------03:48----------
let's try to like make sure that things


---------03:49----------
first of all don't get too far and let's


---------03:51----------
remember that the goal that we're really


---------03:52----------
here is to like try to learn something


---------03:54----------
so that we can live like happier


---------03:56----------
healthier lives okay


---------03:58----------
so a couple of quick announcements we're


---------04:00----------
launching parent coaching in one day


---------04:02----------
so we still have some spots available um


---------04:06----------
so we only have a uh you know 100 spots


---------04:09----------
in parent coaching total and so if you


---------04:11----------
guys are interested you can sign up


---------04:12----------
there so let's launch into our lecture


---------04:16----------
so today chat i want to talk to y'all


---------04:18----------
about


---------04:19----------
uh


---------04:20----------
sex ed basically so sexual health so the


---------04:23----------
way that we're going to talk about this


---------04:25----------
is it's going to be first of all like


---------04:26----------
this is going to be primarily like a


---------04:28----------
medical education lecture so it's like


---------04:30----------
something that i talk to my patients


---------04:32----------
about


---------04:33----------
um it isn't actually like medical advice


---------04:35----------
so you guys should go talk to your


---------04:37----------
doctor about things here that seem


---------04:39----------
important to you


---------04:41----------
um so we're gonna talk a little bit


---------04:43----------
about like sexual anxiety and what i


---------04:45----------
mean by that


---------04:46----------
is


---------04:47----------
like a lot of people are worried about


---------04:50----------
something related to sex


---------04:52----------
and so i think one of the biggest


---------04:53----------
uh antidotes to sexual anxiety is


---------04:56----------
actually education it's one of the few


---------04:58----------
instances in psychiatry where i think


---------05:00----------
education actually deals


---------05:03----------
like a lot of good so like you can get a


---------05:04----------
lot of benefit just by like educating


---------05:06----------
people


---------05:08----------
so in other areas of mental illness


---------05:10----------
telling depressed people or anxious


---------05:12----------
people to be less depressed or less


---------05:14----------
anxious or just let me explain to you


---------05:15----------
that there are other fish in the sea you


---------05:16----------
won't be alone for the rest of your life


---------05:18----------
here the statistics doesn't seem to make


---------05:20----------
a dent thankfully when it comes to


---------05:22----------
issues of sexuality the amount of


---------05:25----------
knowledge or understanding is so low in


---------05:27----------
general


---------05:28----------
that education seems to help people an


---------05:31----------
immense amount so what i'd like to do


---------05:33----------
today is is to share with you guys some


---------05:35----------
basic information about like normal


---------05:37----------
sexuality so like you know basics of


---------05:39----------
like puberty and things like that basics


---------05:42----------
of like menstruation and and like uh


---------05:45----------
hormonal cycles so i think this is


---------05:47----------
something that not just women but like


---------05:49----------
men should understand too like we should


---------05:51----------
understand you know for those of us that


---------05:53----------
are in relationships with women


---------05:55----------
like you know what's going on with them


---------05:57----------
like we don't have to like it's not like


---------05:59----------
some foreign mystical thing right like


---------06:01----------
as a man you can understand what's going


---------06:02----------
on with a menstrual like with a


---------06:04----------
menstrual cycle like it's just biology


---------06:06----------
it's physiology and so i think like


---------06:08----------
equipping people with like that really


---------06:10----------
basic information seems to help a lot so


---------06:12----------
some of this is gonna start a little bit


---------06:14----------
with normal sexuality


---------06:16----------
then um we're gonna move on a little bit


---------06:18----------
to safe sex so like what are the


---------06:20----------
different dimensions of safe sex


---------06:23----------
um and then we're going to touch on some


---------06:25----------
other like you know problems that people


---------06:27----------
may have and we'll review different


---------06:28----------
kinds of like birth control um you know


---------06:31----------
different kinds of stis and like why we


---------06:33----------
use certain things when we have sex


---------06:36----------
uh it's not going to be like a how-to


---------06:38----------
guide in terms of like sexual


---------06:40----------
performance or things like that


---------06:42----------
we're not going to go into a whole lot


---------06:44----------
of statistics or details about you know


---------06:46----------
like erogenous zones or what percentage


---------06:49----------
of women are able to have like organism


---------06:51----------
through vaginal intercourse and like all


---------06:52----------
this kind of stuff um there's a lot more


---------06:54----------
that we could teach but this is going to


---------06:56----------
be the basics by the way did you guys


---------06:57----------
know that uh about 70 of women can have


---------07:00----------
an orgasm through vaginal intercourse


---------07:02----------
penetrative intercourse


---------07:04----------
um so there's a lot of stuff there that


---------07:06----------
like you know we haven't there's more


---------07:08----------
detail but like this is basically like


---------07:10----------
when i get an 18 year old kid in my


---------07:12----------
office or 17 year old kid


---------07:14----------
and like this is the sort of the the


---------07:16----------
essence of what i try to teach them


---------07:18----------
about birth control safe sex and things


---------07:20----------
like that


---------07:21----------
so basically when you know when parents


---------07:23----------
ask their kids are you having safe sex


---------07:25----------
and the kid says yes and they don't talk


---------07:27----------
about like what that actually means


---------07:29----------
we're gonna try to address that


---------07:31----------
so the first thing that i kind of


---------07:32----------
mentioned is that you know this is um


---------07:35----------
uh


---------07:36----------
you know the goal of this is to be


---------07:38----------
educational because i found that


---------07:39----------
education actually does help a lot


---------07:42----------
so


---------07:43----------
um i'm going to tell you all the story


---------07:45----------
so i one time had a kid and they've


---------07:47----------
given me permission to share this story


---------07:48----------
because they shall remain anonymous


---------07:51----------
but i had a kid come into my office and


---------07:53----------
um you know we were talking they came in


---------07:55----------
for other reasons and so as you get to


---------07:57----------
know people


---------07:58----------
you know they start to open up to you


---------07:59----------
about other things and then they had


---------08:01----------
some anxiety about you know their their


---------08:03----------
sex like stuff related to sex and in


---------08:05----------
particular masturbation


---------08:07----------
so they were like you know i'm afraid


---------08:09----------
that i'm not going to like be effective


---------08:11----------
at having sex


---------08:13----------
and then i ask them well what are you


---------08:14----------
afraid of and they're like well whenever


---------08:16----------
i like masturbate i only reach the first


---------08:18----------
stage of orgasm


---------08:20----------
and i was kind of confused and i was


---------08:21----------
like what exactly do you like what is


---------08:23----------
the first stage of orgasm like help i


---------08:26----------
was confused by the phrase


---------08:29----------
and so then you know they're like well i


---------08:30----------
can only get to like the first part and


---------08:32----------
i'm like what what do you mean the first


---------08:33----------
part and he's like well like so i was


---------08:35----------
like tell me what happens


---------08:36----------
and then he's like well i reached like


---------08:38----------
the first stage and then you know like


---------08:40----------
my erection goes away and like even if i


---------08:42----------
try it starts to become painful and i


---------08:44----------
can never get to the stage stage two of


---------08:46----------
orgasm and so i kind of talk to him and


---------08:48----------
it seems like so first of all he's able


---------08:50----------
to get an erection he's able to


---------08:51----------
masturbate he's able to


---------08:53----------
um reach as he calls it the first stage


---------08:55----------
of orgasm that after the first stage of


---------08:57----------
orgasm


---------08:58----------
um you know his his penis becomes


---------09:00----------
flaccid and he like it becomes


---------09:02----------
uncomfortable for him to continue to


---------09:03----------
masturbate


---------09:04----------
so he was kind of thinking that he had


---------09:06----------
maybe screwed something up or he's been


---------09:08----------
masturbating this way for a while and


---------09:09----------
like he can't ever reach the second


---------09:10----------
stage forecast


---------09:12----------
and i was like well what what is that


---------09:13----------
what is like the second stage of orgasm


---------09:16----------
this is like professionally i'm like


---------09:18----------
what the [ __ ] you know like i


---------09:20----------
you know i wasn't actually laughing then


---------09:22----------
but i was just really like confused in


---------09:24----------
retrospect we actually both laugh about


---------09:26----------
it now


---------09:28----------
but so then he was kind of explaining to


---------09:30----------
me that like you know when he watches


---------09:31----------
pornography and like people haven't


---------09:33----------
orgasm there's like gallons of ejaculate


---------09:35----------
going everywhere but when he reaches the


---------09:37----------
first stage of orgasm he has like a


---------09:39----------
small volume of ejaculate and he can't


---------09:41----------
ever get to the you know like the fire


---------09:43----------
hydrant stage of of that he sees in in


---------09:46----------
pornography


---------09:48----------
and so like you know it took a little


---------09:49----------
while for me to realize that like you


---------09:51----------
know his expectations of what's normal


---------09:54----------
are shaped by pornography and that's not


---------09:56----------
really normal right


---------09:58----------
and so i i tried to i mean i'm still not


---------10:00----------
entirely sure to this day i mean maybe


---------10:02----------
he's a different kind of kid and there


---------10:03----------
are stages of orgasm but


---------10:05----------
what i understood from that is that he's


---------10:07----------
actually like achieving orgasm it's just


---------10:10----------
that's just a regular orgasm and it


---------10:12----------
doesn't last for like eight minutes


---------10:14----------
right because like that's the the


---------10:16----------
perception that they have for from


---------10:17----------
pornography


---------10:19----------
um and also like you know they use a lot


---------10:21----------
of like viagra and other kinds of things


---------10:24----------
when when they film pornography and


---------10:25----------
stuff so you just had very very


---------10:27----------
um unrealistic expectations of what like


---------10:30----------
a regular sexual experience was like


---------10:33----------
and you can't really blame the kid


---------10:35----------
because i think a lot of us


---------10:37----------
will have unrealistic expectations


---------10:39----------
because we do learn from things like


---------10:41----------
pornography it's not like we're you know


---------10:44----------
most schools don't really have super


---------10:46----------
robust sexual education classes um some


---------10:49----------
countries actually actively you know try


---------10:51----------
to not teach that stuff parents have


---------10:54----------
difficulty sort of having those


---------10:56----------
conversations and so like where else is


---------10:58----------
the kid supposed to learn like is it


---------10:59----------
kind of funny sure


---------11:01----------
i mean i get it i thought it would i


---------11:02----------
mean retrospect i think it's hilarious


---------11:04----------
but it's also like it's not really like


---------11:05----------
the kid's fault right it's a consequence


---------11:08----------
of the society that we we grow up in and


---------11:10----------
the way that we're educated so today


---------11:12----------
what i'd like to do is share with you


---------11:14----------
all you know some basic stuff about like


---------11:16----------
sex and sexuality


---------11:18----------
so the first thing is let's just talk


---------11:20----------
very briefly about like normal sexual


---------11:22----------
development um so you know sometime


---------11:25----------
between generally speaking like around


---------11:27----------
12 or 13 years old


---------11:29----------
most human beings will enter into a


---------11:31----------
stage called puberty which is like the


---------11:34----------
stage of sexual maturation


---------11:37----------
uh so we'll see like different kinds of


---------11:38----------
primary and secondary characteristics


---------11:41----------
for men will see things like um you know


---------11:44----------
you'll get you'll start to get erections


---------11:46----------
uh you may have some growth of your


---------11:48----------
scrotum you'll get the development of


---------11:50----------
body hair


---------11:52----------
in different places like your pubic


---------11:53----------
regions arm armpits face things like


---------11:56----------
that you'll get a deepening of the voice


---------11:58----------
there's often times a period where like


---------11:59----------
you know kids will boys will have like a


---------12:02----------
voice that cracks


---------12:03----------
um


---------12:04----------
you'll see a lot of acne as well and


---------12:06----------
that's als that's primarily driven by


---------12:08----------
like hormonal changes during the puberty


---------12:11----------
time so a lot of people who have trouble


---------12:12----------
with acne sometimes the acne will


---------12:14----------
resolve once they're done with the the


---------12:16----------
hormonal changes


---------12:18----------
in women you'll also see primary and


---------12:19----------
sexual secondary sexual characteristics


---------12:22----------
develop so you'll also see the


---------12:23----------
development of things like pubic hair


---------12:25----------
and things like that breast development


---------12:27----------
the most important thing that uh


---------12:29----------
you know most women experience is the


---------12:31----------
onset of menses or menstruation so they


---------12:35----------
have an ovulatory cycle which we're


---------12:38----------
going to talk about right now because


---------12:39----------
this will be important later


---------12:41----------
so there's like a cycle of ovulation


---------12:43----------
which results in menstruation and so


---------12:45----------
menstruation is when


---------12:48----------
essentially the uterine lining


---------12:51----------
and then women will start to


---------12:54----------
essentially bleed right so let's go so


---------12:56----------
let's kind of talk about this for a


---------12:58----------
second


---------13:00----------
so this is where we're gonna get into


---------13:01----------
the science okay chat


---------13:03----------
y'all doing okay so far by the way like


---------13:05----------
are we okay with this


---------13:06----------
is this too much


---------13:13----------
okay we okay with that okay


---------13:17----------
okay you're confused so that's hopefully


---------13:19----------
we'll fix that in a little bit


---------13:22----------
the average female menstrual cycle is 28


---------13:24----------
days


---------13:25----------
that is because it is lined with lunar


---------13:27----------
rhythms no it's not aligned with


---------13:28----------
rhythms it's because of biology


---------13:31----------
so we start out with


---------13:33----------
um


---------13:34----------
so let's actually start in the middle


---------13:36----------
with ovulation


---------13:38----------
so there's this thing called a follicle


---------13:39----------
and a follicle kind of develops and then


---------13:42----------
we get like a big follicle which has an


---------13:44----------
egg inside and then at ovulation the egg


---------13:46----------
comes out after that the follicle kind


---------13:49----------
of


---------13:50----------
gets smaller again it degrades and then


---------13:52----------
over here we have menses


---------13:55----------
at day 28 or actually over here is


---------13:58----------
menses at day zero


---------14:00----------
okay


---------14:01----------
and so this is like where we have


---------14:02----------
menstruation so


---------14:04----------
basically like once we have an egg that


---------14:07----------
leaves the follicle this is the zone


---------14:09----------
we've got basically one week where you


---------14:11----------
can get pregnant


---------14:13----------
because now we've ovulated we've got an


---------14:15----------
egg we're ready for the sperm if the


---------14:17----------
sperm meets the egg


---------14:19----------
then we will get a


---------14:22----------
pregnancy right so we'll form like an


---------14:24----------
embryo or a zygote


---------14:26----------
and then that follicle will go and


---------14:28----------
implant in the uterine lining so this is


---------14:31----------
like let's say this is the uterus here's


---------14:33----------
the uterine lining here and so this egg


---------14:35----------
will go over here and implant over here


---------14:37----------
here are the fallopian tubes


---------14:40----------
okay


---------14:41----------
ovaries


---------14:42----------
so that's kind of what what happens so


---------14:44----------
over here like if by the end of one week


---------14:47----------
if we don't have a uterine lining that


---------14:49----------
has an egg implanted into it essentially


---------14:51----------
what happens is we get all of this


---------14:53----------
uterine lining that sheds so this all


---------14:56----------
goes away


---------14:57----------
and then kind of comes out as blood so


---------14:59----------
this is the process of menstruation


---------15:02----------
and then you kind of


---------15:03----------
um prepare the whole cycle again


---------15:06----------
now the next thing to understand about


---------15:07----------
this whole cycle is that it's hormonally


---------15:10----------
driven and this is going to become


---------15:11----------
important when we talk a little bit


---------15:12----------
about


---------15:13----------
um


---------15:15----------
different kinds of birth control okay


---------15:18----------
so essentially what happens during this


---------15:20----------
this time is that we've got


---------15:22----------
um


---------15:26----------
so we've got this hormone here called


---------15:28----------
fsh which is going to slowly increase


---------15:31----------
and then we've got another hormone


---------15:32----------
called lh which is going to be like


---------15:34----------
relatively low


---------15:36----------
um


---------15:38----------
and then surges over here which triggers


---------15:40----------
ovulation and then it kind of stays low


---------15:43----------
again


---------15:44----------
and so


---------15:45----------
fsh is is follicle stimulating hormone


---------15:47----------
so this is going to cause


---------15:49----------
fsh is what causes these follicles to


---------15:51----------
grow and so fsh over time is going to


---------15:53----------
actually kind of go down like once we


---------15:55----------
have our follicle that's ready to go


---------15:57----------
then fsh decreases


---------15:59----------
and then this lh surge that that's in


---------16:01----------
blue is what triggers off ovulation so


---------16:04----------
essentially fsh is going to prepare


---------16:08----------
us for ovulation the lh surge is what


---------16:12----------
triggers this egg egg leaving


---------16:14----------
and then both hormones tend to go down


---------16:17----------
as we enter the luteal phase


---------16:19----------
and um we end up with menses after that


---------16:23----------
okay this is going to become important


---------16:24----------
in a second when we talk a little bit


---------16:26----------
about birth control okay so let me grab


---------16:28----------
my notes


---------16:30----------
so


---------16:32----------
this is the process of menstruation any


---------16:34----------
questions


---------16:38----------
we'll talk about pcos and stuff like


---------16:40----------
that okay


---------16:42----------
so menses is the process of shedding the


---------16:45----------
uterine lining


---------16:47----------
so like when when an egg does not


---------16:49----------
implant


---------16:52----------
let's use purple


---------16:53----------
so when this process does not happen


---------16:56----------
okay


---------16:57----------
so if this egg gets fertilized by a


---------16:59----------
sperm it'll go and it'll hang out it'll


---------17:01----------
implant into the wall of the uterus


---------17:04----------
where it will start to grow into a child


---------17:07----------
and if that process doesn't happen the


---------17:09----------
body sort of realizes okay it looks like


---------17:12----------
we don't have


---------17:14----------
a


---------17:15----------
viable embryo


---------17:17----------
that we can't carry to create a child so


---------17:20----------
all of this uterine lining that we built


---------17:22----------
up we're actually going to get rid of


---------17:24----------
and then we'll start the cycle all over


---------17:25----------
again


---------17:27----------
okay so that's what menses is it's


---------17:29----------
essentially shedding the uterine lining


---------17:32----------
interesting tidbit


---------17:33----------
unfortunately menses is one of the only


---------17:36----------
necrotic processes in the body so when a


---------17:39----------
cell dies


---------17:41----------
normally it goes through this this cycle


---------17:43----------
called apoptosis


---------17:46----------
which is programmed cell death


---------17:49----------
interesting aside okay


---------17:50----------
so


---------17:52----------
did y'all know that between your fingers


---------17:55----------
you used to have webbing so our fingers


---------17:58----------
used to be connected by skin but what


---------18:00----------
happens when we


---------18:02----------
when our body is developing is like


---------18:03----------
there's skin that connects our fingers


---------18:06----------
and then the body sort of realizes the


---------18:07----------
skin in the middle realizes hey we don't


---------18:09----------
need to be here anymore so it actually


---------18:11----------
goes through a process of programmed


---------18:12----------
zelda and it dies


---------18:14----------
so sometimes when cells get old


---------18:15----------
sometimes if cells get cancerous they'll


---------18:18----------
actually like auto destruct and the cool


---------18:20----------
thing about apoptosis is that generally


---------18:22----------
speaking when it happens it's not


---------18:23----------
painful it's like a normal thing it's


---------18:25----------
like basically we're shutting down the


---------18:26----------
cell


---------18:28----------
necrosis is different necrosis is what


---------18:32----------
happens like when i get you know crushed


---------18:34----------
by like you know a brick


---------18:37----------
or when i get


---------18:38----------
damaged in some way


---------18:40----------
that's like cell death that was not


---------18:42----------
planned and so necrosis releases a bunch


---------18:44----------
of inflammatory things


---------18:47----------
re releases substance p


---------18:51----------
which causes pain


---------18:53----------
which is why like menses is so freaking


---------18:56----------
painful and disco uncomfortable because


---------18:58----------
it's one of the only necrotic processes


---------19:00----------
in the body it's essentially like


---------19:02----------
getting dead like it's taking internal


---------19:04----------
damage as opposed to like winding things


---------19:06----------
down which is what apoptosis is so


---------19:08----------
that's part of the reason why menses is


---------19:10----------
like tends to be like quite


---------19:12----------
uncomfortable and quite painful for


---------19:13----------
women there are other things that kind


---------19:14----------
of complement complicate that but i


---------19:17----------
think it's one thing to kind of


---------19:18----------
understand is like a dude like it helped


---------19:20----------
me kind of recognize that


---------19:22----------
you know i don't think we sort of


---------19:23----------
realize as men we're not taught that


---------19:25----------
like there's actually like a part of


---------19:28----------
your partner's body that is like


---------19:30----------
dying


---------19:31----------
and it's painful and uncomfortable and


---------19:33----------
inflammatory and causes like that's why


---------19:35----------
you get like you know belly pain


---------19:37----------
abdominal pain discomfort bloating all


---------19:40----------
that stuff is happening because you have


---------19:42----------
this necrotic process going on which is


---------19:44----------
not like as peaceful and organized as


---------19:46----------
the apoptosis


---------19:49----------
oh the egg cell is the egg cell necrosis


---------19:51----------
as well but the egg cell is tiny it's


---------19:53----------
just once one cell you have a whole


---------19:55----------
uterine lining


---------19:56----------
that


---------19:57----------
is


---------19:59----------
going to like


---------20:00----------
essentially die i mean it gets slopped


---------20:03----------
off right and that's what menses


---------20:07----------
okay


---------20:08----------
anyway enough about menses let's move on


---------20:11----------
you guys have


---------20:12----------
yeah every month it ain't easy so i


---------20:15----------
don't think most men you know really


---------20:17----------
ever experienced something along the


---------20:19----------
lines of like it's like kind of getting


---------20:21----------
the flu like on a monthly basis right


---------20:22----------
it's just like this period of time for


---------20:24----------
one week where you're just like kind of


---------20:26----------
feeling crappy and in in some relative


---------20:28----------
amount of pain it's just and it happens


---------20:30----------
every day a month


---------20:31----------
right until menopause which is a whole


---------20:33----------
other mess


---------20:35----------
and uncomfortable but okay so basics of


---------20:37----------
menstruation that's going to become


---------20:38----------
important in a second because we're


---------20:40----------
going to talk about birth control


---------20:43----------
so next thing that we're going to talk


---------20:44----------
about is like so now that we have a


---------20:46----------
basic understanding okay so puberty


---------20:48----------
happens right so people start to develop


---------20:50----------
women have this hormonal cycle that


---------20:53----------
results in menses if you have sex during


---------20:55----------
the week i mean during that one week or


---------20:59----------
you can even have a little bit before


---------21:00----------
but you know there's basically a one


---------21:02----------
week window i'm oversimplifying where a


---------21:04----------
woman can get pregnant every month okay


---------21:07----------
and so when we talk about so let's move


---------21:09----------
on a little bit to safe sex


---------21:12----------
so like i said earlier a lot of times


---------21:14----------
parents will ask their kids hey are you


---------21:15----------
being safe and the kid is like yes


---------21:17----------
and nowhere do we ever discuss like okay


---------21:19----------
what are the dimensions of safety so


---------21:21----------
when i talk to my patients about you


---------21:23----------
know safe sex i will talk about three or


---------21:25----------
four different things so one is i will


---------21:27----------
talk about birth control the second i


---------21:29----------
will thing i will talk about is stis


---------21:31----------
because oftentimes those two things get


---------21:32----------
confused i know it's kind of weird


---------21:35----------
um the third thing is sometimes we can


---------21:37----------
talk about pain


---------21:39----------
uh which is like there are some


---------21:40----------
conditions that are relatively common


---------21:42----------
which result in people having


---------21:44----------
uncomfortable sexual experiences the


---------21:46----------
challenge with those conditions is that


---------21:48----------
the person feels like fundamentally


---------21:50----------
messed up there's a lot of shame


---------21:52----------
associated with these conditions


---------21:54----------
so sometimes um


---------21:56----------
you know people think that they're like


---------21:57----------
not able to have sex or like that


---------21:59----------
everyone else is enjoying sex and they


---------22:01----------
don't enjoy sex it's actually painful


---------22:03----------
for them so they think that there's


---------22:04----------
something wrong with them and in a sense


---------22:06----------
there kind of is because there can be


---------22:07----------
like a medical problem but it's not like


---------22:09----------
an issue of like you as a person it's


---------22:11----------
like your body may be responding to


---------22:13----------
sexual activity and like uh you know in


---------22:15----------
a pathologic way so they're actually


---------22:17----------
conditions that lead to pain during sex


---------22:20----------
and so sometimes it's about educating


---------22:22----------
people about that kind of thing so just


---------22:24----------
to give you guys an example you know i


---------22:25----------
had a female patient who


---------22:28----------
um had a lot of difficulty having sex


---------22:30----------
and it turned out she had a medical


---------22:31----------
condition but like she didn't realize


---------22:33----------
that for years she would just


---------22:35----------
you know try to engage in sexual


---------22:37----------
relationships with men and found it


---------22:38----------
incredibly incredibly painful


---------22:41----------
um and so it was like like she just


---------22:44----------
thought


---------22:45----------
like she was busted as like a human she


---------22:48----------
was like i can't ever you know i can


---------22:49----------
sexually gratify my partners but it's


---------22:51----------
like painful every single time i do it i


---------22:53----------
care about them so much i even love them


---------22:56----------
and and like but like something's wrong


---------22:58----------
with me like i can't like i don't know


---------23:00----------
you know like i can't i don't enjoy it i


---------23:02----------
feel like vomiting every time i have sex


---------23:04----------
and it's like you know she comes into my


---------23:05----------
office and it's like whoa right it's so


---------23:08----------
hard because she she understands that in


---------23:10----------
this society like sexual pleasure and


---------23:13----------
sexual gratification is a part of


---------23:14----------
relationships she feels really guilty


---------23:16----------
for like the way that her body responds


---------23:19----------
and it turns out that there could be a


---------23:20----------
medical reason for it so that's why we


---------23:21----------
have conversations like this okay


---------23:24----------
and then the dude too is like like he's


---------23:26----------
kind of at a loss as well this was a


---------23:28----------
situation where i talked to her partner


---------23:30----------
her fiance as well and and so like he


---------23:33----------
was kind of like you know i want to


---------23:34----------
respect her boundaries so i'm totally


---------23:36----------
fine


---------23:37----------
um you know not having sex and then like


---------23:39----------
he's willing to


---------23:41----------
give it up and then she feels super bad


---------23:43----------
and he feels super bad and like no one


---------23:45----------
feels good about anything


---------23:46----------
right it's despite all of the love and


---------23:48----------
all of the caring everyone's just like


---------23:50----------
stressed and nothing's going well and


---------23:52----------
they don't know if they're ever gonna


---------23:53----------
have kids and all this kind of stuff so


---------23:55----------
this is why like a little bit of


---------23:56----------
education actually goes a long way okay


---------23:59----------
so let's talk about


---------24:03----------
the different dimensions of


---------24:05----------
safe sex okay


---------24:07----------
so i don't know if we're going to get to


---------24:08----------
things like consent


---------24:10----------
but let's talk about


---------24:12----------
safe sex


---------24:14----------
so the first thing that we're going to


---------24:15----------
talk about so when you have safe sex the


---------24:17----------
first thing that you need to watch out


---------24:18----------
for is stis or sexually transmitted


---------24:21----------
infections okay so when we talk about


---------24:23----------
stis so for those of you that don't know


---------24:25----------
there are bacterial infections


---------24:32----------
and there are viral infections


---------24:35----------
okay so oftentimes bacterial infections


---------24:38----------
are things like gonorrhea


---------24:41----------
chlamydia


---------24:45----------
stuff like cis uh


---------24:47----------
syphilis


---------24:48----------
okay so so like oftentimes these


---------24:51----------
bacterial infections will cause things


---------24:53----------
like pain


---------24:55----------
discharge which is exactly what it


---------24:57----------
sounds like it's like there's like posts


---------24:59----------
or goop coming out of your sexual organs


---------25:02----------
the good news about bacterial infections


---------25:04----------
is that like we can basically treat it


---------25:06----------
with antibiotics


---------25:07----------
okay


---------25:09----------
so this is what's super sad is that if


---------25:11----------
you get a bacterial infection like you


---------25:12----------
can just take a course of antibiotics


---------25:14----------
just like get yourself some bactrim or


---------25:16----------
something like that and then in like six


---------25:17----------
or seven days the infection will be


---------25:19----------
cleared you'll be totally fine


---------25:21----------
okay and it's like not that big of a


---------25:23----------
deal


---------25:24----------
um generally speaking there isn't any


---------25:26----------
long-term damage this is why it's also


---------25:28----------
incredibly sad that people are not


---------25:29----------
educated to this kind of stuff so if you


---------25:31----------
do have a bacterial infection


---------25:34----------
what will happen a lot of times is like


---------25:36----------
you're let's assume a male patient for a


---------25:37----------
second your penis will start to hurt


---------25:39----------
it'll become red or swollen you'll start


---------25:42----------
to get goop coming out of it right


---------25:44----------
discharge


---------25:46----------
we're not going to show pictures


---------25:48----------
but


---------25:49----------
you know and then what happens is you


---------25:50----------
get embarrassed


---------25:52----------
and like you're like oh god like what is


---------25:53----------
wrong with me like what will people


---------25:55----------
think like will anyone find out and so


---------25:57----------
your embarrassment causes you to not


---------25:59----------
seek medical care and you're like i hope


---------26:01----------
it'll go away it's the tried and true


---------26:03----------
it's the first


---------26:04----------
you know medical intervention that most


---------26:06----------
human beings make the first medical


---------26:09----------
choice that most human beings make is i


---------26:11----------
hope it goes away because it's cool


---------26:13----------
because our body like takes care of most


---------26:14----------
things right you get a mosquito bite


---------26:15----------
it's not like you need to do anything


---------26:17----------
your body will take care of it you


---------26:18----------
sprain your ankle it's not like your


---------26:19----------
body you need to do anything but other


---------26:20----------
body will take care of it if you have


---------26:22----------
diarrhea or you start vomiting you get


---------26:24----------
fever like i'm just gonna like you


---------26:26----------
you're hungover you get drunk you know


---------26:28----------
you're you're like i'll just my body


---------26:30----------
will take care of it so a lot of people


---------26:32----------
will just let their body take care of it


---------26:33----------
that's a terrible idea when it comes to


---------26:35----------
stis especially bacterial ones because


---------26:37----------
you can take a seven course seven day


---------26:39----------
course of antibiotics and you could be


---------26:41----------
fixed but instead what will happen and


---------26:43----------
i've seen this and it's super sad


---------26:45----------
syphilis is a good example of like


---------26:47----------
penicillin treats syphilis okay


---------26:51----------
but like when people don't treat


---------26:52----------
syphilis and syphilis is also kind of


---------26:54----------
interesting because it actually presents


---------26:56----------
with something called a shanker which is


---------26:58----------
like a sore on let's say the penis that


---------27:01----------
is non-painful so like you wake up one


---------27:03----------
day and you're like there's like a


---------27:04----------
little like dot on your dick


---------27:06----------
and then like over time like the dot


---------27:08----------
grows and then you're like well that's


---------27:10----------
kind of weird it doesn't hurt or


---------27:11----------
anything it's just just a weird like


---------27:13----------
it's like an ulcer on the penis


---------27:16----------
and then you know it can even go away


---------27:18----------
and then people like okay fine or like


---------27:20----------
it'll come come and go but it doesn't


---------27:21----------
really hurt people won't take care of it


---------27:23----------
and so then syphilis can spread to


---------27:24----------
places like your spinal cord and like


---------27:26----------
cause nerve damage and like all this


---------27:28----------
other kind of terrible stuff and the sad


---------27:30----------
thing is that it's like super treatable


---------27:32----------
so generally speaking you know if you


---------27:34----------
have sex with someone and then something


---------27:36----------
weird happens to your genitals they


---------27:38----------
start to hurt you or you start to see


---------27:39----------
weird marks on them or things like that


---------27:41----------
go see a doctor


---------27:43----------
okay


---------27:45----------
now what's a little bit more troubling


---------27:46----------
we'll get to what what else to do about


---------27:48----------
this in a second so what's more


---------27:50----------
troubling is viral infections so herpes


---------27:52----------
is a good example of this


---------27:53----------
hiv is something that people are uh you


---------27:56----------
know understandably concerned about


---------27:58----------
so


---------27:59----------
the these are kind of interesting


---------28:01----------
because these are lifelong so once you


---------28:03----------
get a viral infection of herpes it's


---------28:04----------
never gonna i mean


---------28:06----------
the infection will stay there forever


---------28:09----------
something like hiv two is a lifelong


---------28:11----------
illness so once you catch it you know


---------28:14----------
you got it


---------28:15----------
so there are a couple of interesting


---------28:16----------
things though when it comes to herpes


---------28:18----------
and we're going to go off on an


---------28:19----------
interesting tangent here as well and


---------28:20----------
this has to do with viral evolution


---------28:23----------
so if we kind of think about let's say


---------28:24----------
i'm a virus


---------28:26----------
okay


---------28:28----------
these are spike proteins it's not a sun


---------28:31----------
if i'm a virus like and i infect a human


---------28:33----------
being


---------28:34----------
i've got a couple of different


---------28:35----------
strategies right like i can be very very


---------28:37----------
infectious


---------28:39----------
and then kill the human being


---------28:41----------
like let's say i'm ebola


---------28:44----------
right i can like kill a human being and


---------28:46----------
then like in the process i'm bleeding


---------28:48----------
and stuff and i infect other human


---------28:49----------
beings


---------28:52----------
but generally speaking these are not the


---------28:54----------
most successful viruses what's super


---------28:55----------
successful


---------28:57----------
is herpes


---------28:58----------
and so what herpes does is like kind of


---------29:00----------
bothers you but doesn't really affect


---------29:02----------
your survival


---------29:03----------
and so essentially what happens is some


---------29:05----------
viruses that we get will actually like


---------29:06----------
become relatively dormant and not too


---------29:09----------
much of a pain in the ass so i think


---------29:10----------
somewhere between 25 and 40 percent of


---------29:13----------
like the human population has herpes


---------29:17----------
and then you so you'll get these like


---------29:18----------
sores that will come and go so you'll


---------29:21----------
get like flares of herpes and then you


---------29:23----------
can start medication during those time


---------29:25----------
that will reduce the sores and stuff


---------29:26----------
like that but for many people like i


---------29:28----------
think maybe even 20 of people will never


---------29:30----------
be symptomatic or maybe 40 of people


---------29:33----------
will never be symptomatic with herpes so


---------29:35----------
they'll never have a sore or anything


---------29:37----------
like that the virus is just hanging out


---------29:38----------
in your body and you can even


---------29:40----------
potentially have a period of what's


---------29:42----------
called asymptomatic shedding so this is


---------29:44----------
something else to know about herpes um


---------29:46----------
is that even if you don't have any


---------29:48----------
active virus you can still transmit it


---------29:50----------
to other people


---------29:51----------
hiv is sort of the same way so remember


---------29:53----------
that hiv leads to something called aids


---------29:58----------
right which is acquired immune


---------30:00----------
autoimmune acquired immunodeficiency


---------30:02----------
syndrome


---------30:03----------
and so for many many years before people


---------30:07----------
develop aids they will have active viral


---------30:09----------
replication and can spread it to other


---------30:11----------
people


---------30:12----------
so aids is a so hiv is a virus that


---------30:15----------
attacks your immune cells and so aids is


---------30:17----------
not actually direct damage from the


---------30:19----------
virus what happens is hiv destroys your


---------30:22----------
immune system and then you get all of


---------30:24----------
these infections that like normally


---------30:26----------
human beings don't have to deal with


---------30:28----------
because your immune system just takes


---------30:29----------
care of them


---------30:30----------
it's kind of like you know if you're


---------30:32----------
playing a video game and and you can


---------30:33----------
normally like you know you're playing at


---------30:35----------
a high mmr and then someone goes and


---------30:37----------
unplugs your mouse and your keyboard and


---------30:39----------
then suddenly you start losing the noobs


---------30:41----------
like the reason you're losing to noobs


---------30:43----------
is because you can no longer play the


---------30:44----------
game that's why hiv is such a


---------30:46----------
devastating disease because it it


---------30:48----------
cripples your body's ability to actually


---------30:50----------
fight it


---------30:51----------
the key to thing to remember for this


---------30:53----------
scope of of this talk is first of all


---------30:56----------
even if you've never had symptoms of


---------30:58----------
these things you can still have them


---------31:01----------
right so this is like safety point


---------31:02----------
number one


---------31:05----------
with viral


---------31:07----------
stis


---------31:10----------
you can be asymptomatic


---------31:15----------
and still have it


---------31:18----------
you can be asymptomatic


---------31:21----------
and still spread it


---------31:25----------
right your partner can even be


---------31:27----------
asymptomatic and you can still have it


---------31:29----------
so this is why like if you've had we'll


---------31:31----------
talk about this in a second if you've


---------31:33----------
ever had you know sex with a with


---------31:36----------
another human being


---------31:38----------
without a condom or a female condom or


---------31:41----------
something like that then you are at risk


---------31:43----------
of having an sti the only really case


---------31:46----------
that i can think of where that's


---------31:47----------
unlikely is that both of you have never


---------31:49----------
had sex with anyone else and even then


---------31:51----------
in rare situations you can get viral


---------31:53----------
transmission of things like hiv during


---------31:56----------
birth and stuff like that if your mom


---------31:57----------
had it or whatever but usually like


---------31:59----------
doctors know about that because we test


---------32:00----------
about we test that kind of thing before


---------32:02----------
mothers give birth


---------32:04----------
but generally speaking if your partner


---------32:06----------
has ever had sex without a condom with


---------32:08----------
anyone and you have had sex without a


---------32:10----------
condom with anyone


---------32:12----------
you are at risk of having a viral sti so


---------32:14----------
this is where like everyone


---------32:17----------
should get tested


---------32:22----------
right because you never know like if


---------32:23----------
your partner is lying to you or honest


---------32:24----------
or whatever so generally speaking for


---------32:26----------
young sexually active patients i


---------32:28----------
recommend they get tested at a minimum


---------32:31----------
of once per year


---------32:32----------
depending on how high risk you are you


---------32:34----------
can get tested even more


---------32:36----------
okay


---------32:38----------
so next thing to kind of think about is


---------32:40----------
all right so like how do we prevent


---------32:42----------
these things so this is where the the


---------32:43----------
condom comes in


---------32:46----------
so the condom is the best uh protective


---------32:49----------
barrier against you know transmission of


---------32:52----------
both bacterial and viral infections


---------32:55----------
so wearing a condom has two goals so


---------32:58----------
condom is to protect against stis


---------33:04----------
and actually it's it's interesting how


---------33:06----------
many people don't realize this


---------33:09----------
i personally find it my mind-boggling


---------33:11----------
but


---------33:12----------
you know it just speaks to how


---------33:14----------
our systems of education are and the


---------33:15----------
second is to prevent pregnancy


---------33:18----------
and these


---------33:20----------
are two distinct


---------33:22----------
goals okay


---------33:24----------
so this is where like you know i've had


---------33:26----------
patients


---------33:27----------
that


---------33:28----------
you know will be like oh yeah so like i


---------33:30----------
hooked up with a girl and i was like


---------33:32----------
okay were you safe and they were like


---------33:33----------
yeah


---------33:34----------
and i then i asked the question like


---------33:36----------
what do you you know what do you mean


---------33:37----------
it's like oh like i asked her she's on


---------33:39----------
the pill it's like not a big deal right


---------33:41----------
so like safe sometimes people mean like


---------33:44----------
getting pregnant


---------33:45----------
and sometimes they mean like protecting


---------33:47----------
against an sti


---------33:49----------
and it's like so then i'll ask my


---------33:50----------
patient i was like did you actually use


---------33:52----------
a condom and he's like no i didn't need


---------33:53----------
to because she's on birth control it's


---------33:54----------
like not a big deal


---------33:56----------
right and even for people who are like


---------33:58----------
not even in the hookup stage i'll talk


---------34:00----------
to people who are in like monogamous


---------34:03----------
relationships yeah i've been dating a


---------34:04----------
girl for a year we used condoms for the


---------34:06----------
first six months


---------34:07----------
and then like you know then we stopped


---------34:09----------
using condoms because she was on the


---------34:10----------
pill


---------34:11----------
and like you know i trust her and it's


---------34:13----------
like okay fine even if you trust her has


---------34:15----------
she ever had sex without a condom with


---------34:17----------
anyone else have you ever had sex


---------34:18----------
without a condom with anyone else


---------34:20----------
and has has she ever been tested and


---------34:22----------
have you ever been tested the fact that


---------34:24----------
you're asymptomatic does not mean that


---------34:26----------
you know she could have asymptomatic hiv


---------34:28----------
you could have asymptomatic hiv


---------34:31----------
so condoms are the best way to protect


---------34:33----------
against stis um outside of you know


---------34:36----------
abstinence and stuff like that


---------34:38----------
and so that's really our goal so like


---------34:40----------
just thinking about you know dr k's like


---------34:42----------
two things that you should talk to a


---------34:44----------
doctor about


---------34:45----------
one is that if you've had


---------34:47----------
sex with another human being


---------34:49----------
without a condom


---------34:51----------
and both of you all are not virgins and


---------34:52----------
even if they say they're a virgin


---------34:55----------
because you you never really know right


---------34:56----------
it's it's a good thing to just go ahead


---------34:58----------
and get tested it's a cheap test most


---------35:00----------
doctors will order it just so you'll


---------35:01----------
have the peace of mind


---------35:03----------
um and then when you you know if you do


---------35:05----------
have sex with someone use a condom


---------35:07----------
because even if they're on birth control


---------35:08----------
like you just don't know


---------35:10----------
what they've got so like gonorrhea and


---------35:12----------
chlamydia too can be asymptomatic for a


---------35:14----------
while


---------35:15----------
and that's like how they spread right


---------35:16----------
because it's not like they


---------35:18----------
you know


---------35:19----------
like


---------35:20----------
they're they're actively replicating and


---------35:22----------
like there's not discharge and pain


---------35:24----------
coming out of your penis or your vagina


---------35:27----------
and then like then you have sex with


---------35:28----------
someone and then like they transmit it


---------35:30----------
here you transmit it and then you get it


---------35:31----------
and that's how it works okay questions


---------35:33----------
about stis


---------35:37----------
okay next thing we're going to talk


---------35:38----------
about is birth control


---------35:41----------
okay


---------35:42----------
so the first thing to understand is that


---------35:45----------
there are many kinds of birth control


---------35:47----------
now dr k is rusty on my statistics but


---------35:50----------
i'm just i think this is right but i


---------35:52----------
haven't really checked these statistics


---------35:53----------
in like 15 years


---------35:55----------
so methods of birth control number one


---------35:58----------
the pull-out method


---------36:00----------
so if you guys remember


---------36:02----------
there is a menstrual cycle


---------36:04----------
right so what some people will do is


---------36:06----------
like they'll you know


---------36:08----------
try to time it so this is the timing


---------36:10----------
method where we're only going to have


---------36:12----------
sex when


---------36:14----------
you know during the three weeks that


---------36:15----------
we're not ovulating so that's number one


---------36:18----------
pull out is number two which is like you


---------36:20----------
know if the dude doesn't ejaculate


---------36:22----------
in the vagina then you know that's a


---------36:24----------
method of birth control so i want to say


---------36:26----------
that


---------36:27----------
the pull out method is like 60 to 70


---------36:30----------
effective


---------36:31----------
so what does this mean so about last


---------36:34----------
time i checked which was some time ago


---------36:36----------
the statistics that i'm going to cite


---------36:38----------
are to be if a couple is having sex over


---------36:41----------
the course of the year


---------36:43----------
what is the likelihood they will wind up


---------36:46----------
pregnant or not uh yeah so let's let's


---------36:49----------
look at it this way


---------36:51----------
so this is efficacy


---------36:56----------
and what efficacy means is preventing


---------36:58----------
pregnancy


---------37:03----------
okay and so this is like you know


---------37:07----------
100 minus this number is the percent


---------37:09----------
chance that you'll get pregnant


---------37:11----------
over


---------37:12----------
one year


---------37:14----------
okay so what this means is like 30 to 40


---------37:16----------
percent of people who use the pull out


---------37:18----------
method will get pregnant i think the


---------37:20----------
timing method two is like pretty bad


---------37:23----------
it's like maybe a little bit higher i


---------37:25----------
don't really remember the exact


---------37:26----------
statistic so 20 to 30 percent of people


---------37:29----------
who like you know use this method will


---------37:31----------
still wind up pregnant if you have sex


---------37:33----------
over the course of a year and what some


---------37:35----------
people may be saying is about like the


---------37:36----------
pull out method doesn't that you know


---------37:39----------
what's up with that like so what are the


---------37:40----------
factors so the first is that


---------37:42----------
sometimes before you actually like have


---------37:44----------
an orgasm and ejaculate you'll actually


---------37:46----------
release some degree of semen so there's


---------37:49----------
like um you know there's the


---------37:50----------
pre-ejaculate which can sometimes have


---------37:52----------
semen so that's one thing the other


---------37:54----------
thing the other reason why it is so


---------37:55----------
effective because still at the end of


---------37:57----------
the day like two out of three people


---------37:59----------
that use the pull-out method at the end


---------38:00----------
of the year won't be pregnant and that's


---------38:02----------
because remember that you know 75 of the


---------38:05----------
time a woman isn't actually like 75 of


---------38:08----------
days of the year the average woman is


---------38:10----------
not able to get pregnant right so what


---------38:12----------
we're kind of talking about is like a


---------38:15----------
series of like you know


---------38:17----------
confluence of events so first of all she


---------38:19----------
has to be in the ovulatory window and


---------38:21----------
then like you have to have maybe


---------38:22----------
pre-ejaculate or sometimes you screw up


---------38:24----------
or like don't screw up like even if you


---------38:26----------
screw up there's a 75 chance that


---------38:29----------
their your partner's not going to get


---------38:31----------
pregnant right so that also depends on


---------38:33----------
things like frequency of sex and things


---------38:34----------
like that


---------38:35----------
so these pull out method timing method i


---------38:37----------
don't recommend them


---------38:40----------
next thing to think about is condoms


---------38:43----------
so condoms are actually 90 effective


---------38:47----------
at preventing pregnancy and what is that


---------38:49----------
how does that work well so it turns out


---------38:51----------
that a big part of like condom


---------38:53----------
effectiveness is like user error


---------38:57----------
so what this sort of means is that if i


---------38:59----------
have a partner and i'm going to uh okay


---------39:02----------
we're lagging if i have sex for the over


---------39:04----------
the course of a year


---------39:05----------
um


---------39:06----------
and


---------39:08----------
like 9 out of 10 people who use condoms


---------39:10----------
and have sex over the course of the year


---------39:12----------
won't wind up with a pregnancy 10 of


---------39:15----------
them will


---------39:16----------
okay so like some of this is like it's a


---------39:18----------
little bit unclear exactly what's


---------39:20----------
happening i don't think that generally


---------39:21----------
speaking you know condoms are faulty


---------39:24----------
there you know some people will store


---------39:26----------
them in places like their wallet or


---------39:27----------
things like that where it may degrade


---------39:29----------
like the the latex barrier or things


---------39:31----------
like that um i think that these are if


---------39:34----------
if memory serves these are like pretty


---------39:36----------
naturalistic studies so essentially what


---------39:38----------
they do


---------39:38----------
is they'll ask like


---------39:40----------
you know hundred people do you have sex


---------39:43----------
and they'll say yes and they'll say like


---------39:44----------
you know did you did you get pregnant or


---------39:46----------
do you use a condom they'll say yes and


---------39:47----------
they'll say like did you get pregnant


---------39:49----------
and then 10 of people will say yes


---------39:51----------
so we kind of rate the efficacy of


---------39:53----------
condoms at 90


---------39:55----------
okay


---------39:57----------
um which is actually terrifying to me


---------39:59----------
personally


---------40:01----------
so next thing to kind of think a little


---------40:02----------
bit about is


---------40:04----------
the birth control pill


---------40:09----------
so what the birth control pill basically


---------40:11----------
is is


---------40:12----------
estrogen


---------40:14----------
and progesterone


---------40:15----------
but there are


---------40:17----------
progesterone only versions


---------40:21----------
and the birth control pill i think is


---------40:23----------
something like you know 95 to 97


---------40:27----------
effective


---------40:28----------
so we're talking about three to five


---------40:30----------
percent pregnancy rate


---------40:31----------
and the key thing about the pill is you


---------40:33----------
basically are taking hormones for three


---------40:35----------
weeks out of the month


---------40:36----------
and then i if memory serves properly


---------40:38----------
there's like one week where


---------40:40----------
you know it's it's not quite placebo but


---------40:42----------
there's a dif they're different hormonal


---------40:43----------
formulations that will allow you to


---------40:45----------
menstruate and basically the way that


---------40:47----------
birth control pills work is we're adding


---------40:49----------
estrogen and progesterone which by the


---------40:52----------
way this follicle produces progesterone


---------40:57----------
and you know these hormonal things are


---------40:59----------
creating estrogen


---------41:02----------
so essentially what happens is like


---------41:05----------
when you have progesterone and estrogen


---------41:07----------
floating around


---------41:08----------
these are going to block


---------41:11----------
production of gnrh which in turn


---------41:15----------
will block


---------41:19----------
production of fsh and lh


---------41:22----------
right so for those of y'all that are


---------41:24----------
kind of familiar with this basically the


---------41:25----------
way that our our body works


---------41:27----------
is through hormonal feedback loops


---------41:30----------
and so if estrogen and progesterone are


---------41:32----------
low


---------41:32----------
gnrh from our hypothalamus gonadotropin


---------41:35----------
releasing hormone will increase which


---------41:38----------
will cause these to increase and as


---------41:40----------
these increase will go towards ovulation


---------41:42----------
and as we go to ovulation we're going to


---------41:44----------
produce more progesterone so then this


---------41:46----------
then goes up and then once this goes up


---------41:49----------
this goes down you guys see it's like a


---------41:51----------
feedback loop


---------41:52----------
okay so we can draw it out over here


---------41:54----------
real quick


---------41:56----------
so we've got gnrh


---------41:59----------
increases fsh


---------42:01----------
and lh this is a little bit of a


---------42:02----------
simplification causes ovulation


---------42:06----------
which in turn creates progesterone


---------42:11----------
right and these are actually going to


---------42:12----------
create estrogen over here too let's go


---------42:15----------
this way


---------42:17----------
and then these in turn go and block


---------42:22----------
this


---------42:23----------
right so so it's it's like a feedback


---------42:25----------
loop where


---------42:26----------
the greater this is eventually it'll


---------42:28----------
produce downstream hormones that will


---------42:30----------
reduce this growth and as we reduce this


---------42:33----------
growth the inhibition decreases and it


---------42:36----------
increases gnrh that's how our body like


---------42:38----------
balances things so if we think about


---------42:41----------
things like our blood pressure right so


---------42:42----------
how does our body maintain a blood


---------42:44----------
pressure of 120 over 80. it has a system


---------42:46----------
of feedback loops you have things like


---------42:48----------
baroreceptors


---------42:52----------
so what a barrel receptor does is


---------42:54----------
measures the stretch


---------42:57----------
within your blood vessels and so if


---------42:59----------
there if the pressure is greater it's


---------43:01----------
going to stretch more


---------43:02----------
activate the baroreceptor and cause you


---------43:05----------
to decrease the strength at which your


---------43:07----------
heart pumps which will reduce the amount


---------43:09----------
of stretch in your blood vessels which


---------43:11----------
will then tone down the signal on the


---------43:13----------
baroreceptor you guys with me or is that


---------43:15----------
like too complicated


---------43:17----------
you guys get that


---------43:22----------
no


---------43:24----------
okay


---------43:25----------
okay the the general principle is


---------43:28----------
there's a feedback loop


---------43:30----------
right like everything like so our body


---------43:32----------
maintains a blood pressure of 120 over


---------43:34----------
80 because it's got like signals that


---------43:36----------
make sure that if we if we go below 120


---------43:39----------
or 80 over 80 we'll increase our blood


---------43:42----------
pressure and we have ways of detecting


---------43:43----------
that


---------43:44----------
and if we go above 120 over 80 we have


---------43:46----------
ways of detecting that and we'll drop


---------43:48----------
our blood pressure


---------43:49----------
okay


---------43:51----------
we'll talk about mood and stuff in a


---------43:52----------
second all right so let's go back


---------43:54----------
so why is birth control only 95 to 97


---------43:58----------
percent effective once again it's user


---------44:00----------
error


---------44:02----------
so generally speaking if you're taking


---------44:04----------
your birth control properly and you're


---------44:06----------
taking it on time and stuff like that it


---------44:08----------
is theoretically close to 100 percent


---------44:10----------
effective but it turns out that human


---------44:13----------
beings sometimes don't take their pills


---------44:15----------
on time they miss a day whatever


---------44:18----------
and so if you don't take your pills


---------44:20----------
properly


---------44:21----------
you have a three to five percent chance


---------44:23----------
of getting


---------44:24----------
uh pregnant


---------44:25----------
so then


---------44:26----------
um after that what we've got is the


---------44:28----------
patch or the implant


---------44:32----------
so then what people decided is we're


---------44:34----------
going to develop essentially a birth


---------44:35----------
control patch or implant


---------44:37----------
so what this is is it's like something


---------44:39----------
that you can get like


---------44:41----------
like on your arm usually like under the


---------44:43----------
skin like an implant that will release


---------44:46----------
progesterone estrogen and progesterone


---------44:48----------
and i think these are essentially 99


---------44:50----------
effective so once you remove user error


---------44:52----------
from the equation


---------44:54----------
99 times out of 100 like people won't be


---------44:57----------
able to get pregnant


---------44:58----------
okay


---------44:59----------
um so this is where like you know the


---------45:02----------
hormones themselves are gonna are damn


---------45:05----------
near perfect it's just the you know once


---------45:08----------
you force people to take pills it


---------45:09----------
becomes problematic so for example


---------45:11----------
this is why you should you should


---------45:13----------
actually consult with a doctor like if i


---------45:15----------
have a patient with adhd


---------45:18----------
i'm going to you know talk to them about


---------45:20----------
getting a patch or an implant over the


---------45:22----------
pills because if you've got adhd your


---------45:24----------
likelihood of user error and forgetting


---------45:26----------
to take pills is greater now this is a


---------45:28----------
conversation with the person i've had a


---------45:29----------
lot of patients with adhd that like they


---------45:32----------
may forget everything else in the


---------45:34----------
universe but the one thing that they


---------45:35----------
always take like clockwork is gonna be


---------45:37----------
their birth control medication so it's


---------45:39----------
not like necessarily like adhd people


---------45:40----------
can't take birth control meds it's just


---------45:42----------
you have to have a conversation and this


---------45:44----------
is where the individualization of your


---------45:46----------
condition like is important okay


---------45:48----------
then the last thing that we're going to


---------45:49----------
talk about is an iud or not last thing


---------45:52----------
but the last birth control for women


---------45:55----------
outside of surgery is an iud so this is


---------45:58----------
an intrauterine device so remember


---------46:01----------
over here what an intrauterine device is


---------46:03----------
is they take like a


---------46:05----------
a piece of like they stick a device into


---------46:08----------
the uterus now remember that the uterus


---------46:10----------
is like beyond the vagina right so


---------46:13----------
here's the cervix


---------46:14----------
which is like the gatehouse to the


---------46:16----------
uterus and then here's the vagina


---------46:18----------
so it's something that's implanted


---------46:20----------
within the uterus so oftentimes these


---------46:22----------
devices are made of copper


---------46:25----------
and since they're copper they actually


---------46:27----------
cause inflammation


---------46:29----------
in the uterine wall and this


---------46:30----------
inflammation in the uterine wall


---------46:32----------
prevents the egg from being able to


---------46:35----------
implant so you can actually create a


---------46:37----------
fertilized egg but it just can't ever


---------46:39----------
implant into the uterine wall so it's


---------46:40----------
never going to grow you're never going


---------46:42----------
to get pregnant


---------46:44----------
so


---------46:45----------
iuds come in just the copper variety or


---------46:50----------
copper plus hormone usually progesterone


---------46:53----------
and these are also like ninety nine


---------46:55----------
point nine percent effective


---------46:58----------
maybe it's nine it's greater than let's


---------47:00----------
i don't know that it's 99.9 i actually


---------47:02----------
don't know


---------47:04----------
but


---------47:06----------
they're also removable so the the copper


---------47:09----------
one lasts for about five years or maybe


---------47:11----------
longer actually i think the copper one


---------47:13----------
may last longer the hormonal one so it


---------47:16----------
also


---------47:16----------
releases progesterone which if we go


---------47:19----------
back up here we remember that it's this


---------47:21----------
progesterone that essentially acts as


---------47:23----------
your body's internal birth control so


---------47:26----------
when we take birth control pills we're


---------47:28----------
actually like trying to simulate this


---------47:30----------
thing that prevents you from getting


---------47:31----------
pregnant


---------47:33----------
okay so for example


---------47:34----------
um and the the term progesterone means


---------47:37----------
progestation so even the placenta will


---------47:40----------
release progesterone to prevent like you


---------47:43----------
from ovulating while you're pregnant if


---------47:44----------
that kind of makes sense


---------47:46----------
okay


---------47:47----------
so these are 99 effective you know


---------47:50----------
they're in your body for i'm a little


---------47:52----------
bit rusty on this i think the the


---------47:53----------
hormonal one is five years


---------47:55----------
the copper one may be more it may be


---------47:57----------
like ten years i'm not entirely sure


---------48:00----------
um


---------48:01----------
but this is basically you know so you


---------48:03----------
have a one percent chance or less of


---------48:06----------
getting pregnant


---------48:08----------
so if you are a young sexually active


---------48:10----------
woman who doesn't want to worry about


---------48:12----------
anything and is not planning on getting


---------48:13----------
pregnant for about five years this is


---------48:16----------
what i would recommend so for most of my


---------48:18----------
patients when they ask me dr k what kind


---------48:20----------
of birth control should i take


---------48:22----------
unless they've got other factors which


---------48:23----------
we'll talk about in a second like


---------48:25----------
basically like iuds are great because


---------48:26----------
you kind of fire and forget


---------48:28----------
and then when you're ready to get


---------48:29----------
pregnant you can take it out right or


---------48:31----------
you have to change it out every five


---------48:32----------
years so it tends to be like very very


---------48:35----------
like you know there's no hormones being


---------48:37----------
put in even with implants and patches


---------48:39----------
you have to kind of get them changed


---------48:40----------
it's like you go once you get an


---------48:42----------
appointment you get an iud like they're


---------48:44----------
really fantastic


---------48:45----------
so outside of this we also have um


---------48:48----------
[Music]


---------48:49----------
procedures right so we have tubal


---------48:50----------
ligation


---------48:53----------
which is getting your tubes tied


---------48:57----------
which is damn near 100 effective


---------49:00----------
and then we also have vasectomy


---------49:02----------
which is


---------49:05----------
close to 100 effectiveness


---------49:08----------
and what this is when you have a tubal


---------49:10----------
ligation remember that


---------49:12----------
the follicle starts here


---------49:14----------
in your ovaries and it travels down the


---------49:16----------
tube


---------49:17----------
and then will like ovulate and so a


---------49:20----------
tubal ligation is basically closing this


---------49:22----------
off


---------49:23----------
and so then your ovaries can never


---------49:26----------
the the follicles and eggs from your


---------49:27----------
ovaries can never get to your uterus


---------49:29----------
which basically makes it impossible for


---------49:31----------
you to get pregnant now there are some


---------49:33----------
risks uh with tubal ligation like


---------49:35----------
sometimes you can have like um you know


---------49:37----------
an ectopic pregnancy and stuff like that


---------49:39----------
but that's kind of beyond the scope of


---------49:40----------
this an ectopic pregnancy is a pregnancy


---------49:42----------
that implants somewhere outside of the


---------49:45----------
uterus so sometimes you can even get


---------49:47----------
implantation of an egg over here in the


---------49:48----------
fallopian tube and that can be really


---------49:50----------
dangerous


---------49:51----------
but it's quite rare


---------49:53----------
so and then vasectomy is when um you


---------49:56----------
know men will essentially have so we've


---------49:58----------
got


---------49:59----------
you know our scrotum


---------50:01----------
and then we've got tubes


---------50:03----------
that connect to our


---------50:04----------
penis


---------50:06----------
and so a vasectomy is when we kind of


---------50:07----------
slip the snip these


---------50:09----------
so that the sperm can never get into the


---------50:12----------
penis and yes this is a bad penis on


---------50:14----------
purpose


---------50:17----------
i'm sure i could draw a slightly better


---------50:19----------
anatomical penis but i'm choosing not to


---------50:22----------
okay chat


---------50:23----------
because [ __ ] y'all


---------50:29----------
okay


---------50:32----------
okay so so vasectomy and tubal ligation


---------50:34----------
so some of these can also be


---------50:36----------
um


---------50:38----------
they can be like reversible to a certain


---------50:40----------
degree but generally speaking when


---------50:42----------
you're done having kids and you never


---------50:44----------
want kids again this is like the the


---------50:46----------
birth control of choice


---------50:47----------
okay


---------50:49----------
so questions about


---------50:50----------
birth control


---------50:58----------
okay


---------51:00----------
and then if you want a troll if you guys


---------51:01----------
want to get into it then there's also


---------51:03----------
there's another


---------51:04----------
um


---------51:07----------
100 percent


---------51:12----------
effectiveness of birth control which is


---------51:14----------
being challenger rank at league of


---------51:16----------
legends


---------51:17----------
right this is something that is a male


---------51:18----------
birth control that results in 100


---------51:20----------
percent efficacy of pregnancy prevention


---------51:24----------
we good


---------51:26----------
[Laughter]


---------51:29----------
[Music]


---------51:31----------
okay


---------51:33----------
so uh okay so that's that's birth


---------51:36----------
control so you guys get that so like


---------51:37----------
okay big picture for a second


---------51:40----------
all right so when we talk about safe sex


---------51:42----------
two major dimensions of safety


---------51:44----------
one is stis


---------51:46----------
key thing to remember about stis


---------51:48----------
they can be asymptomatic for a while and


---------51:50----------
you can still transmit and get them so


---------51:52----------
if you've been sexually active without a


---------51:54----------
condom


---------51:55----------
you should probably get tested at a


---------51:57----------
minimum of like once a year for patients


---------51:59----------
that i have that are more high risk i'll


---------52:01----------
recommend more frequent testing


---------52:04----------
um so


---------52:06----------
best way to protect against stis are to


---------52:09----------
get a co to use condoms the other thing


---------52:11----------
that i recommend in terms of like safe


---------52:13----------
sex is like if you don't want to use a


---------52:15----------
condom you get tested your partner gets


---------52:17----------
tested you guys are in a trusting i


---------52:20----------
ideally monogamous relationship you're


---------52:21----------
in a poly relationship i guess it's fine


---------52:23----------
as long as everyone gets tested so


---------52:25----------
everyone within your sexual group


---------52:27----------
gets tested and is going to be exclusive


---------52:29----------
with each other so you can't get


---------52:30----------
contamination from the outside


---------52:32----------
and then once you have birth control


---------52:34----------
like you can start to you know have sex


---------52:35----------
without a condom no big deal


---------52:37----------
second reason we use condoms are to


---------52:40----------
um


---------52:42----------
prevent


---------52:44----------
pregnancy right but that's when we open


---------52:46----------
things up to birth control so condoms


---------52:48----------
tend to be the number one male form of


---------52:50----------
birth control vasectomy is quite extreme


---------52:54----------
um and then you know like there are lots


---------52:56----------
of other forms that primarily have to be


---------52:59----------
on the woman's side


---------53:00----------
and uh those tend to be


---------53:02----------
you know like a lot of people will start


---------53:04----------
the pill


---------53:05----------
um the birth control pill which you know


---------53:07----------
you have to take every day there can be


---------53:08----------
implants you guys can do things like


---------53:10----------
iuds so you just have to figure out you


---------53:12----------
know what's the right move for you and


---------53:14----------
what you're comfortable with


---------53:16----------
okay so having safe sex in summary i


---------53:19----------
think involves like two things


---------53:21----------
one is like protecting against stis the


---------53:23----------
second is protecting against pregnancy


---------53:28----------
yeah you can also do shots so there's


---------53:29----------
like other forms of birth control and


---------53:30----------
stuff like this isn't complete by any


---------53:32----------
means so for example we didn't talk


---------53:34----------
about fungal infections this can be kind


---------53:36----------
of annoying because like a woman can


---------53:37----------
have a fungal infection you can pass it


---------53:39----------
to a man the woman's will self-resolve


---------53:42----------
and then the man gets it and then passes


---------53:44----------
it back to the woman you can like pass


---------53:45----------
it back and forth


---------53:48----------
um


---------53:52----------
so yeah


---------53:57----------
okay


---------54:00----------
now what we're gonna do is talk a little


---------54:01----------
bit i see that there's some questions


---------54:02----------
we'll get to those in a second so now


---------54:04----------
we're gonna get to a couple of common


---------54:06----------
conditions


---------54:08----------
um that i think like


---------54:10----------
people


---------54:11----------
tend to deal with


---------54:15----------
so a lot of these conditions so this is


---------54:17----------
like the normal sexual stuff and then


---------54:19----------
there are a lot of things that people


---------54:20----------
will deal with


---------54:21----------
that are


---------54:23----------
that result in pain and discomfort


---------54:25----------
that they're kind of not aware of and


---------54:27----------
educating about them educating about


---------54:30----------
these conditions can be really helpful


---------54:31----------
at having like a healthy sexual


---------54:34----------
relationship okay so the first is we're


---------54:36----------
going to talk about phimosis


---------54:39----------
and vaginismus


---------54:43----------
so phimosis so for those of you that


---------54:46----------
don't know here's a bad penis drawing


---------54:47----------
again


---------54:48----------
there is this thing called the foreskin


---------54:51----------
which is like a piece of skin that kind


---------54:53----------
of covers the penis


---------54:55----------
and when


---------54:56----------
when the


---------54:58----------
when the penis becomes erect


---------55:02----------
the force like you know the penis kind


---------55:03----------
of


---------55:04----------
it's gonna


---------55:05----------
the penis elongates


---------55:08----------
right and then the foreskin kind of


---------55:09----------
hangs back over here


---------55:11----------
so there's actually a condition called


---------55:13----------
phimosis


---------55:14----------
where


---------55:16----------
the


---------55:17----------
the foreskin is basically like very


---------55:19----------
tight and you can't really pull it back


---------55:21----------
so when you get an erection like you


---------55:24----------
can't


---------55:25----------
open up the foreskin and you can like


---------55:27----------
the penis has difficulty like expanding


---------55:30----------
out as it fills with blood so what this


---------55:32----------
basically results in is like painful


---------55:33----------
erections


---------55:37----------
so formosus thankfully is like quite


---------55:39----------
rare


---------55:40----------
usually involves like some kind of


---------55:41----------
scarring or accident


---------55:43----------
with the foreskin where it develops scar


---------55:45----------
tissue so it's not as flexible as it


---------55:47----------
used to be


---------55:48----------
but like


---------55:49----------
can


---------55:50----------
result in a lot of you know shame and


---------55:52----------
like oh my god like i can't get an erect


---------55:54----------
or my penis is small or like it hurts so


---------55:57----------
much every time i get erect so i you


---------55:58----------
know i have to stay away from women and


---------56:00----------
like or men or you know


---------56:03----------
um so that's


---------56:05----------
you know phimosis is just an example of


---------56:06----------
like a rare condition the reason i bring


---------56:08----------
it up is simply because there are like


---------56:10----------
biological reasons like if something


---------56:12----------
involving


---------56:13----------
your sexual organs feels very very


---------56:16----------
uncomfortable to you or painful like go


---------56:18----------
see a doctor right because you could be


---------56:20----------
one of the few unlucky people that has


---------56:22----------
phimosis what's a little bit more common


---------56:24----------
is vaginismus


---------56:26----------
and this is a spasm


---------56:30----------
of


---------56:31----------
essentially like the outer muscles


---------56:35----------
of the vagina


---------56:38----------
so what that means is like when you have


---------56:40----------
a muscle spasm so remember that you know


---------56:42----------
the outside of the vagina has lots of


---------56:44----------
muscles and so when they spasm and


---------56:46----------
contract


---------56:48----------
it like they they contract and like


---------56:50----------
nothing can enter


---------56:51----------
so a lot of times what will happen is


---------56:53----------
you'll get you know a lot of contraction


---------56:55----------
and spasm


---------56:57----------
which means that anything that if you


---------56:58----------
try to have penetrative sex you're going


---------57:00----------
to get a ton of pain


---------57:02----------
and then like the the problem with


---------57:03----------
vaginismus is that there appear to be


---------57:05----------
there are different kinds of treatments


---------57:06----------
for it so you can you can do things like


---------57:09----------
uh vaginal dilators


---------57:13----------
also things like psychotherapy can be


---------57:15----------
effective


---------57:16----------
so we know that like vaginismus does


---------57:18----------
have a mental component sometimes you'll


---------57:20----------
have people with a history of trauma who


---------57:22----------
develop vaginismus


---------57:25----------
and so vaginal dilators are like you


---------57:27----------
know using these particular devices that


---------57:29----------
will slowly allow


---------57:31----------
the the spasm to kind of relax


---------57:34----------
so it takes a lot of time and effort but


---------57:35----------
this too leads to a lot of you know


---------57:37----------
shame


---------57:39----------
self-worth issues


---------57:41----------
like leads to a lot of relationship


---------57:43----------
problems because the woman doesn't know


---------57:44----------
what's wrong with her like it just hurts


---------57:46----------
a lot every time she has sex and she


---------57:48----------
loves this person and she wants to have


---------57:49----------
a relationship with them the dude is


---------57:51----------
kind of like doesn't know what to do


---------57:52----------
about it they're kind of confused people


---------57:54----------
will try lube because they're like okay


---------57:56----------
maybe it's an issue of lube so the point


---------57:58----------
here is that if you're having pain or


---------58:00----------
discomfort during sexual intercourse you


---------58:02----------
should go see a medical professional


---------58:03----------
because it's not that you're


---------58:04----------
fundamentally busted or broken or


---------58:06----------
whatever


---------58:07----------
it's it's just that you know like there


---------58:09----------
may be actually something medical going


---------58:10----------
on


---------58:12----------
um


---------58:14----------
so other conditions that you know cause


---------58:16----------
pain this isn't really related to to sex


---------58:18----------
directly but endometriosis i'm just kind


---------58:21----------
of including


---------58:23----------
so some women will have endometriosis


---------58:26----------
which is


---------58:27----------
the presence of this uterine tissue


---------58:31----------
do you remember this uterine tissue over


---------58:32----------
here


---------58:36----------
in places outside of the uterus so


---------58:38----------
sometimes you'll get a spot


---------58:40----------
of


---------58:41----------
uh uterine tissue here sometimes you can


---------58:44----------
even get it in the abdomen so you can


---------58:45----------
get it like outside of the uterus


---------58:48----------
and then what happens is when you go


---------58:49----------
through the necrotic


---------58:51----------
phase of menstruation


---------58:54----------
this stuff because remember this is all


---------58:56----------
mediated by hormones right and hormones


---------58:57----------
travel all over your body so you get all


---------58:59----------
these spots of uterine tissue that start


---------59:01----------
dying like all over your abdomen it's


---------59:03----------
incredibly incredibly painful


---------59:05----------
and so like some women are just really


---------59:07----------
really surprised by like how bad


---------59:09----------
menstruation is like they're in tons of


---------59:10----------
pain it feels like the pain is even like


---------59:13----------
outside of the uterine area and so


---------59:15----------
endometriosis is a very very unfortunate


---------59:17----------
condition that causes like a lot of pain


---------59:19----------
so people are also asking about


---------59:22----------
you know menstrual cycles and mental


---------59:24----------
health there are lots of good


---------59:25----------
correlations there their patients that


---------59:27----------
i've had that starting them on birth


---------59:29----------
control is like helps their depression


---------59:32----------
so i'll use birth control as an


---------59:33----------
adjunctive medication to treat their


---------59:35----------
depression because there are mood


---------59:36----------
fluctuations with all these hormonal


---------59:38----------
fluctuations other things that i'll do


---------59:40----------
with people who have really really bad


---------59:41----------
pmdd which is pre-menstrual dysphoric


---------59:44----------
disorder um or not necessarily pmdd but


---------59:48----------
you know who have like menstrual like


---------59:49----------
really really bad periods and really


---------59:51----------
really bad moods sometimes i'll actually


---------59:52----------
send them for an endometriosis


---------59:54----------
evaluation because sometimes the reason


---------59:56----------
that your mood is so damn bad is because


---------59:57----------
like there are parts of your body that


---------59:59----------
are dying like scattered throughout your


---------60:00----------
abdomen and it just hurts like hell and


---------60:02----------
so you're like you're cranky and you


---------60:03----------
don't feel like doing anything and you


---------60:05----------
kind of get sad and depressed and you


---------60:06----------
even get a little bit of the ptsd so


---------60:08----------
that next month rolls around you're like


---------60:09----------
oh my god it's gonna happen again and it


---------60:11----------
happens again and again and again and


---------60:12----------
again and again and again and again


---------60:14----------
and so like endometriosis i kind of


---------60:16----------
include it for the sake of completeness


---------60:17----------
it's not really like a sexual problem


---------60:19----------
it's not really related to sex i just


---------60:21----------
include it as like something that


---------60:23----------
happens to people that's relatively


---------60:24----------
common that can affect your mood can


---------60:26----------
affect a lot of stuff around


---------60:27----------
menstruation and you're you know you


---------60:29----------
feel like having sex or don't feel like


---------60:30----------
having sex


---------60:32----------
kind of a psa


---------60:33----------
um other conditions that you know people


---------60:35----------
will kind of mention this is sort of a


---------60:37----------
random smattering so it's not like i've


---------60:38----------
picked the most common


---------60:40----------
so hypoestrogenism


---------60:45----------
um is a good example of something that


---------60:46----------
leads to like vaginal dryness


---------60:52----------
so this is like another thing that's


---------60:53----------
filled with lots of shame and self-worth


---------60:55----------
issues is that some women


---------60:57----------
have either a low level of estrogen or


---------60:59----------
low response to estrogen in the vaginal


---------61:02----------
tissue which results in dryness if


---------61:04----------
there's dryness there can be pain during


---------61:06----------
intercourse so you know treatment for


---------61:08----------
this is just things like using


---------61:09----------
lubricants


---------61:11----------
um sometimes even starting birth control


---------61:13----------
can help


---------61:16----------
right


---------61:17----------
and so there's just a lot of things out


---------61:19----------
there that can make


---------61:21----------
sex painful or uncomfortable and as long


---------61:24----------
as we know because what tends to happen


---------61:26----------
like psychologically let's just talk


---------61:28----------
about this for a second if you don't


---------61:29----------
know about any of this stuff


---------61:32----------
and


---------61:33----------
you just hear that sex is amazing and


---------61:35----------
everyone's getting laid on tinder and


---------61:36----------
whatnot and like people romanticize that


---------61:38----------
in movies and tv shows and if you're


---------61:40----------
netflix producer you sprinkle in random


---------61:42----------
sexual scenes in places that they don't


---------61:44----------
belong for i don't understand why but


---------61:46----------
whatever


---------61:48----------
um


---------61:49----------
and and then like what happens is like


---------61:50----------
there's there's a societal perception of


---------61:53----------
what you know what sex is supposed to be


---------61:55----------
like


---------61:57----------
and and so like if you don't live up to


---------61:59----------
that societal perception it results in


---------62:01----------
like lots of shame because you're like


---------62:02----------
i'm kind of screwed up right so other


---------62:04----------
good examples of that are like you know


---------62:06----------
things like penis size


---------62:08----------
where


---------62:09----------
you know a lot of people are concerned


---------62:10----------
about the size of their penis


---------62:12----------
um even i've unfortunately made fun of


---------62:14----------
people with micro penis in the past it's


---------62:15----------
something that i regret


---------62:17----------
and the truth is like i don't know if


---------62:18----------
you guys know this but there are these


---------62:20----------
people called lesbians and they're able


---------62:22----------
to have healthy sexual lives and they


---------62:24----------
actually don't even have penises at all


---------62:25----------
they have like the tiniest penises on


---------62:27----------
the planet and they actually do fine


---------62:30----------
and so it turns out that like you know


---------62:32----------
penis size is actually like not that


---------62:34----------
important


---------62:35----------
um so even if people you know there's a


---------62:37----------
lot of stuff involving shame and


---------62:38----------
self-worth and people like feeling like


---------62:40----------
their body isn't good enough and it


---------62:42----------
turns out that having a healthy sexual


---------62:43----------
relationship


---------62:45----------
is


---------62:46----------
you know it's just about really


---------62:47----------
understanding like yourself


---------62:48----------
understanding your body understanding


---------62:50----------
your partner it doesn't come down to


---------62:52----------
you know the size of your penis or any


---------62:54----------
other like arbitrary characteristic


---------62:56----------
so just keep that in mind


---------62:59----------
okay the last thing that we're going to


---------63:00----------
cover today


---------63:02----------
um


---------63:03----------
is just like a couple of


---------63:06----------
surprisingly common sexual problems so


---------63:08----------
we're going to talk about premature


---------63:09----------
ejaculation


---------63:17----------
and death grip syndrome


---------63:22----------
this one


---------63:23----------
is an actual medical thing


---------63:29----------
this one is something that dr k made up


---------63:32----------
but i see way too much


---------63:35----------
okay so let's talk about this


---------63:37----------
so premature ejaculation is when people


---------63:39----------
ejaculate very quickly


---------63:41----------
at the end of the day there are a lot of


---------63:42----------
different things that you can do there's


---------63:43----------
a lot of you know shame associated with


---------63:46----------
premature ejaculation as well


---------63:49----------
there are treatments for it so oddly


---------63:50----------
enough you can start people on ssris for


---------63:52----------
uh premature ejaculation so one of the


---------63:56----------
side effects of ssris which are


---------63:58----------
antidepressant or anti-anxiety


---------63:59----------
medication


---------64:00----------
is that like they make it harder for you


---------64:02----------
to climax so sometimes you can even use


---------64:05----------
this with people who prematurely


---------64:06----------
ejaculate if they start an ssri like


---------64:08----------
they can essentially last longer


---------64:10----------
other things that you can do is you can


---------64:12----------
you know wear a condom so that reduces


---------64:13----------
the amount of feeling you have and


---------64:15----------
things like that


---------64:16----------
there's just other just like general


---------64:18----------
things that you can do for premature


---------64:19----------
ejaculation you can use mental


---------64:20----------
distraction i know it's kind of weird


---------64:24----------
but you can think about video games


---------64:26----------
while having sex and that'll actually


---------64:28----------
like help you last longer because your


---------64:30----------
mind won't be so into the sex


---------64:33----------
um it's difficult to do but it does work


---------64:36----------
and then there are other things that you


---------64:37----------
can do just as you start to have sex on


---------64:39----------
a more regular basis as you get to know


---------64:41----------
your partner oftentimes premature


---------64:43----------
ejaculation will actually i i swear guys


---------64:47----------
i'm not trolling you i'm serious so


---------64:49----------
there's actually like you can use mental


---------64:51----------
distraction and think about non-sexual


---------64:53----------
things right because if we think about


---------64:54----------
the process of arousal and ejaculation


---------64:57----------
and climax


---------64:58----------
like arousal is a huge part of it right


---------65:00----------
you don't just walk around ejaculating


---------65:06----------
right like i realized that some of y'all


---------65:08----------
are gonna punish me for saying that but


---------65:10----------
it's true


---------65:11----------
so the the truth is


---------65:14----------
[ __ ] me


---------65:16----------
such a bad


---------65:19----------
so the truth is that arousal has a lot


---------65:22----------
to do with reaching climax and so you


---------65:24----------
can use mental distraction


---------65:26----------
to reduce your internal state of arousal


---------65:29----------
and will allow you to ejaculate later


---------65:34----------
interestingly enough they're also like


---------65:35----------
techniques of tantric meditation


---------65:39----------
which we can talk about in a second


---------65:41----------
that also can help people with premature


---------65:43----------
ejaculation


---------65:45----------
uh other things that you can do for


---------65:46----------
premature ejaculation i know it's kind


---------65:48----------
of weird but i've seen a lot of


---------65:49----------
self-resolution


---------65:51----------
in committed relationships


---------65:53----------
so just like slowing things down and


---------65:56----------
almost like training yourself so like


---------65:58----------
training yourself with your partner as


---------65:59----------
you get close kind of slowing down


---------66:02----------
taking a step back like restarting like


---------66:04----------
you can just sort of like retrain


---------66:06----------
kind of behaviorally like your body's


---------66:08----------
response like almost in a biofeedback


---------66:10----------
way


---------66:11----------
if with kind of time and effort and


---------66:13----------
dedication


---------66:14----------
death grip syndrome is something else


---------66:17----------
entirely and this is where


---------66:19----------
um when people masturbate for a long


---------66:21----------
period i'm talking about men so when


---------66:22----------
they masturbate for long periods of time


---------66:25----------
especially without lube


---------66:28----------
and you know using


---------66:30----------
hand and like for years and years and


---------66:32----------
years what happens is you can also like


---------66:35----------
train your nerves to respond to a


---------66:37----------
particular kind of


---------66:39----------
um


---------66:40----------
stimulation to reach climax


---------66:43----------
and so when it's kind of bizarre but


---------66:45----------
some people who like let's say you like


---------66:46----------
you've never had sex and you've been


---------66:48----------
masturbating for 10 to 15 years and then


---------66:50----------
you have intercourse for the first time


---------66:51----------
and the sensations provided by


---------66:54----------
intercourse are actually quite different


---------66:56----------
from what your body has gotten used to


---------66:59----------
so you know the the the lubrication and


---------67:02----------
the pressure and things like that it


---------67:05----------
tends to be a little bit less than what


---------67:06----------
you can do with your the lubrication is


---------67:08----------
greater and the pressure can be less


---------67:10----------
which results in a different physical


---------67:12----------
uh sensation which results in a


---------67:14----------
difficulty to attain climax through


---------67:16----------
sexual intercourse


---------67:18----------
this too can be sort of fixed through


---------67:20----------
training


---------67:22----------
so the first thing is that you know


---------67:23----------
using lube


---------67:24----------
and a lighter grip


---------67:27----------
it's gonna feel kind of weird because a


---------67:29----------
lot of people that you


---------67:30----------
you know who go through this experience


---------67:32----------
will like it kind of feels unsatisfying


---------67:35----------
to masturbate in that way but like you


---------67:37----------
kind of gotta do that or you can start


---------67:38----------
to have more sex and then your body will


---------67:40----------
reacclimatize


---------67:42----------
aren't these a solution to one another


---------67:44----------
sort of right so they're kind of like


---------67:45----------
opposites


---------67:48----------
um


---------67:50----------
all right so that's kind of like just a


---------67:52----------
couple of random other things so this


---------67:54----------
this lecture is by no means complete


---------67:56----------
but when it comes to you know people


---------67:58----------
that come into my office and we try to


---------68:00----------
talk about safe sex we haven't really


---------68:02----------
talked about consent really at all which


---------68:04----------
i i think maybe is just a whole other


---------68:05----------
lecture because we've been at this for


---------68:07----------
over an hour and 15 minutes now


---------68:09----------
um


---------68:10----------
but


---------68:11----------
the the goal is is really to just share


---------68:13----------
with you all some like basic information


---------68:15----------
about like sexual education


---------68:17----------
it's not to be meme-ish which i know we


---------68:19----------
did but


---------68:21----------
it's really just to empower yourselves


---------68:23----------
to understand a couple of basic things


---------68:24----------
one is like what does safe sex mean


---------68:27----------
from an sti perspective from a pregnancy


---------68:29----------
perspective


---------68:30----------
second is


---------68:32----------
uh you know what are some common


---------68:34----------
problems that people will run across and


---------68:36----------
the main message there is not for you


---------68:38----------
guys to self-diagnose


---------68:39----------
you know is not to diagnose yourself


---------68:41----------
with these things but to recognize that


---------68:43----------
if you have any kind of pain any kind of


---------68:45----------
discomfort if something about your


---------68:47----------
understanding your perception of what


---------68:49----------
sex should be like


---------68:50----------
is you have a perception of sex and you


---------68:52----------
have like an actual experience of sex


---------68:54----------
and those don't line up one of the first


---------68:56----------
things you should do is go see a medical


---------68:57----------
professional because it turns out that


---------68:59----------
there's all kinds of stuff


---------69:00----------
from vaginal spasm


---------69:03----------
to you know premature ejaculation to


---------69:06----------
hypoestrogenism


---------69:08----------
um to phimosis there's like all kinds of


---------69:10----------
stuff like this is by no means a


---------69:11----------
complete list right so they're like


---------69:13----------
they're actual doctors who will train


---------69:15----------
for four years to become you know


---------69:18----------
ob gyns so obstetrics and gynecology and


---------69:21----------
this is what they specialize in so they


---------69:23----------
like you know they understand everything


---------69:24----------
about


---------69:25----------
gynecology getting pregnant the


---------69:27----------
complications of pregnancy birth control


---------69:29----------
all that kind of stuff so i'm a


---------69:30----------
psychiatrist it's not like actually my


---------69:32----------
area of expertise


---------69:34----------
and so you know determining what the


---------69:36----------
right move is for you like involves


---------69:38----------
first of all getting a good diagnostic


---------69:40----------
evaluation if you're running into any of


---------69:41----------
these problems


---------69:43----------
second thing is to you know make the


---------69:45----------
right choice for you in terms of birth


---------69:47----------
control and like safe sexual habits and


---------69:49----------
stuff like that which is also highly


---------69:51----------
individualized i sort of mentioned adhd


---------69:54----------
there are other things that are really


---------69:55----------
important to know so for example birth


---------69:57----------
control pills have a high


---------70:00----------
increase your risk of having stroke and


---------70:02----------
ischemic


---------70:03----------
problems like ischemic strokes and


---------70:05----------
things like that and clots


---------70:06----------
so basically like they make your blood


---------70:08----------
more likely to clot and so if you have a


---------70:10----------
clot in a blood vessel in your brain


---------70:12----------
you're going to have a stroke so a


---------70:13----------
stroke stroke is when a portion of your


---------70:15----------
brain doesn't receive enough blood and


---------70:17----------
then actually dies


---------70:19----------
so


---------70:19----------
you know


---------70:20----------
uh birth control pills increase your


---------70:22----------
risk of stroke so they're not really


---------70:24----------
recommended in people over 35


---------70:27----------
they are also compound with cigarette


---------70:29----------
smoking so if you smoke cigarettes and


---------70:31----------
you're on birth control pills


---------70:32----------
they will like drastically increase your


---------70:35----------
risk of stroke


---------70:37----------
there are also other like details which


---------70:38----------
we kind of didn't go into here for


---------70:40----------
example like birth control pills tend to


---------70:42----------
be dosed based in a particular weight


---------70:44----------
range so if you're outside of that


---------70:46----------
weight range the birth control may not


---------70:48----------
be as effective which means that your


---------70:50----------
your likelihood of getting pregnant


---------70:51----------
could actually increase depending on


---------70:53----------
your weight so there are all these


---------70:55----------
different medical complications or not


---------70:58----------
not complications in terms of bad things


---------70:59----------
but the the medical decision making is


---------71:01----------
quite complicated which is why you all


---------71:03----------
should go see a doctor about it okay


---------71:14----------
you
