---------00:00----------
so we have hid miraculously like eight


---------00:03----------
weeks after we started streaming okay so


---------00:07----------
guys like this this we have to talk


---------00:09----------
about actually so I just want to say


---------00:13----------
first of all thank you guys very much I


---------00:14----------
forgot about this


---------00:15----------
so we've hit like 100,000 followers on


---------00:18----------
Twitter like eight weeks or 10 weeks


---------00:20----------
after we started stream like we started


---------00:21----------
streaming in September or October or


---------00:24----------
something and so it's been like three to


---------00:26----------
four months and our stream really picked


---------00:28----------
up about two months ago


---------00:30----------
so we've hit already a hundred thousand


---------00:32----------
followers on Twitch and a hundred


---------00:33----------
thousand subscribers on YouTube which is


---------00:35----------
amazing and so like I think that we so


---------00:42----------
just so you guys know so healthy gamer


---------00:43----------
has been around for a little over a year


---------00:45----------
and we've been like sort of a volunteer


---------00:47----------
kind of project so we've got five people


---------00:49----------
that have been volunteering and we


---------00:52----------
started with you know in over the course


---------00:55----------
of maybe 2000 the first eight months of


---------00:58----------
2019 we got a hundred subscribers on


---------01:01----------
YouTube and we had an average of like 20


---------01:03----------
to 30 viewers on Twitch and so and we've


---------01:10----------
grown a lot since then so first of all I


---------01:12----------
want to thank you guys for showing up


---------01:13----------
subscribing supporting us


---------01:15----------
we're number 135 on the fastest growing


---------01:20----------
English twitch streamers over the last


---------01:22----------
180 days and number 47 in the last 90 so


---------01:26----------
that's been just absolutely crazy so


---------01:28----------
like our growth has been awesome and


---------01:30----------
I've been really grateful for it because


---------01:32----------
now you know we've got a team of people


---------01:34----------
that are helping us like produce more


---------01:38----------
content and like making other kinds of


---------01:39----------
content that may not be related to


---------01:41----------
YouTube it's been just an incredible and


---------01:43----------
unbelievable experience


---------01:45----------
so a couple of other things so healthy


---------01:51----------
gamer has been so we kind of started the


---------01:54----------
twitch stuff around 2019 but we actually


---------01:56----------
started our original alpha group back in


---------01:59----------
2018 and what I had done is is started


---------02:03----------
with this was sort of after the reddit


---------02:05----------
AMA I don't know if you guys saw this


---------02:06----------
back in 2018 but I did an AMA about


---------02:09----------
video game addiction and so I had a


---------02:10----------
group of about 15 people that reached


---------02:12----------
out to me and we actually started


---------02:14----------
running a group so every week I spent


---------02:17----------
one hour with like the same group of


---------02:18----------
people and we would talk about video


---------02:20----------
game addiction we would talk about our


---------02:21----------
lives and we talk about our minds we


---------02:23----------
would talk about meditation and I worked


---------02:25----------
with people every week over the course


---------02:26----------
of a year and that was like our alpha


---------02:28----------
group and so that group went really well


---------02:33----------
people I think really did a phenomenal


---------02:35----------
job some of the volunteers that have


---------02:37----------
actually joined healthy gamer came out


---------02:38----------
of that group and so it was a lot of fun


---------02:40----------
to kind of work with people


---------02:41----------
longitudinally and then we realized that


---------02:44----------
like over time you know so what I was


---------02:48----------
working with people presumably this was


---------02:51----------
a group about video game addiction but


---------02:53----------
over time we began to realize that like


---------02:55----------
it's not really just about being


---------02:57----------
addicted to the game it's that people


---------02:59----------
don't understand like mental health that


---------03:01----------
mental health the face of mental health


---------03:03----------
is changing right so like the needs and


---------03:05----------
pressures that are on our minds have


---------03:08----------
changed because of things like social


---------03:10----------
media because of things like being


---------03:12----------
unable to escape bullies like when I was


---------03:14----------
in school you know I would get bullied


---------03:15----------
in school and then I would go home and


---------03:17----------
then I wouldn't see the bully anymore


---------03:18----------
but now thanks to social media and


---------03:21----------
Instagram and Twitter and things like


---------03:23----------
that bullying is like 24/7 and so we


---------03:26----------
need a new perspective on mental health


---------03:28----------
like the kinds of challenges that people


---------03:30----------
are facing gamers and also non gamers


---------03:32----------
because I guess a bunch of non gamers


---------03:34----------
are watching our stream now which is


---------03:36----------
bizarre so I recently got a message from


---------03:38----------
someone in India who is like not a gamer


---------03:41----------
at all but has started watching our


---------03:42----------
streams and so we've just we're


---------03:45----------
spreading really wide


---------03:47----------
and so so this this stream has really


---------03:52----------
evolved into really helping people


---------03:53----------
understand like evolving issues and


---------03:56----------
nuances around mental health that I


---------03:59----------
don't think that a psychiatric model is


---------04:01----------
sufficient anymore right so it's not


---------04:03----------
just about getting diagnosed with


---------04:05----------
depression and taking an antidepressant


---------04:06----------
like that's not going to fix your life


---------04:09----------
so we as we sort of grew and as I began


---------04:14----------
to realize that we you know wanted to


---------04:16----------
like reach a broader audience and that


---------04:18----------
what we were talking about was really


---------04:19----------
important we turned to twitch and and so


---------04:24----------
we started streaming which is insane so


---------04:27----------
I got a lot of feedback for many of my


---------04:29----------
colleagues that this is crazy you can't


---------04:30----------
be a psychiatrist or doctor and like


---------04:32----------
start talking to people on the internet


---------04:33----------
and so yeah so I think that that was you


---------04:39----------
know so we tried an experiment I think


---------04:41----------
Devin Nash was instrumental actually in


---------04:43----------
getting us off the ground and helping us


---------04:45----------
develop a stream and things like that so


---------04:48----------
huge thanks to Devin if you guys don't


---------04:50----------
know who Devin is he's been in the


---------04:51----------
eSports industry for many many years and


---------04:54----------
produces actually a lot of content that


---------04:56----------
I have found more and more interesting


---------04:58----------
as I've gotten into streaming so he


---------05:00----------
talks a lot about the scene the industry


---------05:02----------
a lot about kind of streaming he runs a


---------05:05----------
talent agency and Devin was amazing in


---------05:08----------
supportive and I sort of began to


---------05:09----------
realize or like he helped me realize


---------05:11----------
that like we can actually reach a lot of


---------05:12----------
people through twitch streaming and so I


---------05:16----------
think another thing that I kind of want


---------05:18----------
to comment on is like that sort of


---------05:20----------
started our journey and we've gotten so


---------05:21----------
much help from a ton of people in terms


---------05:25----------
of like advice like domination time has


---------05:28----------
been awesome in terms of helping us like


---------05:29----------
he told me like what to order in terms


---------05:32----------
of you know how to set up microphones


---------05:33----------
and things like that and as we've talked


---------05:36----------
to more and more streamers like the


---------05:38----------
spread of our AoE has increased and


---------05:40----------
that's been awesome so like other


---------05:43----------
streamers that I just want to thank for


---------05:45----------
sort of helping us understand twitch and


---------05:47----------
helping us grow destiny Athene and shout


---------05:51----------
outs to like lily Pichu reckful Skye


---------05:54----------
Williams Mitch Jones Bobbi


---------05:57----------
Ethan Evans these people have been just


---------05:59----------
incredibly


---------06:00----------
amazing and brave for coming on and then


---------06:03----------
also like all of the people who aren't


---------06:05----------
streamers right so whether it starts


---------06:07----------
with people like madame Fey or donut


---------06:10----------
muncher or boole's


---------06:13----------
all of these people crus if I mean there


---------06:17----------
have been so many people have been


---------06:18----------
willing to come on everyone who came on


---------06:19----------
for of all things the porn addiction


---------06:21----------
stream and and you know it this stream


---------06:24----------
has been built off of y'all so I think


---------06:27----------
that a lot of people think that healthy


---------06:28----------
gamer is about dr. K but it's not


---------06:31----------
actually about me like I don't I don't


---------06:33----------
know how else to say that so you guys


---------06:35----------
realize that like you know I'm basically


---------06:37----------
a facilitator but all of the things like


---------06:41----------
the AoE healing actually comes from the


---------06:44----------
people who come on stream like you guys


---------06:45----------
get this like this is important to


---------06:47----------
understand I'm not actually healing


---------06:49----------
anyone right it's the people who are


---------06:51----------
coming on and sharing their struggles


---------06:53----------
the people who are being courageous and


---------06:55----------
offering themselves up in terms of their


---------06:59----------
mind and what they struggle with and as


---------07:01----------
they like work through that stuff that's


---------07:04----------
what's helpful for people right so it's


---------07:06----------
not me like I don't you guys are not


---------07:08----------
resonating with me you guys are


---------07:10----------
resonating with the people who come on


---------07:13----------
stream and so I think that that like


---------07:19----------
huge huge thanks to everyone who has


---------07:21----------
come on stream everyone who has


---------07:22----------
volunteered to come on stream all of the


---------07:24----------
people who have helped us get to where


---------07:26----------
we are people who edit our YouTube and


---------07:28----------
people who even like comment and stuff


---------07:29----------
on YouTube like that's huge people who


---------07:32----------
you know posts on our subreddit and and


---------07:35----------
like hang out on our discord like our


---------07:36----------
discord is like an amazing place now and


---------07:39----------
so like I want to stress this like more


---------07:42----------
and more and more that healthy gamers


---------07:43----------
like really not about me it's not it's


---------07:46----------
about you guys and y'all are the ones


---------07:47----------
that are really making this happen and


---------07:49----------
whether your support is by watching


---------07:51----------
whether it's by subscribing or donating


---------07:53----------
or anything like that whether it's


---------07:54----------
hanging out on discord whether it's


---------07:56----------
posting on on reddit like wherever it is


---------07:58----------
wherever you guys like you guys are


---------08:00----------
building this that's what a healthy game


---------08:01----------
was really about and so I think a couple


---------08:05----------
of other things it's been an interesting


---------08:06----------
journey so the funny thing that started


---------08:09----------
to happen is when we talk about


---------08:11----------
streamers like when I talk to streamers


---------08:13----------
they sort of


---------08:14----------
about the feeling of needing to perform


---------08:16----------
and I also sort of felt that struggle


---------08:18----------
personally so I started like noticing


---------08:21----------
that my viewercount started mattering to


---------08:24----------
me and I would check my viewer account


---------08:26----------
and I would check like I would just log


---------08:27----------
on at random times to see like how many


---------08:29----------
followers we have on Twitch and I


---------08:31----------
started to like feel this pull towards


---------08:33----------
like wanting to be bigger and I think


---------08:36----------
that that's really dangerous and I


---------08:39----------
actually don't I mean do I want to grow


---------08:41----------
absolutely but I don't think that this


---------08:43----------
is about the growth of our stream right


---------08:46----------
like that's not actually what we should


---------08:48----------
care about and what I it's not what I


---------08:50----------
want to care about I think we've got to


---------08:52----------
remember that healthy gamer is actually


---------08:53----------
not about how big we are not about how


---------08:55----------
successful we are it's really about you


---------08:58----------
guys so healthy gamer is about the


---------09:00----------
individual person that each stream you


---------09:05----------
know we talk to you like it's about that


---------09:06----------
person and it's about you guys for


---------09:08----------
watching and so you know the goal of


---------09:12----------
this and I hope we really straight to


---------09:14----------
stay true to our mission and don't sell


---------09:16----------
out and all that good stuff is


---------09:17----------
ultimately to help you and it's to help


---------09:19----------
the people who come on it's to help the


---------09:21----------
people who are part of our community


---------09:22----------
like that's what we're really about it's


---------09:24----------
not about growth it's not about money


---------09:25----------
it's not about subs I mean all that


---------09:27----------
stuff is really helpful and helps us


---------09:29----------
grow so I'm grateful for that but at the


---------09:31----------
end of the day like we got into this to


---------09:34----------
help you guys understand how you work as


---------09:37----------
human beings and how to be like more


---------09:39----------
successful and be healthier and happier


---------09:41----------
in life if you're held back by


---------09:43----------
depression if you're held back by a lack


---------09:45----------
of motivation if you're a NEET right so


---------09:48----------
not an education employment or training


---------09:50----------
if you're you know a gamer and ER addict


---------09:53----------
if you spend ten hours a day at home


---------09:55----------
like it doesn't all of those things are


---------09:58----------
completely fine and we're here to help


---------10:00----------
you right or help be here to help you


---------10:02----------
kind of come out of that so a couple of


---------10:04----------
other things so since we're growing so


---------10:08----------
much I was talking a little bit about


---------10:10----------
the coaching program so it's my hope


---------10:12----------
that I can offer support because there's


---------10:15----------
just no way like so over the last month


---------10:17----------
I've gotten 2,000 dm's emails messages


---------10:21----------
on reddit all this kind of stuff for


---------10:23----------
people like voicemails things like that


---------10:25----------
I just got


---------10:27----------
call actually I got an email from the


---------10:30----------
page operator at my hospital that my


---------10:33----------
voice box is full because people are


---------10:35----------
somehow like paging me or calling me or


---------10:38----------
trying to contact me through my Hospital


---------10:39----------
don't do that by the way because I'm not


---------10:42----------
gonna get that message so you know we're


---------10:46----------
growing a lot and I think this isn't so


---------10:48----------
now the challenge becomes like how do we


---------10:49----------
help you guys more so this is something


---------10:52----------
that I definitely want to hear from you


---------10:54----------
guys about so like I want y'all to


---------10:59----------
understand that I I am I am a resource


---------11:03----------
right so that's the way that I view


---------11:05----------
myself so I want to know what can I do


---------11:10----------
to help you more and so a lot of people


---------11:12----------
have messaged me like I only have 24


---------11:14----------
hours in a day you know eight of those I


---------11:16----------
try to sleep and then two to three of


---------11:18----------
those I try to spend with my family and


---------11:19----------
like those are important to me I have to


---------11:21----------
you know I have a job and stuff so I


---------11:23----------
have to spend like you know I spent


---------11:24----------
about six to eight hours a day working


---------11:27----------
usually and then I spend like two to


---------11:29----------
four hours a day on healthy gamer and so


---------11:32----------
what I want to know is like how can I


---------11:33----------
help more and this is a question that I


---------11:36----------
have for you guys so you guys need to


---------11:37----------
tell me what you want me to do like do


---------11:39----------
you want me to stream or do you want me


---------11:41----------
to make more longitudinal content do you


---------11:42----------
want me to train coaches and all that


---------11:46----------
kind of stuff so and this is something


---------11:48----------
that thankfully you guys have been


---------11:50----------
awesome about so people have told me


---------11:52----------
like what they want right so here's what


---------11:54----------
and so this is what healthy gamer is


---------11:55----------
working on so we're at a hundred


---------11:57----------
thousand followers and subscribers thank


---------11:59----------
you guys very much for everyone who has


---------12:01----------
subscribed and donated and stuff like


---------12:02----------
that here's what we're gonna do with


---------12:04----------
that okay so the first thing that we're


---------12:07----------
gonna do is train coaches because I've


---------12:09----------
realized that like I don't think that


---------12:11----------
any amount of watching twitch and


---------12:12----------
YouTube is a substitute I can get on


---------12:15----------
here and talk to you know I can talk


---------12:17----------
about how the mind works how the brain


---------12:18----------
works how spirituality works I can talk


---------12:20----------
about addiction and I'm gonna do all


---------12:22----------
those things I can interview people and


---------12:24----------
that's part of the AoE healing but I


---------12:25----------
think there's no substitute for if we're


---------12:28----------
really talking about like what


---------12:29----------
scientifically constitutes change in


---------12:32----------
someone's life it's working with someone


---------12:35----------
right so what we want to do is like


---------12:37----------
change the way that people get support


---------12:40----------
so mental health right now is too


---------12:42----------
expensive too old and too slow what do I


---------12:45----------
mean by that so like if you guys want to


---------12:46----------
see a therapist


---------12:47----------
you know those appointments run anywhere


---------12:49----------
from like 125 to like 500 per


---------12:53----------
appointment right insurance will cover a


---------12:55----------
portion of that things like that


---------12:56----------
sometimes insurance is expensive


---------12:58----------
sometimes insurance is crappy it's it's


---------13:00----------
too slow so like getting an appointment


---------13:02----------
with a therapist can take time so I


---------13:04----------
still think you guys should try to do


---------13:06----------
all of those things if you do have a


---------13:08----------
mental health problem you should see a


---------13:10----------
clinician so our coaching program is not


---------13:12----------
a substitute for mental health treatment


---------13:13----------
it's not designed to diagnose or treat


---------13:15----------
anything but it is designed to support


---------13:19----------
you and this is where there's actually


---------13:21----------
some really interesting research that


---------13:22----------
shows that coaches are actually very


---------13:24----------
effective is a group of people it's sort


---------13:27----------
of helping people and so we're gonna


---------13:29----------
train coaches and the average age of


---------13:32----------
psychiatrist by the way in the u.s. is


---------13:33----------
like 54 or something like that so I


---------13:36----------
think the other challenge that I heard


---------13:37----------
from you guys is that like when you do


---------13:39----------
sometimes seek mental health treatment


---------13:41----------
they they may be able to handle the


---------13:43----------
depression but there are things about


---------13:44----------
your life that they don't understand and


---------13:47----------
so that's why we developed our coaching


---------13:49----------
program so our focus has really been on


---------13:51----------
the coaching program because like


---------13:53----------
ultimately I think that you guys you


---------13:55----------
know what I want to do is train people


---------13:56----------
who sort of follow my methodology and


---------13:58----------
are able to like help you guys


---------14:01----------
so we're also like trying to seek


---------14:03----------
sponsors sponsorship and stuff like that


---------14:05----------
because I know that you know a lot of


---------14:07----------
people don't have resources to pay for


---------14:09----------
this stuff so we're working on that kind


---------14:10----------
of stuff so the next thing that we're


---------14:13----------
working on is more longitudinal content


---------14:17----------
right so a lot of people have asked for


---------14:19----------
like more in-depth stuff about Ayurveda


---------14:21----------
about how do you find your Dharma how do


---------14:23----------
you understand addiction how do you


---------14:25----------
understand your brain can you put


---------14:27----------
together like a set of meditation


---------14:29----------
exercises like a meditation curriculum I


---------14:31----------
want to build all that stuff out it


---------14:33----------
doesn't seem like Twitch's necessarily


---------14:35----------
the best way to deliver that content so


---------14:37----------
we may like you know if we're thinking


---------14:38----------
about like a course like if you want to


---------14:39----------
learn meditation start to finish theory


---------14:42----------
different kinds of techniques new


---------14:43----------
techniques for insomnia techniques for


---------14:45----------
anxiety techniques for depression and


---------14:46----------
techniques for strengthening like you


---------14:48----------
physically strengthening use techniques


---------14:50----------
for enhancing your Chi or your prana


---------14:53----------
you know how can we sort of create a


---------14:55----------
longitudinal body of content like a


---------14:57----------
curriculum so that's the other big thing


---------15:00----------
that I want to focus on and then this is


---------15:02----------
something that my team keeps on telling


---------15:04----------
me not to talk about but I'm gonna talk


---------15:08----------
about it anyway and and so the other


---------15:10----------
thing that I want to do in my heart of


---------15:12----------
hearts is to like do like more retreats


---------15:13----------
so this we probably don't have the


---------15:15----------
bandwidth for and things like that but


---------15:16----------
ultimately we had a retreat in August of


---------15:18----------
2019 and people gamers from like all


---------15:22----------
over the US came and we want to do like


---------15:25----------
I want to do that again because


---------15:26----------
ultimately as much as AoE is important


---------15:29----------
as much as I love streaming on Twitch as


---------15:31----------
much as I love teaching you guys the


---------15:33----------
stuff and training coaches and stuff


---------15:34----------
like that the most of so I want to see


---------15:40----------
people in person I want to work with


---------15:41----------
people in person I want you guys to come


---------15:43----------
I want to help you I want to help you


---------15:45----------
like in a group I want to help you in


---------15:46----------
person I want to talk to you in person


---------15:47----------
and so okay [ __ ] ready great oh sorry


---------15:54----------
biscuit okay so all right let me just


---------15:58----------
kind of wrap up it's the last thing that


---------16:01----------
I wanted maybe not the last thing but


---------16:04----------
you know one of the things that I also


---------16:06----------
want to mention is this wouldn't be


---------16:07----------
possible without our mods so like this


---------16:09----------
is amazing like the coolest thing about


---------16:11----------
this whole experience has been our mods


---------16:13----------
so I don't know where you guys came from


---------16:15----------
I don't know how you became mods but


---------16:18----------
y'all are doing an awesome job and the


---------16:20----------
mods on our discord they like got


---------16:22----------
together themselves they're so much more


---------16:24----------
organized than we are actually they like


---------16:26----------
they're putting together a coding


---------16:28----------
workshop to help people like learn how


---------16:31----------
to code right so there are people in our


---------16:33----------
community that are starting to like help


---------16:35----------
other people acquire skills that will


---------16:38----------
like get them jobs and so that they can


---------16:40----------
earn money and be financially


---------16:41----------
independent and these mods just came out


---------16:44----------
of nowhere like I don't know where y'all


---------16:45----------
came from but y'all are amazing and I


---------16:47----------
sat in on a mod meeting which happens


---------16:49----------
every week there's like a mod meeting


---------16:50----------
that happens every week so I like asked


---------16:52----------
if I could come and see what they're up


---------16:53----------
to


---------16:53----------
they're so organized and they're so


---------16:55----------
awesome and there's so many times where


---------16:57----------
we've had guests who have actually


---------16:59----------
pretty toxic communities and they've


---------17:01----------
done a really really good job of like


---------17:03----------
keeping those talks of communities in


---------17:05----------
check and remember


---------17:06----------
that like this is a stream so you guys


---------17:09----------
like understand first of all it takes a


---------17:10----------
ton of courage to come on here and


---------17:12----------
secondly like sometimes twitch chat is


---------17:14----------
an [ __ ] like sometimes twitch chat is


---------17:17----------
like mean to people who show


---------17:19----------
vulnerability and weakness and they're


---------17:20----------
like hungry for blood and our mods have


---------17:23----------
been so awesome it's sort of shutting


---------17:25----------
that down and like creating a space


---------17:26----------
that's positive so like I get that I


---------17:29----------
mean I get it's fun I get it's kind of


---------17:31----------
you know important to be like I know


---------17:33----------
that a lot of people like that kind of


---------17:35----------
thing but this that's not what the


---------17:37----------
stream is about right like it's not


---------17:38----------
about laughing at other people it's


---------17:40----------
about learning from other people it's


---------17:41----------
about growing yourself and so I just


---------17:44----------
want to say a huge thank you to the mods


---------17:47----------
and yeah so like I guess there there are


---------17:52----------
other things like music stuff like


---------17:54----------
people are teaching other people how to


---------17:55----------
make music they're teaching people how


---------17:56----------
to code there's also like organic groups


---------17:59----------
that are happening within our discord


---------18:01----------
where people are like forming


---------18:02----------
accountability groups so those are like


---------18:04----------
these are like groups that are basically


---------18:06----------
like people are keeping each other and


---------18:07----------
check in terms of like exercise and


---------18:09----------
stuff like that and so huge like thank


---------18:13----------
you to that so and yeah so like I would


---------18:20----------
just want to emphasize this and then


---------18:21----------
we'll get to miss gif so healthy gamers


---------18:27----------
not about me right so I'm dr. kay but


---------18:30----------
it's not it's not dr. kay it's healthy


---------18:32----------
gamer it's about our staff it's about


---------18:34----------
our moderators it's about our coaches


---------18:36----------
it's about our community it's about the


---------18:38----------
people who hang out on discord it's


---------18:39----------
about people who are on YouTube and


---------18:41----------
reddit and twitch it's about you guys


---------18:43----------
like healthy gamer it's not dr. kay


---------18:45----------
stream it's healthy gamer stream and you


---------18:47----------
guys are the healthy gamers and I think


---------18:49----------
it's just what I think is just amazing


---------18:51----------
is that I live in a time where I have I


---------18:56----------
realize some time ago that like this is


---------18:59----------
not gonna work like I've spent I devoted


---------19:02----------
15 years of my life to understand how


---------19:04----------
people work and how to help them and


---------19:06----------
people come to my office every single


---------19:08----------
day not every day but you know five days


---------19:10----------
a week and I help them individually


---------19:13----------
and like that's not good enough there's


---------19:16----------
just no way there's no way that I can


---------19:19----------
help everyone who needs help so we need


---------19:22----------
like AoE in like twitch right discord


---------19:25----------
like I I don't I didn't live like this


---------19:28----------
isn't I'm not doing this 20 years ago I


---------19:29----------
20 years ago it was like I seek you if


---------19:31----------
you guys even know what that is right


---------19:33----------
it's like AOL Instant Messenger this


---------19:35----------
would not be possible 20 years ago so


---------19:38----------
the world is changing the challenges


---------19:40----------
that we face seem insurmountable


---------19:42----------
mental health is like at an all-time


---------19:43----------
high in terms of like how much it screws


---------19:46----------
people over you have Nene's in South


---------19:48----------
American eat that Abajo and knee


---------19:50----------
estudiar you have meats not an


---------19:52----------
employment education and training you


---------19:54----------
have the lowest employment of like men


---------19:57----------
between the ages of 18 and 25 you have a


---------20:00----------
suicide rate that is 50% higher among


---------20:02----------
that is growing by 50% amongst


---------20:04----------
adolescents over the last decade you


---------20:06----------
have video game addiction that is at


---------20:08----------
around six percent of the population and


---------20:10----------
below the age of 18 it's like nine point


---------20:12----------
five percent the world is getting worse


---------20:15----------
and we have the tools now like look at


---------20:18----------
my face like I'm smiling because we can


---------20:20----------
fight this we can do this because we


---------20:22----------
have twitch right it's the very things


---------20:24----------
videogames keep you stuck and alone and


---------20:27----------
stuff like that but there's also like


---------20:28----------
discord keeps you at home because the


---------20:30----------
you I don't have any friends in real


---------20:32----------
life but they're people now on discord


---------20:34----------
who can teach you how to code there are


---------20:35----------
people on Twitter who will teach you how


---------20:37----------
to meditate it's kind of like we're


---------20:39----------
playing hard mode version of life where


---------20:42----------
the challenges that we face are a lot


---------20:44----------
greater than they've ever been and we


---------20:46----------
can talk about why that is in terms of


---------20:48----------
mental health but we also have tools in


---------20:51----------
support in ways that we've never like


---------20:53----------
had them before so you can like become a


---------20:56----------
game developer from your home and you


---------20:58----------
can learn how to code from github and


---------21:00----------
you can do all this stuff like at home


---------21:02----------
there's so much power at your disposal


---------21:04----------
that has never been there before and I'm


---------21:07----------
grateful for twitch and YouTube and like


---------21:08----------
