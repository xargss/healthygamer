---------02:24----------
closer together and


---------02:26----------
it's kind of bittersweet but can help us


---------02:28----------
move forward


---------02:30----------
right and so what that you said you've


---------02:33----------
been struggling with depression and


---------02:34----------
anxiety for three years


---------02:37----------
mostly anxiety for the past three years


---------02:39----------
yeah oh my god so


---------02:40----------
uh yeah yeah yeah well shall i give you


---------02:44----------
the short


---------02:44----------
story sure okay so pretty much


---------02:48----------
and my viewers hate hearing this because


---------02:49----------
i'm like a broken record i i try not


---------02:51----------
talk about ever


---------02:52----------
uh but about i i've been streaming on


---------02:54----------
and off for seven years


---------02:56----------
back in 2015 i st my partner


---------02:59----------
um we split up and i streamed every day


---------03:02----------
in 2015 in 2016 in april of 2016


---------03:06----------
i got permanently banned on twitch


---------03:07----------
because i used to get like 10


---------03:09----------
000 viewers but i used i was a horrible


---------03:13----------
person


---------03:13----------
right i used to just be so toxic and i


---------03:16----------
uh


---------03:16----------
i got myself permanently banned by abide


---------03:19----------
by just slandering someone's name


---------03:21----------
right i got permanently banned the day


---------03:23----------
that happened


---------03:25----------
oh i i was scared to talk to about


---------03:28----------
anything to anyone i become this i just


---------03:31----------
become


---------03:32----------
so scared to even speak and i've just


---------03:34----------
kind of


---------03:35----------
it took me years i've just got over it


---------03:37----------
i've just got over it now i'm like


---------03:40----------
i just don't give a [ __ ] anymore i


---------03:42----------
shouldn't swear sorry but i just don't


---------03:44----------
care anymore just talk


---------03:45----------
say and i feel ten times better and uh


---------03:48----------
so yeah anxiety


---------03:50----------
you know but i was just so scared to


---------03:52----------
talk like on twitch i was scared to say


---------03:54----------
anything i was scared to swear i was so


---------03:56----------
scared to even do anything but


---------03:58----------
i'm over it now and life's great life's


---------04:00----------
perfect i'm just a bit annoyed with


---------04:01----------
today


---------04:02----------
because my daughter i was meant to


---------04:04----------
stream today and i i have a daughter


---------04:06----------
right


---------04:06----------
and she was meant to go to school but


---------04:08----------
her temperature was 38 so the school


---------04:10----------
wouldn't allow her in because of this


---------04:11----------
coronavirus


---------04:12----------
so i couldn't stream today and um i'm a


---------04:14----------
bit my friend's here now looking after


---------04:16----------
her she's fine


---------04:17----------
now she's fine oh here oh great here she


---------04:19----------
is hello hiya


---------04:20----------
hi uh yes yes what do you want yes yes


---------04:23----------
you're gonna go next door


---------04:26----------
she's four five three nearly 33.


---------04:29----------
oh i tell you what she can't speak so if


---------04:32----------
you want to


---------04:32----------
come over to my house in real life and


---------04:34----------
give some lessons that would be great


---------04:36----------
we're getting all the help she can trust


---------04:38----------
me she's got all the help she can get


---------04:40----------
she just can't speak interesting


---------04:43----------
yeah you know it's a funny thing um


---------04:46----------
sometimes kids that are super super


---------04:47----------
smart actually don't


---------04:49----------
they learn to speak slower because they


---------04:52----------
actually can communicate without


---------04:54----------
speaking


---------04:55----------
right they're sort of like


---------04:58----------
you know it's interesting yeah i'm with


---------04:59----------
you that's what they say they said she


---------05:00----------
keeps


---------05:01----------
all the information to herself she's not


---------05:03----------
expressing herself


---------05:04----------
so um but yeah we're really close and um


---------05:07----------
with me and a mum we split up half a


---------05:09----------
year ago and we got a 50 50.


---------05:11----------
so i take it for one week then a month


---------05:12----------
takes for one week i'll have it for one


---------05:14----------
week


---------05:14----------
month you got me yeah that's it yeah


---------05:19----------
sounds like she has she's having fun


---------05:20----------
with daddy at home well actually she's


---------05:22----------
addicted to this pad


---------05:24----------
and i can't get her off it but is it a


---------05:26----------
bad thing this


---------05:27----------
is these pads for kids are the you know


---------05:29----------
the ipads is it a bad thing


---------05:31----------
so i think the the trickiest thing is


---------05:33----------
actually though


---------05:34----------
whether it's long form or short form


---------05:36----------
content


---------05:38----------
so generally speaking uh we want to be


---------05:40----------
careful with kids that


---------05:43----------
can like essentially switch things very


---------05:45----------
quickly or things that have commercials


---------05:47----------
or like short video clips because that


---------05:48----------
sort of


---------05:49----------
reinforces a short attention span


---------05:52----------
whereas electronics that are more long


---------05:54----------
form like if you if they watch like a


---------05:55----------
whole


---------05:56----------
episode of something um that's actually


---------05:59----------
i think


---------05:59----------
better for their attention than you know


---------06:02----------
things that are sort of like pop-ups and


---------06:03----------
like


---------06:04----------
all of you so as long as it's a long


---------06:06----------
form i think it's


---------06:07----------
it's okay but the short answer right


---------06:12----------
yeah yeah i was gonna make sure she


---------06:14----------
don't tell my pc she always goes to my


---------06:16----------
pc and turns it off sometimes yeah


---------06:18----------
i know what you mean oh shaw's a biscuit


---------06:20----------
i'm listening doctor


---------06:21----------
yeah that's fine take take care of your


---------06:22----------
kid man what's her name


---------06:24----------
if you don't mind me asking it's ellie


---------06:27----------
and what's your name


---------06:29----------
ali your name is ally yeah well my dad's


---------06:32----------
turkish


---------06:33----------
all right so it's meant to be pronounced


---------06:35----------
ali but


---------06:37----------
i can't speak turkish doc okay and i


---------06:39----------
won't lie to you i'm pretty nervous but


---------06:41----------
as the interview goes on i'll calm down


---------06:43----------
my nerves are really


---------06:44----------
high but i'm coming down but yeah her


---------06:46----------
name's ellie and a lot of people


---------06:47----------
think it's cringe but i named her after


---------06:49----------
that gel win the last of us


---------06:51----------
you know ellie because i first played


---------06:53----------
the lot i haven't played it but i


---------06:55----------
i need to oh dark yeah you should um


---------06:57----------
yeah when i first played that game i was


---------06:59----------
like oh if i have a kid a girl


---------07:01----------
i want to be like ellie and the last of


---------07:02----------
us so yeah


---------07:04----------
that's it that's something like cringe


---------07:06----------
but honestly she's cute as hell


---------07:07----------
yeah yeah she's she's amazing she looks


---------07:09----------
but you know this by the way like you


---------07:11----------
know the anxiety


---------07:13----------
like you do know that anxiety is


---------07:14----------
depression's best friend right if you


---------07:16----------
guys


---------07:16----------
if someone's got anxiety the pressure's


---------07:18----------
going to be right next door to it you


---------07:20----------
know that right


---------07:20----------
yeah great so yeah so it was only when


---------07:23----------
my partner left me half a year ago


---------07:25----------
and i don't want to get like telling my


---------07:26----------
life story but she left me half a year


---------07:28----------
ago because pretty much we weren't going


---------07:30----------
anywhere in the relationship


---------07:31----------
right it when she left i pulled up my


---------07:33----------
socks


---------07:34----------
i was like i'm gonna be a dad i'm gonna


---------07:36----------
start doing everything she does


---------07:38----------
and i was like i'm gonna start streaming


---------07:40----------
because i haven't streamed in three to


---------07:41----------
four years because i had this really


---------07:42----------
this cute


---------07:43----------
trolley community and they scared the


---------07:45----------
[ __ ] out of me like they were


---------07:47----------
my community still to this day they


---------07:49----------
scared me they say things to me they


---------07:51----------
know where i've been


---------07:51----------
i'm convinced they i'm convinced these


---------07:53----------
guys are tracking my car they got a


---------07:55----------
device to track my car


---------07:56----------
they know everything about me they know


---------07:58----------
where i've been which day i can't hide


---------07:59----------
nothing


---------08:00----------
right you're communicating yeah but i


---------08:02----------
mean i'm not


---------08:03----------
the more you show them the more i show


---------08:05----------
to where i'm scared the more they might


---------08:06----------
mess around me now


---------08:07----------
they don't surprise me you know but it's


---------08:09----------
just people in general they like to


---------08:10----------
freak me out and that


---------08:12----------
would normally give me anxiety but now i


---------08:14----------
just kind of laugh with it that i i


---------08:15----------
brought


---------08:16----------
like a new car right like two months ago


---------08:19----------
a jaguar right and i was hiding the


---------08:21----------
number plate i didn't want to know


---------08:22----------
the number plate because if you have


---------08:23----------
someone's number plate you can find out


---------08:24----------
the details off the car


---------08:26----------
how comes i went on stream the next day


---------08:27----------
and they're all spamming the number


---------08:29----------
plate


---------08:29----------
how how do they know that doc you know


---------08:32----------
so that's why


---------08:32----------
i know man yeah people are the people


---------08:35----------
are smart and i said to them all


---------08:37----------
all the people my community they should


---------08:38----------
work for the fbi because


---------08:40----------
they're too smart you know but um but


---------08:43----------
for the


---------08:43----------
past three years i've been scared of


---------08:45----------
them they would terrify me but now


---------08:47----------
i just smile and i've got cctv


---------08:50----------
and whatever you know it's one of them


---------08:51----------
things what what is scary about that


---------08:55----------
well they know my address right and um


---------09:00----------
i'm pretty much i've been dark i've been


---------09:03----------
trolled so hard i've been trolled so


---------09:06----------
hard


---------09:06----------
no you couldn't even i you know yeah i


---------09:08----------
could yeah i couldn't even


---------09:10----------
begin it's you could i've had do you


---------09:12----------
want me to go into detail


---------09:14----------
true okay i've had some okay so the


---------09:17----------
first thing is unpaid food right so


---------09:19----------
you've got your address thing people


---------09:20----------
want to send you unpaid food


---------09:21----------
that's that's easy mode i've had i've


---------09:23----------
had i've had someone


---------09:24----------
on my door opening cracking the lock and


---------09:26----------
i'm like what are you doing and they're


---------09:27----------
like oh we got a phone call


---------09:29----------
that you were locked in your bathroom so


---------09:30----------
they put locksmiths to my door i've had


---------09:33----------
people come to my door with snakes


---------09:35----------
like snakes snakes like oh you ordered


---------09:38----------
some snakes i'm like nah i did not order


---------09:39----------
snakes


---------09:40----------
i've had sad things happen i've had


---------09:42----------
children come with bags of toys


---------09:44----------
because someone's placed an advert


---------09:45----------
saying i need toys


---------09:47----------
so these poor children bringing bags of


---------09:50----------
toys to me


---------09:51----------
i i won't lie to you the most people


---------09:52----------
find this funny but i've had hookers


---------09:55----------
legit hookers sent to my address and


---------09:57----------
they're all like with a pimp


---------09:59----------
i've had that and it's been terrifying


---------10:00----------
you know and


---------10:02----------
like people like my reactions they find


---------10:04----------
it hilarious and i you know


---------10:05----------
um i get stuff said to me all the time


---------10:07----------
and wow i see the funny side but there


---------10:09----------
are some bad sides to it but


---------10:10----------
but best thing to do is i don't i just


---------10:13----------
kind of laugh it all now


---------10:14----------
the more that i get scared of it the


---------10:16----------
more that i'm gonna play on myself and


---------10:17----------
get anxious and then depressed


---------10:18----------
so i just kind of like take it i always


---------10:20----------
have my best friend he works for me now


---------10:22----------
so he makes sure


---------10:22----------
the streams always go smooth so that's a


---------10:24----------
new thing we did you know that girl


---------10:26----------
anita she's got a problem with some guys


---------10:28----------
stalking her what you should do


---------10:30----------
is should you get someone pay someone to


---------10:32----------
make sure that no one's gonna


---------10:33----------
security pay for security every time you


---------10:36----------
get someone outside think about it right


---------10:38----------
um but yeah that matches the beginning i


---------10:40----------
could tell you a hundred things


---------10:42----------
you'd probably end up laughing but yeah


---------10:44----------
i'm good now ali um


---------10:46----------
what what did you want to was there


---------10:48----------
something in particular that you wanted


---------10:49----------
to focus on today i


---------10:50----------
i'd love you know i'm happy to hear


---------10:52----------
randy i'm more than happy to be on you


---------10:54----------

---------10:55----------

---------11:06----------
in july of 2017.


---------11:08----------
okay it was a year and a half won't lie


---------11:10----------
to you


---------11:11----------
being banned on twitch it's the worst


---------11:13----------
thing in the world it's it's


---------11:15----------
like it's like a party you're not


---------11:16----------
invited to and no one wants to do


---------11:18----------
business with you no stream wants to


---------11:19----------
know you everyone will


---------11:20----------
follow you people to see it as bad


---------11:21----------
business and it was the worst year and a


---------11:23----------
half


---------11:24----------
of my life right i had often been on


---------11:26----------
youtube


---------11:28----------
no one knows i wish people could just


---------11:30----------
feel the feeling of how i felt then


---------11:32----------
oh i wanted to kill myself i i legit got


---------11:35----------
um


---------11:35----------
what's it called again when you get when


---------11:37----------
you're harmed yourself


---------11:38----------
and you get restrained by the police in


---------11:40----------
the hospital where that you're a danger


---------11:41----------
to yourself


---------11:42----------
right what's the word for it ryan


---------11:45----------
there's a word for it


---------11:46----------
you know what's it called um section


---------11:48----------
section cisco


---------11:49----------
section the day i got banned on twitch


---------11:52----------
you know i made a video got millions


---------11:53----------
like two million views on youtube but i


---------11:55----------
i legit was gonna go kill myself and


---------11:57----------
then i got took by the police there and


---------11:58----------
then


---------11:59----------
and i was put into like uh a hospital


---------12:02----------
because i was


---------12:03----------
i was like yep i've got no point of


---------12:05----------
living and that was it and then it took


---------12:07----------
that year and a half i just spent money


---------12:09----------
i didn't stream


---------12:10----------
i i legit kind of streamed and i just


---------12:13----------
spent my money and then after a year and


---------12:14----------
a half


---------12:15----------
twitch i i appealed i i i did i did


---------12:18----------
change


---------12:19----------
but i didn't have to change i just had


---------12:20----------
to tone it down a bit so instead of


---------12:22----------
ch i changed too much i lost my fan base


---------12:26----------
i lost them all i look because i went


---------12:27----------
from crazy


---------12:29----------
open book character to this riddled


---------12:33----------
anxious boring sheep of a guy


---------12:36----------
and noah found me interesting twitch let


---------12:37----------
me back but i lost to my fans


---------12:39----------
it's only been recently where i'm on i'm


---------12:41----------
i'm becoming the old me


---------12:43----------
but without the without the negative


---------12:44----------
yeah yeah so it sounds like you found


---------12:47----------
balance


---------12:48----------
yeah yeah you know starting to to be


---------12:50----------
your true self and be kind of


---------12:52----------
entertaining and


---------12:53----------
and fun to watch and at the same time


---------12:55----------
not overboard


---------12:56----------
that's right because back then i was a


---------12:58----------
small streamer so i was doing anything


---------12:59----------
to get attention but then i blew up and


---------13:01----------
become a big streamer


---------13:02----------
and the spotlight was on me and i was


---------13:04----------
still would say and do anything for


---------13:05----------
attention so i was a very i would call


---------13:08----------
all the shoutcasters names all the time


---------13:09----------
i'm talking horrible names like the


---------13:12----------
older women are cool


---------13:13----------
and i'm not proud of it like paul and


---------13:15----------
stuff so why do you why do you think you


---------13:17----------
would do anything for attention


---------13:20----------
oh i i i already i i knew this was


---------13:23----------
coming


---------13:23----------
because okay you've got to start asking


---------13:25----------
me why i'm the biggest attention seeker


---------13:27----------
in the world doc and i can explain why

---------17:15----------
villain do you understand


---------17:17----------
they're looking at her your


---------17:20----------
mom her mom is a villain my ex yeah


---------17:22----------

her school


---------17:28----------
she's ecstatic when she sees me when she


---------17:30----------

---------17:43----------
air right now and they're really trying


---------17:44----------
to make her speak


---------17:45----------
because she can't speak right now so if


---------17:46----------
something is going on we don't know


---------17:49----------

---------17:52----------
even right she just came around the


---------17:54----------

---------18:00----------
drama gosh but how you how do you handle


---------18:02----------
that


---------18:03----------
ali what do you mean oh well i i can't


---------18:06----------
worry about it too much because i've got


---------18:07----------
a life to live i got provided i've got a


---------18:08----------
stream so i


---------18:09----------
i could spend all because my ex partner


---------18:12----------

---------18:20----------
to say you know when i want her to give


---------18:22----------

---------18:27----------
you know set my car fire and put me in


---------18:28----------

---------18:31----------
to like him but i can't live my life


---------18:34----------
worrying when she's with her mum i can't


---------18:36----------
live my life like that or could because


---------18:38----------
let me tell you something smoking's bad


---------18:40----------

---------18:53----------
i look after when she's with me when


---------18:54----------
she's with


---------18:58----------

---------19:01----------
i just think to myself i'm even going to


---------19:03----------
spend the rest of my life until she's 18


---------19:05----------
worrying


---------19:05----------
or i just got to get on with it and and


---------19:08----------
be happy


---------19:09----------
and get on with the work so i can


---------19:10----------
provide for her because um


---------19:13----------
ali so so i i was under the impression


---------19:16----------
you had wanted to talk about sort of


---------19:18----------
moving on


---------19:19----------
yeah absolutely yeah can you tell me a


---------19:21----------
little bit about that


---------19:23----------
um okay so i've been on a lot


---------19:26----------
off with this girl for 10 years and um


---------19:30----------
and then about yeah seven months ago she


---------19:33----------
wanted to


---------19:34----------
she she just met this guy oh she met


---------19:36----------
this guy


---------19:38----------
and she's with him now and i hated her


---------19:41----------
for for like four to five months and i


---------19:44----------
oh i couldn't message her and you know


---------19:46----------
the school was like you gotta try and


---------19:48----------
make things right and be friendly to her


---------19:50----------
i couldn't find me i was just so toxic


---------19:52----------
to it i just hated how she just left me


---------19:53----------
and now i only see my daughter half time


---------19:55----------
but about two months ago something


---------19:57----------
happened


---------19:57----------
i woke up one day and there was no hate


---------20:00----------
there was nothing it was just civil and


---------20:03----------
i was like oh and that's when you know


---------20:05----------
you're over someone


---------20:06----------
isn't it because you don't hate them and


---------20:07----------
you don't love them you don't miss them


---------20:09----------
or hate them there's nothing it's just


---------20:10----------
oh


---------20:11----------
oh okay so now we're cool


---------20:14----------
we're fine and i'm happy for her to be


---------20:16----------
with any guy and that's it so


---------20:18----------
i've been happy for the past couple of


---------20:20----------
months i gave like


---------20:22----------
i bought her a pc for three thousand


---------20:24----------
pounds when she


---------20:25----------
when she left she was trying to take the


---------20:27----------
pc i was like hold up we're not married


---------20:28----------
i thought if you want that pc


---------20:30----------
it's going to cost you 1300 pounds right


---------20:32----------
and that was a great price


---------20:34----------
and then um she didn't want it i said


---------20:35----------
okay but then we made up and i was like


---------20:37----------
you know what


---------20:38----------
take it for 800 pounds which is an


---------20:39----------
amazing price if you saw the specs of


---------20:41----------
this thing


---------20:42----------
and um i don't mind giving her like i


---------20:44----------
just want it gone i just want


---------20:45----------
her to have it or i'm trying to do her


---------20:47----------
favors because that's when you know over


---------20:49----------
someone you don't hold grudges


---------20:50----------
you know so i could promise you i'm over


---------20:53----------
this girl


---------20:54----------
um but it is the um


---------20:57----------
mother of my child so i'm always gonna


---------20:59----------
have a connection with her she's always


---------21:00----------
gonna love


---------21:01----------
i'm really weird every girl i've ever


---------21:03----------
been with i wish them all well


---------21:05----------
i want them to do well you know i don't


---------21:08----------
hate any of them i don't


---------21:09----------
hate anybody because hey for me hate is


---------21:12----------
like when you hate someone


---------21:13----------
it's like why when you hate someone it's


---------21:16----------
like a pressure you go look over your


---------21:17----------
shoulders for all your life


---------21:19----------
you know so yeah but it took time it


---------21:22----------
took time it took about five to six


---------21:24----------
months


---------21:24----------
of getting there but it got there in the


---------21:26----------
end and i'm there's nothing now just i'm


---------21:28----------
happy with her so it's i mean it sounds


---------21:30----------
like you sort of sorted that out


---------21:32----------
yeah i didn't i don't know what happened


---------21:36----------
i just said to ryan who's my best friend


---------21:38----------
i said i just woke up one day and there


---------21:40----------
was no hate


---------21:41----------
and that is when you know your oversight


---------21:42----------
there was nothing i couldn't i didn't i


---------21:43----------
thought i had to think to myself when


---------21:44----------
was the last time i thought about that


---------21:45----------
girl oh three days ago


---------21:47----------
do you know how does that mean


---------21:50----------
time heals everything you know


---------21:53----------
or am i wrong i don't know man


---------21:58----------
yeah i think it's yeah that's kind of


---------22:00----------
depends on


---------22:01----------
on what you say right i mean i i think


---------22:04----------
it's quite remarkable that


---------22:05----------
you know you were filled with so much


---------22:07----------
hate and then one day you wake up and


---------22:08----------
it's gone


---------22:09----------
i just i exactly exactly


---------22:13----------
we i don't know what happened doc


---------22:16----------
yeah so it sort of makes sense i i think


---------22:18----------
i can understand why you would make up


---------22:19----------
for lost time


---------22:20----------
in terms of not speaking because it


---------22:23----------
seems like sometimes you wake up and


---------22:25----------
and your feelings just sort of sort


---------22:26----------
themselves out right


---------22:29----------
interesting time yeah for well everybody


---------22:33----------
everyone's different right so when it


---------22:35----------
comes to me getting over that girl i


---------22:36----------
i've just it might be different from


---------22:38----------
someone else but that's how i got over


---------22:40----------
it time hmm why is that


---------22:43----------
is that the wrong answer because you're


---------22:44----------
looking at me no it's it's not the wrong


---------22:46----------
answer i i


---------22:47----------
i ali i don't i don't have the right


---------22:50----------
answers i'm just curious because


---------22:52----------
you know a lot of times when we talk


---------22:55----------
gotta say something yeah yeah go ahead


---------22:57----------
um when i got banned on twitter 2016


---------23:00----------
because i've always had breakdowns i'd


---------23:02----------
always be emotional i'm either i'm


---------23:04----------
ecstatically


---------23:05----------
emotional so i went and got i'm gonna


---------23:07----------
saw a psychiatrist


---------23:09----------
and um and then i went to source i went


---------23:11----------
and saw a psychiatrist and within two


---------23:13----------
hours of


---------23:14----------
psych diagnosing me which was


---------23:17----------
obviously private it cost me 250 pounds


---------23:20----------
an hour which is like 320 bucks


---------23:22----------
an hour in that two hour period she


---------23:24----------
diagnosed me with bipolar


---------23:25----------
right so there's that and my nan was


---------23:28----------
also bipolar and uh pretty much let me


---------23:31----------
say this they put me on


---------23:33----------
mood stabilizers right calm the mood so


---------23:36----------
either take them before i slept


---------23:38----------
but then they were like okay after you


---------23:39----------
take the mood stabilizers we're going to


---------23:41----------
put you on um


---------23:43----------
um so called lithium right so i was like


---------23:45----------
okay now like i can lithium you gotta


---------23:47----------
take for the rest of your life okay i


---------23:48----------
was like okay sure let's do this


---------23:50----------
so they write me a um they got they've


---------23:52----------
got the right prescription


---------23:53----------
to be handed in to the um beyond the


---------23:57----------
till


---------23:57----------
to get this lithium so i take it there


---------24:00----------
and they turn around and go oh the


---------24:01----------
doctors forgot to sign it you have to go


---------24:03----------
take it back


---------24:04----------
and i know at that point i don't want to


---------24:05----------
sound i don't want to sound like


---------24:06----------
superstitious or anything like that i'm


---------24:08----------
not christian


---------24:09----------
but i believe there was a force out


---------24:10----------
there in life where that wasn't meant to


---------24:13----------
be


---------24:13----------
do you understand what i'm trying to say


---------24:14----------
doc so i didn't after she didn't sign it


---------24:17----------
i was like no it's no no this is


---------24:18----------
happening for a reason i'm not


---------24:19----------
i'm not going to be on this lithium


---------24:20----------
because that drug is like


---------24:23----------
that what i've been told that drug is a


---------24:25----------
strong drug that it's like


---------24:26----------
don't touch that button and that drug is


---------24:29----------
like dangerous and you've got to be on


---------24:30----------
it for life and it'll calm you right


---------24:32----------
down


---------24:32----------
i think they give it like people what


---------24:34----------
they'll consider what crazy


---------24:36----------
i know people get offended by the word


---------24:37----------
crazy but that lithium drug you should


---------24:39----------
know


---------24:39----------
it's like don't mix of that that's some


---------24:42----------
dangerous stuff


---------24:43----------
you know um be


---------24:46----------
right so i'll let you know so i i was


---------24:49----------
watching reckful's


---------24:50----------
you did interview with redford he's


---------24:52----------

---------27:22----------
changed and then in order to sleep with


---------27:24----------
someone you had to be


---------27:25----------
with them now that this day and age no


---------27:28----------
one cares


---------27:29----------
everybody seems anybody and no one gives


---------27:31----------
a [ __ ] right you got all these rappers


---------27:33----------
bragging about in their songs


---------27:34----------
the the men and the women and i feel


---------27:37----------
like we're in a generation now where


---------27:38----------
people are doing open relationships


---------27:40----------
people are just happy being free all the


---------27:41----------
time no one has the time for


---------27:42----------
relationships


---------27:43----------
and the past half year i've been dating


---------27:45----------
women but i never get with them and


---------27:47----------
i tell them that from the start and we


---------27:49----------
just enjoy our moments together


---------27:50----------
you know i think relationships and this


---------27:52----------
is just my opinion i don't want anyone


---------27:53----------
to get offended


---------27:54----------
right i think relationships are dying


---------27:56----------
out i just think people aren't doing


---------27:57----------
relationships because people don't have


---------27:58----------
the time for it


---------27:59----------
you can still spend time with someone


---------28:00----------
have a good time don't need to label it


---------28:02----------
you know i just don't feel and that's


---------28:04----------
for marriage marriage


---------28:06----------
wow i just think that's so old-fashioned


---------28:08----------
i don't think i'm ever going to get


---------28:09----------
married doc


---------28:10----------
and i thought you know because when


---------28:11----------
you're free and there's no label on it


---------28:14----------
it's lovely


---------28:15----------
you know there's there's a science


---------28:16----------
scientists say that us human beings are


---------28:19----------
aren't born to be with each other


---------28:21----------
forever only dolphins are


---------28:24----------
is that a true fact or am i am i reading


---------28:26----------
fake news


---------28:30----------
yeah i mean i i think i think human


---------28:32----------
beings have been


---------28:33----------
oftentimes monogamous in the history of


---------28:35----------
humanity


---------28:37----------
and and i think that so that means that


---------28:40----------
people have been and committed


---------28:41----------
one-on-one relationships for a lot of


---------28:43----------
humanity and i don't tend to think that


---------28:45----------
like human beings


---------28:46----------
are one way so i think that we have


---------28:48----------
tendencies to be


---------28:50----------
in you know relationships that are more


---------28:52----------
open and we have tendencies to be in


---------28:54----------
relationships that are more committed


---------28:56----------
and i don't think like humanity i i


---------28:58----------
think either side that says


---------29:00----------
oh science says that open relationships


---------29:02----------
are bad


---------29:03----------
or scion says that open uh committed


---------29:05----------
relationships are bad i think neither of


---------29:07----------
those people really understand science


---------29:09----------
because it's like we're complex human


---------29:11----------
we're complex organisms that's been my


---------29:13----------
understanding and i think if it works


---------29:15----------
for you i i think that's fine i think um


---------29:17----------
you know like like you said so it sounds


---------29:19----------
like they're a lot of work


---------29:21----------
and that um you you tend to find a lot


---------29:23----------
of enjoyment


---------29:24----------
out of kind of more temporary


---------29:25----------
relationships


---------29:27----------
right and and so marriage sounds like


---------29:30----------
headache and bondage every the thing is


---------29:33----------
doc


---------29:33----------
every time you've got to remember this


---------29:35----------
you're smart i'm dumb


---------29:37----------
right simple as that so when you're


---------29:38----------
talking words to me


---------29:40----------
i like how you're talking to me you


---------29:42----------
you've got to get to my level because


---------29:43----------
otherwise i'm not going to understand


---------29:44----------
you


---------29:44----------
right i know you're very extremely smart


---------29:46----------
i got you um but let me say this


---------29:49----------
and i'm going to be honest um every time


---------29:53----------
i you know i'm very open book every time


---------29:56----------
i get


---------29:57----------
and i don't mean to brag i've i've been


---------29:59----------
with 22 women 23 women


---------30:00----------
right in my life right when it comes to


---------30:03----------
sleeping with the whole way that's not


---------30:05----------
including other


---------30:06----------
foreplay okay all these women that i've


---------30:09----------
been with


---------30:09----------
i can promise you i and i'm not bragging


---------30:12----------
every woman i get with they always try


---------30:15----------
and get me in the relationship with them


---------30:17----------
right and so most of my relationships


---------30:19----------
i've landed in the relationship without


---------30:21----------
even wanting to be there


---------30:22----------
you know you know how it can be if


---------30:24----------
you're a nice guy


---------30:26----------
one of these women or guys they you know


---------30:29----------
they give you


---------30:29----------
and next you know it you're in a


---------30:31----------
relationship you're moving it together


---------30:33----------
now let's talk about marriage and you


---------30:34----------
didn't consent to it it just kind of


---------30:36----------
fell into place


---------30:37----------
and i always fought for that trap it


---------30:39----------
happened all my life i'm 28.


---------30:41----------
it's happened all my life so now i'm


---------30:42----------
like no no no i need to start being more


---------30:45----------
you got to be cruel to be kind to doc


---------30:47----------
you know that you know that


---------30:50----------
what does that mean you got to be cool


---------30:51----------
to be kind you've got to be cruel to be


---------30:53----------
kind


---------30:54----------
to be kind okay okay so if you're always


---------30:57----------
nice if you there's a girl that you like


---------30:58----------
and she likes you and you make out


---------31:00----------
that's fantastic


---------31:01----------
if she if you have consent sex with each


---------31:02----------
other fantastic but she might get the


---------31:05----------
incentive that you want to be with her


---------31:07----------
and you got to tell her from the get-go


---------31:09----------
actually


---------31:10----------
this isn't you've got to hurt her a bit


---------31:12----------
to let know where she stands if you


---------31:13----------
don't tell her


---------31:14----------
that hey this is only you know us dating


---------31:18----------
temporary


---------31:19----------
she's going to get led on and she's


---------31:20----------
going to get hurt way worse


---------31:22----------
rather than telling her now yeah it's


---------31:24----------
best to be cruel to be kind


---------31:26----------
early you understand that it's happening


---------31:29----------
no no it's not but it's just saying it


---------31:32----------
it sounded cool i said it no i mean i


---------31:34----------
i think it makes sense that you know it


---------31:35----------
sounds to me that being


---------31:37----------
sort of honest and transparent about


---------31:39----------
what your intentions are towards a


---------31:40----------
relationship is absolutely a good thing


---------31:43----------
even as soon as you make it out as soon


---------31:45----------
as you get to know each other


---------31:46----------
put it out on the table that's my advice


---------31:48----------
to your viewers if you want to get with


---------31:50----------
a girl or a guy


---------31:52----------
just let them know where you stand


---------31:53----------
straight away don't get yourself


---------31:55----------
block going don't go blindly because if


---------31:58----------
you do you're going to be ended up in a


---------31:59----------
relationship can i explain this


---------32:00----------
my daughter do you want to know how that


---------32:02----------
happened right sure three years


---------32:05----------
three years ago i was with this spanish


---------32:08----------
woman


---------32:08----------
i got bad on twitch i went to spain i


---------32:10----------
had a spanish girlfriend which i didn't


---------32:11----------
want to be with but we landed in a


---------32:12----------
relationship like we're talking about


---------32:13----------
we finally broke up and it was kind of


---------32:15----------
messy i then had an italian girlfriend


---------32:16----------
who funny enough i made up with lot


---------32:18----------
last night i had so we we dated and that


---------32:22----------
ended


---------32:22----------
terrible because drama and then straight


---------32:25----------
after i


---------32:26----------
got with um the mother of mother of my


---------32:28----------
child right so we


---------32:30----------
hooked up on on on a couple of occasions


---------32:33----------
just for


---------32:34----------
just for sex and she was you know the


---------32:37----------
truth is she didn't plan on getting


---------32:38----------
pregnant she didn't know she can get


---------32:40----------
pregnant because she


---------32:40----------
was she was convinced she couldn't get


---------32:42----------
pregnant and then


---------32:44----------
she was we were friends and she was


---------32:46----------
looking for accommodation so she stayed


---------32:47----------
with me because i was being nice because


---------32:49----------
i'm a nice guy


---------32:50----------
and then the first i moved into this


---------32:52----------
house doc i'm cleaning my car


---------32:53----------
i'm looking up i talked to my neighbours


---------32:56----------
i looked up i said thank you god


---------32:57----------
i've got my supra which is my sports car


---------32:59----------
i looked up and thank you god nothing


---------33:01----------
can ruin this moment


---------33:02----------
i turned around i opened the door and


---------33:04----------
she went i'm pregnant


---------33:05----------
while holding a pregnancy stick so i


---------33:08----------
said


---------33:09----------
yeah yeah and i said [ __ ] you and she


---------33:12----------
she was like


---------33:12----------
shocked like this like but no no no


---------33:15----------
seriously [ __ ] you because i don't i


---------33:16----------
don't really believe in abortion right


---------33:18----------
so i was so upset i cried i never i


---------33:21----------
never cried i went to my mum's i said


---------33:23----------
mom i don't want this i can't be a dad


---------33:25----------
i'm


---------33:25----------
terrible um and my mum really loved her


---------33:28----------
so my mom was like


---------33:29----------
encouraging it which is another note to


---------33:31----------
all the viewers out there


---------33:33----------
don't don't force yourself to stay with


---------33:36----------
someone if you don't want to be


---------33:38----------
of them it's not right right you connect


---------33:40----------
because you're gonna they're


---------33:41----------
you're wasting your time and you're


---------33:42----------
wasting their time and that's what i


---------33:44----------
learned with my ex


---------33:46----------
ally your camera's just a touch blurry


---------33:48----------
i'm sorry yeah so


---------33:50----------
so aly i want to kind of dig into one


---------33:52----------
thing maybe


---------33:53----------
so you say that you you land into


---------33:55----------
relationships and then you also said


---------33:57----------
that one day you kind of wake up


---------33:59----------
and then there was like no more hatred


---------34:01----------
so i'm kind of noticing that like


---------34:03----------
sometimes


---------34:04----------
they're just the language that you use


---------34:06----------
almost makes it sound like


---------34:09----------
you know things sort of happen outside


---------34:11----------
of your


---------34:12----------
intentions or control


---------34:14----------
[Music]


---------34:16----------
sorry ask me the question one more time


---------34:21----------
there wasn't even a question there i'm


---------34:23----------
just making an observation that


---------34:24----------
sometimes the way that you talk about


---------34:26----------
things you sort of say like i


---------34:27----------
i you know you wind up in a relationship


---------34:29----------
yep that's right


---------34:30----------
it and it's you make it sound like the


---------34:32----------
weather you know right


---------34:34----------
and and also like when it comes to your


---------34:36----------
mood you kind of mention that you know


---------34:37----------
one day you woke up and


---------34:38----------
and your hatred was gone and that too it


---------34:41----------
sort of sounds like a roll of the dice


---------34:44----------
yeah yeah yeah so i'm just i'm just


---------34:46----------
wondering whether there's some value


---------34:48----------
into digging into like


---------34:49----------
how do things happen in your life and


---------34:51----------
like what role do you play in them


---------34:54----------
because it's kind of interesting right


---------34:55----------
because if people could learn


---------34:58----------
what happened to you right so my life's


---------35:02----------
i've always just gone into life blindly


---------35:04----------
i've never had enough structure it's


---------35:05----------
only been recently where i'm like okay


---------35:09----------
i'm gonna stream every day right i'm


---------35:11----------
gonna have my best friend


---------35:13----------
look out for me and he's gonna help me


---------35:15----------
and we're just going to


---------35:16----------
focus on no relationships going i'm


---------35:19----------
having a good time every couple of


---------35:20----------
weekends


---------35:21----------
right we can't do every weekend so i've


---------35:22----------
got my daughter on on the weekends on


---------35:24----------
the week where i have her


---------35:25----------
and right now it's just full focus


---------35:28----------
twitch all in


---------35:28----------
with our chips twitch tv right so for


---------35:31----------
the first time in my life because i'm


---------35:33----------
now 28 i've just realized to have


---------35:34----------
structure but before the past 28 years


---------35:37----------
i've just been doing life blindly and


---------35:39----------
i've been that's why i've been


---------35:40----------
so with relationships jumping in in and


---------35:44----------
out


---------35:44----------
in and out there's been drama there's


---------35:46----------
been hatred but for the first time


---------35:48----------
you need you definitely need in your


---------35:49----------
life like a um


---------35:51----------
a plan like a routine or yeah an idea of


---------35:54----------
where you want your life to go


---------35:56----------
what do you want start planning now


---------35:58----------
where do you want to be in a couple of


---------35:59----------
years time


---------36:00----------
yeah so so can you tell me how do you


---------36:02----------
how do you


---------36:03----------
like how did you wind up in a


---------36:04----------
relationship


---------36:06----------
the last one yeah sure anyhow okay so we


---------36:09----------
she obviously was pregnant and she was


---------36:13----------
with with her


---------36:14----------
and there were talks hooks of abortion


---------36:16----------
and even though we were both against it


---------36:18----------
it and anyone watching could say they're


---------36:20----------
against abortion but the second that you


---------36:22----------
are in that predicament where you have


---------36:24----------
someone pregnant


---------36:25----------
you you start thinking maybe i'm not so


---------36:28----------
much against it do you understand doc


---------36:30----------
sure do you understand because it's


---------36:31----------
different when you're in that position


---------36:33----------
as an outsider from the outside right


---------36:36----------
exactly so their ward talks about it um


---------36:39----------
and believe it or not


---------36:40----------
this the day that and we this is going


---------36:42----------
to sound horrible but the day that


---------36:44----------
it was like a couple of months into it


---------36:46----------
of of because it takes months here in


---------36:48----------
the uk


---------36:49----------
all the way sorry to sound rude but the


---------36:51----------
abortion clinic here in the uk


---------36:53----------
is like a month waiting period because i


---------36:56----------
guess people just love unprotected sex


---------36:58----------
right so we were lined up to do that


---------37:00----------
which sounds horrible that she's here


---------37:02----------
now but back then


---------37:03----------
she wasn't existed we didn't know of her


---------37:05----------
so i don't want people watching thinking


---------37:07----------
oh that's horrible she's right there


---------37:09----------
she wasn't even around it was nothing it


---------37:11----------
wasn't a you know


---------37:12----------
so the day that it was meant to happen


---------37:16----------
tell me why doc the alarm didn't go off


---------37:18----------
i don't know why


---------37:19----------
don't ask me why you know she was gonna


---------37:21----------
said the alarm it never went off


---------37:23----------
right so pretty much i got up i was


---------37:26----------
upset like oh my god


---------37:27----------
are you crazy we can't be adults you


---------37:30----------
know i'm a childish idiot and i'm not


---------37:32----------
ready for this


---------37:33----------
so she starts crying and i thought and i


---------37:35----------
was so nice i was like [ __ ]


---------37:37----------
i can't put this stress on her because


---------37:40----------
if you stress out a woman who's pregnant


---------37:41----------
you can ruin their


---------37:42----------
body you know that right you can ruin a


---------37:44----------
body where they can't even have babe


---------37:46----------
because the stress of


---------37:47----------
so i gave her a hug i said it's fine


---------37:49----------
don't worry about it we have to


---------37:50----------
reschedule


---------37:51----------
but i never did reschedule we never did


---------37:53----------
reschedule next thing you know what doc


---------37:54----------
she's got a bump and it's growing and i


---------37:57----------
just put it off i was like you know what


---------37:59----------
you know this because twitch were on


---------38:00----------
banning me at the same time


---------38:02----------
and twitch were like look we want to


---------38:03----------
give a really clean profile i was like


---------38:05----------
no problem


---------38:06----------
i can't have all the structure so next


---------38:07----------
thing now that she's you know she's


---------38:09----------
i became overweight by the way that's


---------38:11----------
another thing i came really overweight


---------38:13----------
and my fans hated me like they made fun


---------38:15----------
of me and


---------38:16----------
with the overweight and all that bad


---------38:18----------
food because when my


---------38:19----------
when my girlfriend was pregnant that


---------38:21----------
women have cravings they crave a lot of


---------38:23----------
food


---------38:23----------
i was eating the craving food as well


---------38:25----------
like the fast food the mcdonald's the


---------38:27----------
kfc's


---------38:28----------
and then pretty much next you know she


---------38:30----------
gave birth fantastic


---------38:32----------
that was great and then in that year


---------38:35----------
period of


---------38:36----------
uh my daughter being brought up being


---------38:38----------
alive i was i forced myself to stay in


---------38:41----------
that relationship


---------38:42----------
to do the right thing i got to be a


---------38:43----------
parent i got to step up i've got to


---------38:45----------
stand this relationship now this is my


---------38:46----------
life


---------38:46----------
and in that year doc was the worst year


---------38:48----------
of my life i loved my daughter


---------38:50----------
but forced myself self to stay of that


---------38:52----------
woman when i didn't want to be in a


---------38:54----------
relationship it wasn't toxic i just


---------38:56----------
it was so hard um and then


---------39:00----------
because i didn't want to be with the


---------39:01----------
woman i wanted to be free


---------39:03----------
i always like being free and a lot of


---------39:06----------
these and i'm not trying to


---------39:07----------
i'm not at all sexist at all but a lot


---------39:09----------
of the women i get with


---------39:10----------
they see my freedom and they want to


---------39:12----------
just take me and shove me in a cage and


---------39:14----------
hold me there


---------39:15----------

---------40:50----------
it's almost like fate right so like


---------40:52----------
you're talking about these things like


---------40:54----------
you know the the morning that you were


---------40:55----------
scheduled


---------40:57----------
you met you the alarm got unplugged like


---------41:00----------
during the when you got prescribed the


---------41:02----------
lithium somewhat


---------41:04----------
and so i'm just i'm kind of noticing


---------41:06----------
that it i can't


---------41:08----------
tell ali whether you're in control of


---------41:11----------
your life


---------41:12----------
doc i'm convinced i'm confident and i


---------41:15----------
don't want to sound crazy or like


---------41:17----------
insane but i'm convinced that there's


---------41:20----------
it's a stimulation like the matrix that


---------41:22----------
i'm the only real person here and i'm


---------41:23----------
being watched by eight


---------41:25----------
billion trillion aliens in my brain and


---------41:28----------
i'm just a puppet and they're just


---------41:30----------
everyone around me is not real that's


---------41:31----------
what i'm convinced do you understand


---------41:33----------
what i mean by that like how do i know


---------41:34----------
that you're real how do i know she's


---------41:35----------
real


---------41:36----------
it could all be a simulation because


---------41:38----------
everything is just happening for a


---------41:39----------
reason


---------41:40----------
right so i don't sound nuts but you must


---------41:42----------
understand where i'm coming from right


---------41:44----------
yeah because everything's happened for a


---------41:45----------
reason and i believe this and i said


---------41:46----------
this to ryan i'm so


---------41:48----------
glad my twitch career has been dead for


---------41:50----------
the past three years because


---------41:51----------
i didn't want her mother my child to be


---------41:54----------
involved in it because i feel like


---------41:56----------
it wasn't meant to be it's only started


---------41:58----------
taking off the past couple of months doc


---------41:59----------
i'm gonna be honest with you


---------42:01----------
yeah so how does that feel when you say


---------42:03----------
faked you scared the hell out of me


---------42:05----------
because i used to play league of legends


---------42:07----------
and there was a catholic twisted fate


---------42:08----------
and i don't sound cringy but he's like a


---------42:10----------
card master who believes in fate it's


---------42:11----------
just weird that he said the word fate


---------42:13----------
it is like fake my life is like fake


---------42:15----------
everything has happened for a reason


---------42:16----------
you're scaring me doc yeah yeah yeah so


---------42:19----------
i mean what's up with that


---------42:21----------
don't ask me i don't i don't every let


---------42:24----------
me tell you this right now there is


---------42:25----------
nothing in my life i would change


---------42:27----------
right now at this moment there's nothing


---------42:29----------
zero


---------42:30----------
life's perfect my best friend and me are


---------42:32----------
working together


---------42:33----------
my daughter and me have got the closest


---------42:35----------
relationship


---------42:37----------
all the streamers like me i mean my fat


---------42:39----------
and my viewers


---------42:41----------
they make the content all i got to do is


---------42:42----------
turn up and cook


---------42:45----------
who's responsible for that ally


---------42:49----------
everything in your life is going well


---------42:51----------
right so


---------42:52----------
should i tell you what it is positivity


---------42:54----------
every if you're in life if you're a


---------42:56----------
positive person


---------42:57----------
everybody's positive let me give you an


---------42:59----------
example if you turned up to


---------43:01----------
a car dealership right and you want to


---------43:04----------
buy a car


---------43:04----------
if you turn up or being negative they're


---------43:06----------
not going to want to do business with


---------43:07----------
you if you're all positive and like oh


---------43:09----------
i'm going to work a lot i'm going to do


---------43:10----------
this


---------43:11----------
they might give you that load on that


---------43:12----------
car because they believe in your


---------43:13----------
positivity


---------43:14----------
if you go around all being negative no


---------43:16----------
one wants to be your friend


---------43:17----------
knows to do business no one's to get to


---------43:19----------
know you you've got to be positive to


---------43:21----------
to have positivity in your life and


---------43:23----------
honest to god i'm always smiling


---------43:25----------
i swear to you honest to god and


---------43:28----------

---------43:30----------
me tell you this though doc


---------43:31----------
shall i tell you why sure diet you don't


---------43:34----------
understand


---------43:35----------
doc i don't want to sound like a crazy


---------43:36----------
person but my god


---------43:38----------
the government should ban white pasta


---------43:40----------
white rice


---------43:41----------
white bread it should all be permanently


---------43:42----------
but and i don't want to my dad's turkish


---------43:45----------
i'm not but red meat


---------43:46----------
red meat should be bad it's so unhealthy


---------43:49----------
for you it makes you feel terrible next


---------43:50----------
day


---------43:51----------
it's just as bad as alcohol are you i'm


---------43:53----------
not i'm not religious


---------43:54----------
but i've i've been fat and i've been


---------43:56----------
thin and i'm telling you now


---------43:58----------
diet is effing i i've experimented this


---------44:01----------
100 times


---------44:02----------
if i was to eat a bowl of rice tonight


---------44:04----------
and then wake up tomorrow i'd feel


---------44:06----------
drained i feel terrible i feel depressed


---------44:08----------
legit i feel


---------44:09----------
my brain what do you eat


---------44:13----------
i eat chicken like not i like fried


---------44:17----------
chicken but just


---------44:18----------
cooked chicken with seeds walnuts


---------44:21----------
almonds salad spinach eggs


---------44:25----------
i've got all the time i prefer a salad


---------44:27----------
any time


---------44:28----------
all the time and i feel so strong when i


---------44:30----------
eat it and it makes me feel


---------44:32----------
give it a try flush out your system


---------44:35----------
don't eat anything bad for 24 hours only


---------44:37----------
eat healthy and you'd feel


---------44:38----------
so good but you've got to eat you've got


---------44:40----------
to eat some fats as well because fats


---------44:42----------
fats are designed to make you feel good


---------44:44----------
but not too much fats


---------44:46----------
yeah avocado or if you want to eat


---------44:47----------
chocolate have a bit of chocolate


---------44:49----------
at the end of the day reward yourself or


---------44:50----------
have a couple of sugars in your tea you


---------44:52----------
know but that's the truth


---------44:53----------
it's all about diet people ask me a lot


---------44:55----------
if you look at my instagram i


---------44:57----------
did a transformation i was the if you go


---------44:59----------
back i would


---------45:00----------
my face look like a bumblebee like i was


---------45:02----------
stung by a bumblebee


---------45:03----------
three years ago because i i was 14 stone


---------45:06----------
i'm now 10 eight yeah i know you don't


---------45:09----------
do stuff you do kilograms but


---------45:10----------
you can google it yeah yeah yeah yeah


---------45:12----------
right so pretty much


---------45:14----------
one stone is like 20 pounds 14 pounds


---------45:19----------
okay so you're right you're 20 stone


---------45:23----------
no 14 stone 14 stone okay right so now


---------45:26----------
10 stone eight so 10 stone eight pounds


---------45:29----------
one stone yeah so pretty much either way


---------45:32----------
i've always got energy


---------45:34----------
people think i'm on cocaine all the time


---------45:35----------
i've never done drugs i've only smoked


---------45:37----------
marijuana twice and that was in


---------45:38----------
california twitchcon last year


---------45:40----------
and pretty much i'll tell your viewers


---------45:42----------
right now if you're fighting depression


---------45:43----------
or anxiety


---------45:44----------
number one rule i'd say to you is look


---------45:46----------
at your diet and tell me that isn't your


---------45:48----------
diet doing that to you


---------45:49----------
give it a day where you don't eat bread


---------45:51----------
or pasta or or rice


---------45:53----------
give it a try and just eat the right


---------45:54----------
foods and chicken is amazing fish


---------45:56----------
amazing but yeah that's the one thing


---------45:58----------
i'd say so back to the question


---------46:00----------
um who's doing all this to you first was


---------46:03----------
me


---------46:03----------
and it's my diet and everything else i i


---------46:06----------

---------53:35----------
yeah like a b like you're kind of like


---------53:37----------
moving from flower to flower


---------53:38----------
right right like if you think about like


---------53:42----------
if you think about the existence of a


---------53:43----------
bee it's like it's kind of like


---------53:44----------
happy-go-lucky and it's sort of like


---------53:46----------
you're


---------53:46----------
kind of going over here today like we're


---------53:48----------
on this flower we're gonna appreciate


---------53:50----------
all of its beauty we're gonna just you


---------53:52----------

---------53:53----------
you kind of flip to the next flower


---------53:55----------
you kind of flip to the next flower now


---------53:57----------
i'm hearing i'm hearing notes of of you


---------53:59----------
really trying to structure your life


---------54:01----------
and trying to actually like be dedicated


---------54:03----------
to something which is very not be like


---------54:05----------
you know then it's it's more like you're


---------54:07----------
you're kind of like really kind of


---------54:08----------
focused on building something


---------54:10----------
you're dedicated to streaming streaming


---------54:12----------
every day you're dedicated to building


---------54:13----------
structure for your daughter you have her


---------54:15----------
one week on one week off


---------54:17----------
so you're you're not you know in a sense


---------54:20----------
i think a b is a little bit unfair but i


---------54:22----------
kind of see both of these sides of you


---------54:23----------
one is like


---------54:24----------
you know live for today be with the


---------54:26----------
person that you're with


---------54:27----------
enjoy yourself on any given day


---------54:31----------
be with the woman that you're with and


---------54:33----------
then you know


---------54:34----------
sometimes you feel very very concerned


---------54:36----------
about getting caged


---------54:38----------
and it seems like there's something


---------54:40----------
indescribably attractive


---------54:41----------
to to women about you because once they


---------54:44----------
get a taste of ali they can't


---------54:46----------
they need a little bit more people dog


---------54:48----------
people gonna say


---------54:49----------
people are gonna say cap all the time


---------54:52----------
but doc


---------54:53----------
you gotta see it in person you've gotta


---------54:55----------
see it in person you're gonna see a


---------54:56----------
person


---------54:57----------
i think so man i i believe you dude i i


---------55:00----------
think that there's


---------55:02----------
you know i think you're a very


---------55:03----------
charismatic positive sort of guy right


---------55:06----------
right the thing that i sometimes wonder


---------55:08----------
a little bit about is that you know


---------55:09----------
you're you're talking about


---------55:10----------
feeling perfect in the here and now and


---------55:12----------
that makes sense i think you're


---------55:13----------
genuinely very happy


---------55:15----------
but what i'm also getting the sense of


---------55:17----------
is that that you know that


---------55:19----------
there can be sunny days and there can be


---------55:22----------
cloudy days


---------55:23----------
right right and and that like everything


---------55:25----------
is fine until


---------55:26----------
you feel controlled or until and then


---------55:29----------
something will really upset you


---------55:31----------
or you know even if you kind of talk a


---------55:33----------
little bit about like the story of


---------55:34----------
of how you discovered that you're you


---------55:37----------
know that i don't even know what to call


---------55:38----------
her your ex-girlfriend


---------55:40----------
or was pregnant and and so you know


---------55:42----------
there are a lot of


---------55:43----------
ups and downs right and so i i think


---------55:46----------
and and a lot of times people will call


---------55:48----------
this bipolar i'm not i don't really know


---------55:51----------
i mean i have to i'd have to ask you a


---------55:52----------
bunch of questions i'm not so sure that


---------55:53----------
you're bipolar


---------55:56----------
but because it seems to me that you're


---------55:59----------
so just a quick


---------56:00----------
uh take a step back and and here's my


---------56:03----------
understanding of bipolar


---------56:04----------
a lot of people think about bipolar as


---------56:08----------
um you know like you're like you have a


---------56:11----------
good day and then you have a bad day and


---------56:12----------
you're happy one minute and you're


---------56:14----------
really angry the next minute that's not


---------56:15----------
really


---------56:16----------
bipolar that's what we call emotional


---------56:18----------
lability


---------56:19----------
which means that your emotions can rise


---------56:22----------
and fall very quickly


---------56:23----------
right um bipolar disorder what i really


---------56:26----------
think of is


---------56:27----------
is episodes that last days weeks or even


---------56:31----------
months at a time


---------56:33----------
of being depressed or manic or hypomanic


---------56:37----------
and so the closest thing that i can kind


---------56:39----------
of get to is that you know you


---------56:41----------
you know that's possible that you had


---------56:43----------
that mood episode for four to five


---------56:45----------
months


---------56:45----------
after your uh ex-girlfriend kind of


---------56:48----------
broke up with you or whatever like six


---------56:49----------
seven months ago and you said you one


---------56:51----------
day you woke up and you just felt better


---------56:53----------
that actually is the thing that makes me


---------56:54----------
think the most about any


---------56:56----------
i mean but that just could be you know


---------56:58----------
it doesn't have to be


---------56:59----------
an illness or anything it's just you


---------57:01----------
know you had a bad situation where it


---------57:03----------
sounds like your ex-girlfriend cheated


---------57:04----------
on you and you were


---------57:06----------
breathing and unhappy and it sounds like


---------57:07----------
an appropriate


---------57:09----------
sadness to me um the interest i'm going


---------57:12----------
to get is from you


---------57:14----------
yeah i don't i don't want to hold that


---------57:16----------
fault it's going to sound crazy and i


---------57:18----------
say this to my viewers all the time


---------57:20----------
but i really do believe i've never done


---------57:22----------
cocaine and i've never i've only smoked


---------57:25----------
marijuana twice in california i'm not a


---------57:27----------
drunk i'd like to get drunk i don't


---------57:29----------
i have a cupboard stashed with alcohol i


---------57:31----------
don't touch it i'm not craving it i


---------57:33----------
never have never will


---------57:34----------
but the thing is i really do think i've


---------57:36----------
got a healthy diet and i


---------57:37----------
think and i don't want to make people


---------57:39----------
think i've got the biggest ego but i


---------57:41----------
think


---------57:41----------
i'm an example of the perfect human


---------57:43----------
being and when people see me all happy


---------57:46----------
they think oh you're bipolar because


---------57:47----------
you're way too happy or you're way too


---------57:48----------
loud or you're way too confident you're


---------57:50----------
bipolar i don't think i am i think i'm


---------57:51----------
an example of a perfect human being we


---------57:53----------
said people think oh look at this guy


---------57:54----------
he's got a huge ego he must be bipolar


---------57:56----------
so people just can't understand me


---------57:58----------
because i'm i don't


---------58:00----------
drug my body i don't i look after i work


---------58:02----------
out


---------58:03----------
and uh i just want to share of you i


---------58:05----------
really do believe to myself


---------58:06----------
i'm an example of what everyone should


---------58:08----------
be like a healthy minded positive


---------58:11----------
thinking person


---------58:12----------
and that's just what i feel so i i also


---------58:14----------
don't think i'm bipolar


---------58:15----------
enough that you're telling me well


---------58:17----------
you're what do you think this would be


---------58:18----------
survived by bipolar


---------58:19----------
for sure i don't know if you're bipolar


---------58:21----------
or not i was definitely i was definitely


---------58:22----------
definitely


---------58:23----------
looking i came in i got battle twitch i


---------58:25----------
went into that psychiatrist


---------58:26----------
angry looking for any answer why am i


---------58:29----------
like this why am i


---------58:31----------
and she diagnosed me within two hours


---------58:33----------
which is way too short for a diagnosis


---------58:34----------
in my opinion and on top of that do you


---------58:36----------
know what they did to my driver's


---------58:37----------
license


---------58:38----------
they they made it from like a 20-year


---------58:40----------
license to like a one-year license we


---------58:41----------
have to renew every year


---------58:43----------
so i go back to the doctors and i'm like


---------58:46----------
take that bipolar off my record right


---------58:48----------
now and they're like we can't do that


---------58:49----------
sir


---------58:50----------
it's like cancer once it's on the record


---------58:52----------
it's on there for life i was like oh


---------58:53----------
we'll take it off


---------58:54----------
because i don't want my driver's license


---------58:55----------
revoked every year so they've now made


---------58:57----------
it a three-year license so every three


---------58:58----------
years i've got to get tested


---------59:00----------
to make sure i'm i'm fit enough to draw


---------59:03----------
allie let me just be very clear i i'm


---------59:06----------
not removing bipolar from your chart


---------59:08----------
because i don't really know if you're


---------59:09----------
bipolar or not all i'm saying is that


---------59:12----------
so far i think a lot of times people


---------59:14----------
confuse something called emotional


---------59:16----------
ability with bipolar disorder right


---------59:19----------
and and bipolar disorder is a period is


---------59:22----------
really characterized by weeks or


---------59:24----------
months of feeling a particular mood


---------59:27----------
level


---------59:28----------
yeah and then you switch for once again


---------59:31----------
weeks to months


---------59:32----------
i still now what i'm hearing from you is


---------59:34----------
that and


---------59:35----------
and i i get what you're saying about you


---------59:37----------
know being a perfect human being


---------59:39----------
but what i'm what i'm hearing from you


---------59:40----------
is that you're a perfect human


---------59:42----------
you're a perfect human being some of the


---------59:44----------
time


---------59:46----------
right did i say that no


---------59:49----------
but that's what i'm guessing um


---------59:53----------
well in the past few months with my


---------59:54----------
streaming streaming and all that


---------59:56----------
effort's


---------59:57----------
fantastic like i've got everything that


---------59:58----------
i want in life so i'm always


---------60:00----------
high you understand yeah so what happens


---------60:03----------
when you don't have something that you


---------60:04----------
have in life


---------60:05----------
like my twitch channel my twitch channel


---------60:10----------
that i told you it was the worst doc


---------60:14----------
never get yourself banned on twitch i


---------60:16----------
you


---------60:17----------
yeah uh i could explain i couldn't i


---------60:20----------
could it brings back


---------60:22----------
like that i i need do you know what it


---------60:24----------
is the attention


---------60:25----------
it's i'm at a party i you know what it's


---------60:28----------
it's a race


---------60:29----------
right now we're in a race 100 meter


---------60:30----------
sprint all these streamers are lining up


---------60:32----------
and i'm in the race


---------60:33----------
before that a channel i'm not in that


---------60:35----------
race i've got to sit from the sidelines


---------60:36----------
that's what it's like i can't compete so


---------60:39----------
so that that's what concerns me a little


---------60:41----------
bit is that like so if we


---------60:42----------
if okay let me just can i think for a


---------60:44----------
second before while i


---------60:45----------
collect my thoughts okay i'm gonna view


---------60:47----------
and put the kettle on


---------60:56----------
i'm all is yeah i'm just thinking


---------61:01----------
i love what you do doc gotta say as you


---------61:03----------
think love what you do


---------61:05----------
best stream i'll tell you


---------61:08----------
thanks ally i appreciate that man


---------61:18----------
yeah so ali here's the really confusing


---------61:21----------
thing


---------61:23----------
so i i i think i think a lot of what you


---------61:26----------
say


---------61:27----------
makes a lot of sense i don't disagree


---------61:29----------
with you really much at all i think that


---------61:31----------
you


---------61:32----------
um i'm not surprised that i love that


---------61:36----------
um i i'm not surprised that many women


---------61:39----------
want more of a relationship with you


---------61:41----------
than


---------61:41----------
you want with them i i don't think that


---------61:45----------
uh i think that you've discovered a


---------61:47----------
couple of really important things about


---------61:49----------
your mood and diet and things like that


---------61:52----------
um and i i do think that at times you


---------61:54----------
have um


---------61:55----------
you know a really wonderful energy about


---------61:57----------
you uh


---------61:58----------
you know you're positive you're


---------62:00----------
charismatic you're funny you're a good


---------62:02----------
storyteller


---------62:03----------
all those things are great um the thing


---------62:06----------
yeah yeah yeah there's a there's the


---------62:08----------
other shoe coming so get ready for it


---------62:12----------
so so here's the only thing that really


---------62:14----------
concerns me ali is that that it seems


---------62:16----------
like a lot of this stuff is dependent


---------62:19----------
on things outside of your control so


---------62:22----------
this is what's really interesting is


---------62:23----------
that you know when i ask you about


---------62:25----------
it you know why are you feeling so good


---------62:28----------
about yourself i think you've discovered


---------62:29----------
a couple things that absolutely are in


---------62:31----------
your control right


---------62:32----------
so your diet staying positive waking up


---------62:35----------
every day and saying okay i'm going to


---------62:36----------
focus on stream and then stream kind of


---------62:38----------
does well


---------62:39----------
and like reinforces you so it's kind of


---------62:41----------
interesting because you're


---------62:42----------
you're you're like i think you're


---------62:45----------
halfway i mean i i agree with you


---------62:49----------
a hundred percent but i i feel like


---------62:51----------
something's missing there's something


---------62:52----------
incomplete


---------62:54----------
and i think what this comes back to is


---------62:56----------
is sort of this idea of like attention


---------62:58----------
seeking


---------62:58----------
and that's the best way i'm gonna


---------63:00----------
describe it is that it seems to me


---------63:03----------
um ali that a lot of the way that you


---------63:05----------
feel is dependent on your circumstances


---------63:09----------
so like when yeah for example like today


---------63:11----------
when my daughter had a bit of a


---------63:12----------
temperature and she couldn't go to


---------63:13----------
school i couldn't stream i was


---------63:15----------
really upset i was so frustrated and


---------63:17----------
flustered


---------63:18----------
and i'm so oh and i was sitting there


---------63:20----------
going my fans are going to kill me


---------63:21----------
they're going to think i'm lying


---------63:22----------
you know i'm ditching yeah good example


---------63:25----------
and you're right


---------63:26----------
yeah now i'll keep going i'm listening


---------63:28----------
yeah so so


---------63:29----------
you know if we think about 10 year old


---------63:31----------
you that that um


---------63:33----------
when your teacher says okay kids


---------63:34----------
everyone take your seats and then you


---------63:35----------
say [ __ ] you miss


---------63:37----------
and then everyone laughs then you feel


---------63:40----------
amazing right


---------63:41----------
can i just go back a second yeah i would


---------63:43----------
be more like cheeky i i


---------63:44----------
you know i said that but back in school


---------63:46----------
i would say like when i was 10 11 12


---------63:48----------
you could ask anybody went to my school


---------63:50----------
i'd say miss i've woke up miss you got


---------63:52----------
really nice tits today


---------63:53----------
i should go ally get out right now and


---------63:55----------
she would laugh but i would go out so it


---------63:57----------
wasn't like a toxic


---------63:58----------
it was like a yeah i was yeah but go on


---------64:01----------
carry on i don't want to come across as


---------64:02----------
like a toxic but go on


---------64:04----------
no yeah so so i i don't


---------64:08----------
i i'm just noticing that i think a lot


---------64:10----------
of what your mood or


---------64:12----------
just how you feel about yourself and a


---------64:13----------
lot of your positivity


---------64:15----------
seems to be dependent on


---------64:18----------
certain aspects of the outside world and


---------64:20----------
especially


---------64:21----------
like sort of the esteem of other people


---------64:25----------
and that you know if if things are going


---------64:27----------
well on twitch or you're able to stream


---------64:29----------
or stuff like that you feel really good


---------64:30----------
about yourself


---------64:31----------
but if you're kind of isolated if you're


---------64:33----------
back to being like the kid that you were


---------64:35----------
when you were growing up where you were


---------64:36----------
sort of like


---------64:37----------
you know people sort of didn't treat you


---------64:38----------
with respect and stuff like that


---------64:40----------
it kind of makes it so you kind of


---------64:44----------
don't feel so good about yourself which


---------64:46----------
is normal right so like we respond


---------64:49----------
um to how we get treated


---------64:53----------
yeah i'm with you you're right but is


---------64:54----------
that a bad thing though


---------64:57----------
is it like no i mean everyone's like me


---------65:00----------
so so


---------65:01----------
everyone's like that right so if people


---------65:03----------
make fun of me then i'm gonna feel bad


---------65:04----------
about myself


---------65:05----------
and if if people treat me well i'm gonna


---------65:07----------
feel good about myself


---------65:09----------
i think some people are more or less


---------65:12----------
responsive to the esteem of others


---------65:17----------
okay right so so what i'm curious about


---------65:20----------
and i


---------65:21----------
and this is the thing is i think when


---------65:22----------
you're positive i can see why people


---------65:24----------
sort of would


---------65:25----------
use the term bipolar to describe you


---------65:27----------
because


---------65:28----------
it seems to me that you know a lot of


---------65:30----------
times you're like you're


---------65:32----------
as you put it a perfect human being um


---------65:35----------
and and you know pardon me ally but i i


---------65:37----------
don't think that you're


---------65:39----------
uh i i don't think you're enlightened or


---------65:41----------
something like the buddha or


---------65:42----------
christ or anyone like that so i i don't


---------65:44----------
think you're actually perfect


---------65:46----------
i think you're perfect the way you are


---------65:48----------
um


---------65:49----------
and at the same time i wonder like when


---------65:51----------
you're feeling less than perfect like


---------65:53----------
what does that look like and where does


---------65:54----------
that come from


---------65:56----------
and how do you buffer yourself


---------66:00----------
how do you okay i'm gonna tell you now


---------66:03----------
i am addicted to feeling good and


---------66:06----------
looking good


---------66:06----------
addicted so much addicted that about two


---------66:09----------
years ago


---------66:10----------
someone changed the forehead emote to a


---------66:13----------
free head emote


---------66:14----------
right you know when some brits on


---------66:16----------
british talks and the whole chat spam's


---------66:17----------
free head


---------66:18----------
my teeth were scuffed before right i


---------66:21----------
when people started smacking free head


---------66:22----------
to me


---------66:23----------
i went and got my teeth knocked out by a


---------66:25----------
dentist and got fake teeth put in like


---------66:27----------
you see my teeth now


---------66:28----------
they're all fake let me get up there but


---------66:31----------
and let me tell you why


---------66:32----------
right because number one i'm insecure as


---------66:34----------
hell not anymore i used to be


---------66:35----------
since i've changed everything i know i


---------66:37----------
look like yeah i'm not scared anymore


---------66:38----------
but look you see that


---------66:39----------
they're not real okay yeah now because


---------66:41----------
they were all scuffed before but let me


---------66:42----------
tell you this as well


---------66:43----------
so much so and i mentioned my dad's


---------66:45----------
turkish that my


---------66:47----------
viewer base grew of me having a big bent


---------66:49----------
nose i thought it was big


---------66:50----------
it was bent it was like a witch it was


---------66:53----------
like have you played the sims


---------66:54----------

---------66:56----------

---------66:57----------

---------67:05----------
was like oh my god that guy's got a huge


---------67:07----------

---------68:12----------
dependent on


---------68:13----------
external things right the way that you


---------68:16----------
feel about yourself

right right but that's then you're right


---------68:20----------
go on carry on


---------68:21----------
no go for it you want to say something


---------68:24----------
and i won't lie i don't know this is why


---------68:25----------

---------68:26----------
question i've got myself i've done one


---------68:28----------
like this


---------68:28----------

---------69:01----------
but you'd look at it and think why there


---------69:04----------
are there are 23 women that


---------69:06----------
get a taste of it and want more right so


---------69:08----------
right


---------69:09----------
so either way my point is i don't know


---------69:12----------
this one i know myself really well but i


---------69:14----------
don't know why i'm so addicted to


---------69:16----------
materialistic things i always


---------69:18----------
how does it make you feel to have that


---------69:20----------
it annoys me


---------69:22----------
i told you this it angers me so much


---------69:24----------
when i see all these streamers that are


---------69:26----------
millionaires


---------69:27----------
and they don't even they don't


---------69:30----------
show their communities what they've what


---------69:31----------
what their viewers have bought them it


---------69:32----------
annoys me it makes me


---------69:34----------
angry i don't know why i get some people


---------69:35----------
to be private for their own security i


---------69:37----------
get that


---------69:38----------
but for me every time if i'm going to


---------69:40----------
build something i want to say guys


---------69:41----------
you bought me this and so right now


---------69:44----------
we're going to buy a house and i can't


---------69:45----------
wait to move in i can't wait to show my


---------69:46----------
viewers to a


---------69:47----------
store like you guys got me this and i


---------69:49----------
just said i've got something wrong with


---------69:50----------
me there


---------69:51----------
so how did it make you feel when i


---------69:52----------
bought that car do you want to know the


---------69:53----------
truth yeah


---------69:54----------
okay so the first i bought that car i


---------69:56----------
felt amazing it felt great i showed


---------69:58----------
everyone i felt on top of the world


---------70:00----------
the next day doc and it still feels the


---------70:02----------
same way i


---------70:03----------
don't i don't even feel like i own the


---------70:05----------
car it feels like it's not even there


---------70:06----------
i'm like i want my house now


---------70:08----------
i want a dual garage with a driveway


---------70:10----------
with a gated with gates i want security


---------70:12----------
i want a cctv i want big girls i want a


---------70:15----------
i want my friends with me i want my dad


---------70:17----------
for me i want a big house just to say


---------70:18----------
that


---------70:19----------
also to say to my ex and this is about


---------70:20----------
moving on but it's just


---------70:22----------
i want it to all the girls i've ever


---------70:23----------
dated to say haha [ __ ] you


---------70:25----------
look what you could have got it's like


---------70:27----------
bragging rights i i'm not i don't choose


---------70:29----------
to be like that


---------70:30----------
but that's how i feel so maybe there is


---------70:32----------
a second one with me you can tell me


---------70:33----------
why am i like this


---------70:40----------
yeah let me let me just think about how


---------70:42----------
to answer that oh good


---------70:47----------
so allie what i'm noticing is that like


---------70:49----------
so you've got this car right it's an


---------70:51----------
awesome car fantastic oh i've got a


---------70:54----------
super


---------70:54----------
okay go on okay so and and i


---------70:58----------
i think it like it makes sense that you


---------70:59----------
know you're happy and you want to share


---------71:01----------
that with your viewers because you're


---------71:02----------
the viewers of the ones that enabled you


---------71:04----------
to get that car like totally makes sense


---------71:05----------
right


---------71:06----------
it makes me feel really good when i'm


---------71:07----------
out going to bars and clubs and


---------71:09----------
hotels and i'm pulling up in the best


---------71:11----------
car they're like hahaha


---------71:13----------
wankers yeah not a sounding mature but


---------71:16----------
we're going to get everyone out on the


---------71:17----------
table now


---------71:18----------
is this a problem of mine i it's how i


---------71:20----------
feel i don't know why i'm like what i


---------71:21----------
think


---------71:22----------
why like this i think so i think it is a


---------71:24----------
problem


---------71:26----------
as a poor kid i was brought up i didn't


---------71:27----------
get any pocket money we lived in a


---------71:29----------
caravan


---------71:30----------
a cat and guess what my mom still lives


---------71:32----------
in the caravan like proper


---------71:33----------
proper eight mile a


---------71:37----------
m m yeah i'm not joking


---------71:41----------
okay i never had my own bedroom


---------71:44----------
bedroom for my sisters yeah i'm gonna


---------71:47----------
say something it's gonna be a little bit


---------71:48----------
judgmental okay do it and i think we


---------71:52----------
sort of we got


---------71:53----------
to this in the first few minutes but so


---------71:55----------
you're making up


---------71:57----------
for being a shy kid who didn't have his


---------72:01----------
own bedroom


---------72:01----------
grew up in a caravan with bad teeth and


---------72:04----------
a mom who


---------72:05----------
slept around and and now to make


---------72:08----------
that like on the inside that kid is


---------72:11----------
there


---------72:12----------
and so the more that you make yourself


---------72:14----------
perfect on the outside


---------72:16----------
the more you get your t3 done get your


---------72:19----------
nose done


---------72:20----------
dye your hair drive a fancy car the more


---------72:23----------
you can ignore forget or no longer be


---------72:28----------
that kid i'm not going to cry but yeah i


---------72:32----------
think that i think you're right is


---------72:33----------
you've just blown my mind


---------72:34----------
i think you're damn right i hated that


---------72:36----------
me yeah


---------72:38----------
you got it and i'm not yeah i'm not


---------72:39----------
ashamed of that i'm not i'm actually


---------72:41----------
more proud of you i


---------72:42----------
am now i'm more proud of who i am now


---------72:44----------
than that i'm like that's definitely not


---------72:45----------
me


---------72:46----------
but yeah you you yeah but but so but tha


---------72:48----------
so here's here's the problem right so


---------72:50----------
ali you


---------72:54----------
you try so hard to not be that kid


---------72:57----------
which makes sense and at the same time


---------73:01----------
like i don't think there's anything


---------73:02----------
wrong with that kid


---------73:04----------
right that kid like he's just he did the


---------73:07----------
best that he could given the


---------73:09----------
circumstances that he had


---------73:11----------
and like sure that kid can grow into


---------73:14----------
like


---------73:14----------
a successful man who takes care of


---------73:17----------
himself


---------73:18----------
and like eats properly and goes out of


---------73:20----------
his way to take care of his daughter and


---------73:21----------
like is an awesome dad


---------73:23----------
and streams on twitch and tries to


---------73:26----------
provide positivity to people and give


---------73:28----------
back


---------73:29----------
and and you don't have to be ashamed of


---------73:31----------
that kid


---------73:32----------
the reason i think this stuff is bad ali


---------73:34----------
is because when you buy the jaguar you


---------73:36----------
feel awesome for a day


---------73:38----------
and then the next day it's like what's


---------73:40----------
next yeah


---------73:42----------
yeah yeah yeah right yeah and so you get


---------73:44----------
a nose job


---------73:45----------
and then you feel amazing and then it's


---------73:47----------
like oh [ __ ] i got to get my teeth done


---------73:49----------
next time yep yep yep all my viewers


---------73:51----------
know that that's


---------73:52----------
i or they ah yeah you've now there and


---------73:54----------
also as my daughter let me say this


---------73:57----------
my dad wasn't there for me my i wish my


---------73:59----------
dad was there for me i always wanted my


---------74:01----------
dad to turn up to school


---------74:02----------
and to see me and i wanted always i


---------74:04----------
always want to spend days with my dad i


---------74:06----------
always wanted


---------74:07----------
my dad to come to school to pick me up


---------74:08----------
in his car he had the same car


---------74:10----------
i've currently got the supra and i


---------74:12----------
always wanted that but he never did


---------74:14----------
and that's why when i talk to her school


---------74:15----------
now i'm the best parent there and all


---------74:17----------
the kids look at me and they wish that i


---------74:18----------
was that i was the dad and all the proud


---------74:20----------
parents look at me and i'm like


---------74:21----------
but yeah so i'm being the dad that my


---------74:23----------
dad want there for me


---------74:24----------
i'm being that dad for her and yeah


---------74:26----------
that's the truth


---------74:28----------
um but yeah you're nailing this you're


---------74:30----------
really good at what you do


---------74:31----------
but i'm really tough i'm crying on the


---------74:33----------
inside but i'm not going to shot on the


---------74:35----------
outside i'm not going to do it


---------74:36----------
but yeah right so there it is again


---------74:38----------
because because what you see


---------74:40----------
what you s what we see on the outside is


---------74:43----------
so important to you


---------74:46----------
right is that bad though it's not


---------74:49----------
i generally speaking i i hope you don't


---------74:53----------
stay that way i think it's fine


---------74:55----------
we're all that way and then the question


---------74:57----------
is do we want to be a different way


---------74:59----------
because he let me put it to you this way


---------75:01----------
ali you're you're gonna you're gonna


---------75:02----------
model like your daughter's gonna learn a


---------75:04----------
lot from you


---------75:05----------
okay and so do you wanna teach her that


---------75:08----------
if her nose doesn't look perfect


---------75:10----------
she has less value as a human being no


---------75:13----------
but i'll be paying for a nose drop if


---------75:14----------
she wants it but


---------75:16----------
ask me a question again sorry ask me the


---------75:18----------
question so like


---------75:19----------
i've already thought about this if her


---------75:20----------
nose comes out anything like my old nose


---------75:22----------
because in genetics or any of my kids


---------75:24----------
i ordered those jobs are on me for free


---------75:25----------
it's like it's like that's


---------75:27----------
just standard go on ask me the same


---------75:29----------
question again because yeah i mean what


---------75:30----------
do you want to teach her


---------75:31----------
about her worth what is her worth


---------75:34----------
dependent on


---------75:35----------
i want her to i don't want her to be a


---------75:37----------
twitch streamer like me i want her to


---------75:38----------
actually have an education go through


---------75:39----------
uni and be


---------75:40----------
something to change the world don't


---------75:42----------
press that button don't you dare press


---------75:43----------
that button


---------75:44----------
um yeah so what's okay so do i want to


---------75:47----------
be like me in that way


---------75:48----------
well i just want her to be i'm just


---------75:51----------
gonna let her be


---------75:52----------
the woman she wants to be and i'm just


---------75:55----------
if saying


---------75:56----------
if she starts being a bit weird or i'd


---------75:59----------
just say


---------76:00----------
is that who you are if that's who you


---------76:02----------
want to be be


---------76:03----------
that because life's not hard dark i want


---------76:05----------
to be honest with you if any viewers


---------76:07----------
watching this is what i've learned


---------76:09----------
if you want to be that guy it takes a


---------76:12----------
mini second in your brain to be that guy


---------76:14----------
for the rest of your life


---------76:15----------
if you want to be a dick of a person you


---------76:17----------
can just be a dick and you're that dick


---------76:19----------
person so


---------76:20----------
if you want to be a nice person be it it


---------76:22----------
takes a second


---------76:23----------
to be that person and that's the truth


---------76:25----------
so um


---------76:27----------
what's my point with my daughter i'm


---------76:29----------
gonna let her sculpture herself


---------76:31----------
but if there is ever a concern or a bit


---------76:33----------
like that's a bit weird


---------76:35----------
what you're doing i might say are you


---------76:36----------
sure you're sure sure


---------76:38----------
i mean that's your job i'm never going


---------76:41----------
to be a parent where i'm making them but


---------76:42----------
you know you've got


---------76:43----------
strict parents out there that make them


---------76:45----------
wear that certain amount of that clothes


---------76:47----------
or where that or they're going to be and


---------76:48----------
she's going to be


---------76:49----------
a free bird and i'll pray she makes the


---------76:51----------
right decisions


---------76:52----------
okay guys let me let go on so


---------76:56----------
allie let me try to i'm going to try to


---------76:57----------
explain this you asked me is that bad so


---------76:59----------
let me put it to you this way so like


---------77:02----------
let's take your ex-girlfriend right so


---------77:04----------
one day you woke up


---------77:05----------
and you no longer hated her now does


---------77:08----------
that


---------77:08----------
lack of hate


---------77:12----------
so hatred can kind of come from two


---------77:14----------
places like


---------77:15----------
like maybe the reason uh how can i this


---------77:17----------
is sorry i i gotta take a step back


---------77:20----------
i use that even to this day i use that


---------77:23----------
as an energy the reason i came popular


---------77:24----------
in 2015 to 2016 because my ex cheated on


---------77:27----------
me


---------77:27----------
and i was like [ __ ] you i'm gonna stream


---------77:30----------
make it


---------77:31----------
just to piss you off and i use that


---------77:32----------
energy and that transformed the song


---------77:34----------
perfect


---------77:35----------
and then after half a year when i was


---------77:36----------
over i had this perfect thing going on


---------77:38----------
so use it as an energy


---------77:39----------
yeah yeah so so i think that's great and


---------77:42----------
at the same time i still feel like it


---------77:44----------
kind of comes back to this idea that


---------77:46----------
it's not


---------77:46----------
dependent on you it's dependent on the


---------77:48----------
outside world


---------77:51----------
right like if you're doing things to


---------77:53----------
show people


---------77:54----------
that they're wankers and that you've


---------77:56----------
made it and all those kids that bullied


---------77:58----------
you on school look at ali now like


---------78:00----------
ally's got


---------78:01----------
beautiful teeth beautiful nose beautiful


---------78:03----------
hair beautiful [ __ ]


---------78:04----------
you know he's got he's got everything


---------78:06----------
now like who's making fun of who


---------78:09----------
and and and sure i mean that can feel


---------78:11----------
good


---------78:12----------
for a while but generally speaking in my


---------78:14----------
experience


---------78:15----------
happiness that comes from the outside is


---------78:18----------
temporary and also depends


---------78:20----------
on the outside and that there's


---------78:23----------
there's another kind of happiness that


---------78:25----------
comes sort of from within


---------78:27----------
for lack of a better term and and i i


---------78:30----------
think that you've probably you've


---------78:31----------
undoubtedly had this right like where


---------78:33----------
it's it's not


---------78:34----------
i mean i think that there are parts of


---------78:36----------
you that feel really good about


---------78:38----------
yourselves because of the kind of dad


---------78:39----------
that you


---------78:40----------
are but it's not because anyone is


---------78:43----------
seeing like your daughter doesn't even


---------78:44----------
know


---------78:45----------
what you're doing for her right there's


---------78:48----------
no outside


---------78:49----------
reinforcement or support of your esteem


---------78:52----------
or worth


---------78:53----------
it's something that like you wake up in


---------78:54----------
the morning and you say like okay she's


---------78:56----------
got a fever today so she can't


---------78:58----------
i'm gonna be pissed about it but i'm not


---------78:59----------
gonna get mad at her it's not her fault


---------79:02----------
and she's never gonna know that she's


---------79:03----------
never gonna thank you for it


---------79:05----------
no one's ever gonna say like oh like


---------79:07----------
look at ali he's such a good dad like he


---------79:09----------
stayed home and canceled his stream


---------79:10----------
in fact if anything you're you may get


---------79:12----------
the opposite where your


---------79:14----------
your viewers may be like upset your


---------79:16----------
community may be upset oh this guy's


---------79:18----------
flaking again


---------79:19----------
but but like all that stuff even from


---------79:21----------
the outside you're gonna get


---------79:22----------
no reinforcement and maybe even some


---------79:26----------
amount of flack


---------79:27----------
or hatred or you know trolling or


---------79:30----------
whatever


---------79:30----------
but you can still feel good about


---------79:32----------
yourself regardless of how the outside


---------79:35----------
world treats you


---------79:36----------
i think that is better than the way you


---------79:40----------
feel


---------79:40----------
being dependent on how the outside world


---------79:44----------
treats you


---------79:46----------
and at the end of the day ali i hate to


---------79:47----------
break it to you man but if you hadn't


---------79:49----------
gotten a nose


---------79:50----------
job i don't think i would think any less


---------79:52----------
or more of you


---------79:53----------
i think what makes you amazing is not


---------79:55----------
your nose


---------79:57----------
right it's it's your like your drive to


---------80:00----------
like


---------80:00----------
be better and your ability to like roll


---------80:04----------
with punches


---------80:06----------
but but like the the the nose the nose


---------80:09----------
changes the way that you perceive


---------80:11----------
yourself


---------80:16----------
right


---------80:20----------
man that's so nice of you oh man that's


---------80:24----------
you're so i really believe that you're


---------80:26----------
like


---------80:27----------
an angel or something to speak words of


---------80:31----------
wisdom to people honest to god


---------80:33----------
um i know what you're saying though and


---------80:36----------
get it you're trying to say


---------80:37----------
you don't need all this because you can


---------80:40----------
be you're


---------80:41----------
you're loved on the inside alley you're


---------80:42----------
trying to say that but what if i told


---------80:44----------
you


---------80:44----------
it's like venom the movie and spider-man


---------80:47----------
3


---------80:48----------
where eddie brock is like and he's like


---------80:50----------
eddie don't don't take the suit it's bad


---------80:52----------
and he's like yeah i like being bad


---------80:54----------
it feels good right now it feels good


---------80:56----------
being this


---------80:58----------
outside


---------81:03----------
here's here's the problem i completely


---------81:05----------
agree with you that it feels amazing


---------81:07----------
right now right so it's like a problem


---------81:11----------
is this what we want to like step back a


---------81:13----------
bit because you're going to get no so so


---------81:15----------
here's the thing


---------81:16----------
if you if the reason you feel amazing


---------81:18----------
right now is because your twitch career


---------81:20----------
is going well because everything is


---------81:21----------
going well you just bought a


---------81:23----------
car you're going to buy a house like


---------81:25----------
like if everything


---------81:26----------
if your happiness is tied to the outside


---------81:28----------
world and what the faiths give you


---------81:31----------
then it's tied to what the faiths give


---------81:33----------
you


---------81:34----------
right right and so what i'm asking you


---------81:37----------
to do


---------81:38----------
is consider a life where your happiness


---------81:41----------
is not tied


---------81:42----------
to what the fates give you but it's like


---------81:45----------
like buddhas do that don't know they


---------81:47----------
don't have any of that they just sit in


---------81:48----------
the mountains and they they just have


---------81:50----------
each other


---------81:50----------
so like that sort of that's like


---------81:52----------
obviously live stream


---------81:54----------
so i don't know go on yeah so


---------81:57----------
okay my question is how am i meant to


---------81:58----------
find happy my question is how am i meant


---------82:00----------
to find happiness


---------82:02----------
without having goals and things to show


---------82:04----------
for in the real world


---------82:05----------
you tell me okay great so close your


---------82:08----------
eyes


---------82:11----------
and if my daughter comes in the top of


---------82:12----------
pc just scream okay


---------82:14----------
so ally


---------82:18----------
what's wrong with you right now


---------82:23----------
can i respond yeah nothing


---------82:26----------
okay then why do you need anything


---------82:29----------
right right


---------82:33----------
well all i want to know is one answer


---------82:35----------
for you how can i be happy


---------82:37----------
will you tell you told me i can be happy


---------82:40----------
on the inside rather than the outside


---------82:42----------
world so you tell me how i could be


---------82:43----------
happy or how you'd demonstrate to anyone


---------82:45----------
else


---------82:45----------
how i'd be happy with the inside not the


---------82:48----------
outside yeah yeah so so but what


---------82:49----------
what do you what but so it there's


---------82:52----------
nothing wrong with you right


---------82:53----------
right shuffle like i still want about


---------82:56----------
whatever you prefer


---------82:56----------
she's coming okay okay okay yeah


---------83:01----------
okay yeah go on so so yeah so but ali


---------83:04----------
here's the thing right so like like if


---------83:05----------
you think


---------83:06----------
about why you want something in the


---------83:08----------
outside world


---------83:09----------
that comes from a desire within you


---------83:15----------
right so is it outside the is the inside


---------83:17----------
of me is the outside of me right


---------83:18----------
absolutely


---------83:20----------
brilliantly put right so like this is


---------83:24----------
where so like right now you feel


---------83:26----------
perfectly content and so so


---------83:29----------
then what's gonna happen is at some


---------83:31----------
point you're not gonna be content


---------83:33----------
something within you is going to say i


---------83:35----------
want a house or i want a car


---------83:38----------
right and then why can't i why can't i


---------83:41----------
keep just chasing that for the rest of


---------83:42----------
my life that's what gives people


---------83:43----------
like goals isn't it it's like they get


---------83:44----------
one goal fantastic feel great want the


---------83:46----------
next one but that's life we have to work


---------83:48----------
hard and have goals am i wrong or


---------83:50----------
i think you have to work hard but but i


---------83:52----------
i don't i mean


---------83:53----------
yeah goals so that gets tricky for a


---------83:56----------
second but let me take a step back and


---------83:58----------
ask you


---------83:58----------
uh we'll talk about that in a second but


---------84:00----------
let me just point this out so like right


---------84:02----------
now you're perfectly content you don't


---------84:03----------
want anything right


---------84:05----------
but one day and all the stuff but yeah


---------84:08----------
but so but how do you feel


---------84:09----------
you don't have a house so how do you


---------84:11----------
feel right now


---------84:13----------
yeah incomplete okay where does that


---------84:17----------
sound comfortable where does that


---------84:18----------
feeling of incompleteness come from


---------84:20----------
i don't own a house yeah so so what what


---------84:24----------
is that


---------84:27----------
security but no inside you


---------84:30----------
ally i know it's kind of a weird baby


---------84:32----------
shark dude it's legit


---------84:34----------
yeah um but what what is that feeling of


---------84:38----------
incompleteness


---------84:39----------
what does that feel like right so like


---------84:41----------
your knowledge that you don't have a


---------84:43----------
house


---------84:44----------
is represented inside you in some way


---------84:48----------
right right so like if you imagine


---------84:51----------
walking into your house you're gonna


---------84:55----------
feel something on the inside


---------84:59----------
when the first time you walk into a


---------85:00----------
house you're going to feel something


---------85:02----------
and until you do that there's like this


---------85:04----------
emptiness inside you right


---------85:06----------
that's right okay so like yeah


---------85:10----------
empty slash um the feeling of one


---------85:13----------
uh the chase i won't call it empty it's


---------85:16----------
like uh


---------85:18----------
what's that what's that yeah hunger yeah


---------85:21----------
what is that


---------85:21----------
yes yeah that's it it's that feeling


---------85:23----------
it's like oh it's the chase it's like


---------85:24----------
yeah yeah i'm gonna get that i want that


---------85:26----------
yeah okay that gets my stream on every


---------85:28----------
day that's why i'm a bit upset i didn't


---------85:30----------
stream but go on


---------85:30----------
okay yeah so so let's think about hunger


---------85:32----------
for a second right


---------85:34----------
because there are times where you've had


---------85:35----------
hunger for rice


---------85:39----------
sure and yeah and what happens when you


---------85:42----------
don't give in to that hunger


---------85:44----------
like when you when you when you feel


---------85:45----------
hungry for rice and you start eating it


---------85:47----------
man do you feel good right and then the


---------85:51----------
next day how do you feel


---------85:52----------
but then if you eat more rice or you


---------85:54----------
have a cake oh man like there we go


---------85:56----------
again like i feel that hunger i want it


---------85:58----------
again


---------85:58----------
i want it again i want it again i want


---------86:01----------
it again oh what's the next thing


---------86:03----------
the next thing the next thing the hunger


---------86:05----------
always comes back that's true


---------86:09----------
and the more you feed it what happens to


---------86:11----------
you


---------86:13----------
you get fake yeah right you start to


---------86:16----------
feel bad about yourself


---------86:18----------
yeah yeah so sorry yeah so so how do you


---------86:22----------
what are you doing oh no you're trying


---------86:24----------
to say that when i get this house


---------86:26----------
and i've got that hung i'm gonna be


---------86:28----------
wanting the next thing


---------86:29----------
and the next thing is that what you're


---------86:31----------
trying to say yeah


---------86:33----------
yeah but let me say this doc who's


---------86:35----------
laughing when i own five six seven eight


---------86:37----------
houses


---------86:38----------
and i'm a landlord and then my penance


---------86:40----------
who's laughing


---------86:41----------
because you could put this like this


---------86:43----------
isn't the same being a landlord's


---------86:44----------
completely different to being


---------86:46----------
huge and overweight and feeling bad do


---------86:47----------
you understand what i'm saying yeah so


---------86:49----------
so the only part that's huge and


---------86:51----------
overweight and feeling bad is your ego


---------86:53----------
when you're a landlord


---------86:54----------
right your ego gets overblown then


---------86:56----------
you're like who's laughing now


---------86:58----------
all y'all little [ __ ] and i'm a big


---------87:00----------
man look at me


---------87:02----------
i'm a ladler you're a [ __ ] tenant at


---------87:04----------
that point


---------87:05----------
your mind is obese your mind is 14 stone


---------87:09----------
your ego is 14 stone oh you think but


---------87:11----------
don't you think some people find that


---------87:13----------
attractive


---------87:14----------
of course some people find it as like


---------87:17----------
wow i want to


---------87:18----------
be like this guy he's confident yes


---------87:22----------
you know what you you attract the wrong


---------87:23----------
audience you attract the wrong type of


---------87:25----------
women that are


---------87:25----------
gold diggers and you check the wrong


---------87:27----------
front difference they're trying to


---------87:27----------
exploit you and use you i completely


---------87:29----------
know where you're coming from but i'd


---------87:30----------
rather


---------87:31----------
be that guy than be someone who's


---------87:34----------
scraping by


---------87:36----------
really struggling living anxiety that he


---------87:37----------
can't cover his rent


---------87:39----------
so you know yeah


---------87:42----------
i agree i agree you should strive for


---------87:44----------
stability


---------87:45----------
so so you should absolutely strive for


---------87:47----------
stability and i i think i think ali this


---------87:49----------
is part of your journey right like you


---------87:51----------
started off


---------87:52----------
his anxious got it getting banned from


---------87:55----------
twitch


---------87:56----------
nowhere and now you've come out of it


---------87:58----------
and then your next phase is to transcend


---------88:00----------
the entire thing to move like stop


---------88:03----------
playing the entire [ __ ] game because


---------88:05----------
when you say like who's laughing that's


---------88:06----------
ego man


---------88:07----------
like why do you need to show all of


---------88:09----------
these women that tried to control you


---------88:11----------
that like you're doing fantastic


---------88:14----------
they're living their lives and like what


---------88:16----------
why why do you want to show them


---------88:18----------
like what you're just going to cause and


---------88:20----------
pain because you're successful


---------88:21----------
let me tell you that there's something


---------88:23----------
called flexing and yeah i know


---------88:25----------
you're you're not a type of gutter flex


---------88:28----------
there's no way you are you're really


---------88:29----------
humble and lovely


---------88:30----------
and i'm glad you don't but there are


---------88:32----------
types of people a lot of people out


---------88:33----------
there


---------88:33----------
that i don't care who's watching and


---------88:36----------
who's the thing if anybody out there


---------88:37----------
can flex it feels great it feels good it


---------88:40----------
makes you feel when lying effectively


---------88:41----------
empowered and other people get inspired


---------88:43----------
by that person flexing sometimes


---------88:45----------
sure right yeah i completely agree with


---------88:48----------
you so let me ask you this


---------88:49----------
when did you first want to flex oh my


---------88:56----------
god


---------88:56----------
um


---------88:57----------
[Music]


---------89:00----------

---------89:08----------

---------89:20----------

---------90:54----------
thing about it's in it's who i am


---------90:57----------

---------90:58----------
like 10 11. not it didn't start when i


---------91:00----------

---------91:03----------
the flex is to


---------91:05----------
compensate for an instructor penis


---------91:08----------

---------91:10----------
penis okay


---------91:12----------
i swear that i swear it's i don't know


---------91:14----------
what it is that


---------91:15----------
no no no it's dude it's it's it's to


---------91:17----------
compensate for like caravan you


---------91:20----------
bad teeth you shy you who got bullied


---------91:23----------
that's true right but here's the thing


---------91:25----------
here's the thing that's not the real you


---------91:28----------
that kid isn't the real you and if that


---------91:30----------
kid isn't the real you then you have no


---------91:32----------
need to flex


---------91:35----------
right if there's nothing wrong with you


---------91:37----------
why do you need to show off or prove


---------91:38----------
anything to anyone


---------91:42----------
right


---------91:50----------
did you ask me a question no because


---------91:52----------
it's all going in


---------91:54----------
sort of you're right you're right you're


---------91:56----------
right


---------91:59----------
[Music]


---------92:02----------
you're not asking me to change you're


---------92:04----------
not you're not asking me about are you


---------92:05----------
just making me understand right


---------92:07----------
sure right do you want to change


---------92:12----------
no not one bit i just i'm understanding


---------92:15----------
more about me okay because i've always


---------92:17----------
liked this and you've helped me


---------92:18----------
understand and i'm definitely


---------92:19----------
compensating for


---------92:21----------
yeah the the old me like you said um but


---------92:24----------
i don't want to go back to that


---------92:26----------
guy i you know i love who i am now doc


---------92:28----------
i'll be honest with you like


---------92:30----------
you know yeah so ali i don't think


---------92:34----------
you are truly what you are now


---------92:37----------
and i don't think you're truly what you


---------92:39----------
were back then


---------92:41----------
right i think you are what you are and


---------92:44----------
that there's nothing wrong with it so


---------92:46----------
you don't have to prove anything to


---------92:47----------
anyone


---------92:50----------
they don't need to see they don't need


---------92:51----------
to they don't need to see who you are


---------92:54----------
because they'll never know who you are


---------93:03----------
you know like right now what does your


---------93:04----------
daughter think you are


---------93:08----------
well i hope she knows that i'm her dad


---------93:11----------
we did a dna test and she i am the dad


---------93:13----------
um


---------93:15----------
but um well she can't speak i mean i


---------93:18----------
would hope she thinks


---------93:19----------
that i'm a father yeah for sure yep


---------93:22----------
right


---------93:23----------
and that you love her and she thinks


---------93:25----------
you're awesome


---------93:26----------
she can't get we've been talking for an


---------93:29----------
hour and a half and she can't get enough


---------93:30----------
of you


---------93:31----------
right right is that because you got a


---------93:33----------
nose job


---------93:35----------
no is it because of your teeth no


---------93:38----------
is it because of your car


---------93:41----------
is it because of how many followers you


---------93:43----------
have on twitch oh


---------93:45----------
she's faint how can she like you without


---------93:49----------
any of those things


---------93:51----------
oh i see oh i see i see what you mean


---------93:55----------
oh okay right


---------93:58----------
she likes it for who i am i right


---------94:01----------
yep okay but for a two and a half year


---------94:05----------
old this is different to all the people


---------94:08----------
nowadays it's if she's different to like


---------94:09----------
a 25 year old woman


---------94:11----------
dude just just because people out there


---------94:15----------
are [ __ ] dumber than a three-year-old


---------94:17----------
does not mean you need to cater to them


---------94:19----------
right i got you


---------94:25----------
animals and kids are the ones that see


---------94:28----------
your real value


---------94:31----------
not instagram models


---------94:36----------
right so you can you can live up to


---------94:38----------
their esteem if you want to


---------94:39----------
so you're you're right ally i'm not


---------94:41----------
asking you to change it's not my place


---------94:43----------
to ask you to change


---------94:46----------
it's my place to show you or try to help


---------94:50----------
see what i think you are and in theory


---------94:53----------
maybe that's what you really are


---------94:54----------
and then you should decide right if you


---------94:58----------
want to continue chasing materialistic


---------95:00----------
things go for it


---------95:01----------
if you want to continue flexing on


---------95:02----------
people go for it but this is what i will


---------95:05----------
tell you and what i have observed


---------95:08----------
is that the more your happiness is


---------95:11----------
dependent on


---------95:12----------
other people's opinion the less in


---------95:14----------
control of your happiness you


---------95:15----------
are that makes sense


---------95:18----------
so it's like playing with fire is what


---------95:20----------
you're trying to say absolutely


---------95:23----------
so if i loved myself and who i really am


---------95:25----------
and like early like we're talking about


---------95:27----------
animals


---------95:28----------
they love who you are that's i'm not


---------95:30----------
playing with fire then that's like a


---------95:31----------
safe thing to do


---------95:32----------
right i i i safe absolutely i mean i


---------95:35----------
think that's where real happiness comes


---------95:36----------
from


---------95:37----------
sustainable happiness like you think


---------95:39----------
about how does your daughter feel about


---------95:41----------
herself


---------95:43----------
and why does she feel that way it's


---------95:44----------
because you see something within her


---------95:47----------
why does she love you so much it's


---------95:48----------
because you probably don't


---------95:50----------
treat her based on what she does on the


---------95:52----------
outside gotcha


---------95:55----------
right her mom probably treats her


---------95:57----------
differently whereas like you treat her


---------95:59----------
like a person


---------96:01----------
not like any one facet


---------96:04----------
of her being you just don't pick one


---------96:07----------
side


---------96:08----------
you treat her as a person


---------96:12----------
and my guess is that like and it's not


---------96:14----------
your fault or anything i think this is


---------96:16----------
what happens


---------96:17----------
when kids get made fun of and when you


---------96:19----------
grow up where like you grow up in a


---------96:20----------
caravan and other people have houses


---------96:22----------
you they make you feel like less of a


---------96:25----------
human being


---------96:27----------
and what i'm telling you to do is stop


---------96:29----------
playing their [ __ ] game


---------96:35----------
all right because whether you have a


---------96:37----------
house or whether you have a caravan


---------96:39----------
she's gonna see the same person does she


---------96:42----------
know that you guys have like a mansion


---------96:43----------
or an apartment or a caravan right now


---------96:45----------
she doesn't know and she doesn't care


---------96:48----------
yeah it doesn't care what color your


---------96:49----------
hair is


---------97:14----------
i don't want to say doc okay


---------97:17----------
i'm just taking it in sorry no no it's


---------97:20----------
good


---------97:21----------
i mean no it's nice hearing it though


---------97:23----------
it's you're right


---------97:24----------
it's not hearing it um what happens


---------97:27----------
though when she grows up and


---------97:31----------
um she hasn't got nice things


---------97:35----------
right and then people at school make fun


---------97:36----------
of her excellent


---------97:38----------
now we get to the important point this


---------97:40----------
is why you need to so


---------97:42----------
yeah so allie this is beautiful you took


---------97:45----------
the next point i i was made fun of in


---------97:47----------
school if i had a big nose and living in


---------97:49----------
a caravan


---------97:50----------
and people would call me all names like


---------97:52----------
yep you know what i mean


---------97:53----------
so why would i want uh that's i do a lot


---------97:56----------
of it for her i say this all the time


---------97:58----------
but i do


---------97:58----------
want her to have the best things so i'm


---------98:02----------
the cool dad when i and i i don't sound


---------98:04----------
weird here but


---------98:06----------
when she goes to school and she has uh


---------98:08----------
it's her birthday


---------98:09----------
all her friends can come stay in a big


---------98:13----------
house and have a party which i never had


---------98:15----------
did i mean i don't i'd rather have that


---------98:17----------
life rather than of life where because i


---------98:19----------
never had a birthday party


---------98:20----------
i never had loads of friends over i


---------98:21----------
didn't get that luxury


---------98:23----------
you know i mean i've already got a


---------98:24----------
sleepover and if so it was weird


---------98:27----------
but um and that's it so i want i want


---------98:29----------
her to have nice things


---------98:31----------
i don't want to get bullied


---------98:34----------
so so ali i can get behind that 100


---------98:37----------
because let me explain something to you


---------98:39----------
though so why should you work hard


---------98:42----------
working hard to flex on noobs is one


---------98:45----------
thing


---------98:46----------
for family but i do want to dismiss that


---------98:48----------
i do everything i do do


---------98:49----------
is for my daughter as well it's just a


---------98:51----------
additional it's also


---------98:53----------
for ellie it's also for


---------98:57----------
yeah i'm doing all right yeah so so so


---------99:00----------
i i think when you work hard you do so


---------99:02----------
for two children


---------99:05----------
you do so for ellie


---------99:08----------
and then you do so for 10 year old you


---------99:10----------
right


---------99:12----------
and so what i'm saying is one of those


---------99:14----------
is going to be temporary


---------99:17----------
and you're going to feel like you're


---------99:18----------
going to go back to feeling the second


---------99:20----------
you buy a nice car


---------99:21----------
and then someone that you dislike buys a


---------99:24----------
nicer car you're gonna go back to


---------99:26----------
feeling like that 10 year old kid


---------99:29----------
but should you work your ass off should


---------99:31----------
you stream every day should you try to


---------99:32----------
be bigger and better and more secure


---------99:35----------
should you become a landlord instead of


---------99:36----------
a tenant and have control over your own


---------99:38----------
destiny


---------99:39----------
absolutely it's the why that's important


---------99:43----------
are you doing it to make other people


---------99:46----------
see how big your dick is are you doing


---------99:48----------
it for your daughter


---------99:51----------
yeah i i got you i i asked me that


---------99:54----------
because


---------99:55----------
you know i mean i think you're yeah yeah


---------99:57----------
yeah and i think i think


---------99:58----------
both of them exist within you right now


---------100:00----------
that's okay it's just over the next


---------100:02----------
couple of years


---------100:03----------
you've got to decide whether you want to


---------100:06----------
chase temporary happiness because you're


---------100:08----------
damn right it feels good that's why


---------100:09----------
everyone chases it like why do you think


---------100:10----------
everyone's doing this


---------100:11----------
why do you think instagram exists it's


---------100:14----------
because temporary highs are very


---------100:16----------
addictive and so easy to attain


---------100:18----------
it's way harder to sit with that hunger


---------100:22----------
and conquer it and not give in because


---------100:24----------
it's so satisfying


---------100:26----------
when you get that bowl of white rice and


---------100:29----------
you just start shoving it in your face


---------100:31----------
man does it feel so good for that hunger


---------100:33----------
but then the hunger comes back tomorrow


---------100:36----------
yeah and then a jaguar and then a home


---------100:38----------
but why do you want a home


---------100:41----------
is it because you want to flex or


---------100:43----------
because you don't you want to be able to


---------100:45----------
have a party for everybody


---------100:47----------
i've got a massive thing and this is


---------100:50----------
getting a bit to know me when i was a


---------100:53----------
kid and i was growing up


---------100:54----------
my dad walked there my my mom split with


---------100:56----------
him when


---------100:57----------
she was six and one second


---------101:02----------
sorry my friends listen to the stream


---------101:03----------
and i can hear myself talking i hate my


---------101:05----------
own voice


---------101:05----------
so pretty much when i was a um when i


---------101:07----------
was a kid i um


---------101:10----------
my dad weren't there and they they he


---------101:12----------
set my mom's car on fire they broke up


---------101:15----------
right it's drugs and all that crap and


---------101:17----------
uh pretty much what happened was


---------101:20----------
uh um my mom met this fella


---------101:23----------
after a few years of dating a few guys


---------101:26----------
and um he's very old-fashioned


---------101:28----------
and the day that i left school i was a


---------101:31----------
very quiet kid


---------101:32----------
at my family at the caravan at home at


---------101:35----------
school i was a terror


---------101:37----------
so much so that my mum would get reports


---------101:39----------
that i was really loud in class and she


---------101:41----------
wouldn't believe it


---------101:42----------
she we turned up to a parent's evening


---------101:44----------
and the teachers were like ali's loud he


---------101:46----------
swears a lot and


---------101:47----------
she's like not my alley what this ally


---------101:49----------
and i would sit there like


---------101:52----------
you know so the day that i left school i


---------101:54----------

---------101:56----------
grades i came


---------101:57----------
into school i was meant to get a's and


---------102:00----------
b's


---------102:00----------

---------102:03----------
immature and flexing with


---------102:04----------
um this loud mouth potty mouth kid i


---------102:07----------
left with


---------102:07----------
all bad grades the day that i finished


---------102:10----------

---------102:13----------

---------102:16----------
the day that happened


---------102:18----------
he was like get out go and we got into a


---------102:20----------
massive fight


---------102:21----------

---------102:28----------
nosebleed you punched me in the face


---------102:30----------
she she's like live it if i when i tell


---------102:32----------
her that she doesn't want to hear


---------102:34----------
she just says no no no so i got kicked


---------102:36----------
out when i was 16.


---------102:37----------
i always got kicked out when i was 14


---------102:40----------
but i went and stayed around a friend's


---------102:41----------
house and still to this day


---------102:43----------
you no one on this stream knows knows


---------102:45----------
what it's like to live with someone and


---------102:47----------
if you do you do but


---------102:49----------
you have no idea what it's like to maybe


---------102:51----------
you do doc


---------102:52----------
to live with someone and be dependent on


---------102:54----------
them to keep you there it


---------102:56----------
i lived growing up for my teenage years


---------102:58----------
in anxiety that my stepfather's gonna


---------103:00----------
kick me out and i was so scared of him


---------103:02----------
we never talked we never interacted all


---------103:04----------
i want to do is sit down and play


---------103:05----------
runescape


---------103:06----------
and that and make youtube videos and


---------103:07----------
that guy terrified me


---------103:10----------
that still to this day i my worst fear


---------103:13----------
ever


---------103:13----------
is not being able to pay my rent


---------103:16----------
that's why every time i get a girlfriend


---------103:19----------
i get i'm like i'm paying all the rent


---------103:20----------
i'm paying all the bills i'm paying


---------103:22----------
everything everything's on me i won't


---------103:23----------
let you spend a penny because i don't


---------103:25----------
want anyone to feel that anxiety which i


---------103:27----------
felt


---------103:28----------
growing up i hate no one there might be


---------103:30----------
someone watching this stream like a


---------103:32----------
16 year old who's doesn't know what's


---------103:33----------
going to do with leave school it's the


---------103:35----------
worst


---------103:35----------
feeling in the world living with someone


---------103:37----------
and being scared they're going to kick


---------103:38----------
you out


---------103:39----------
because it's just the worst feeling in


---------103:40----------
the world and now i had that i used to


---------103:42----------
clean up


---------103:43----------
be really polite was quite quiet and


---------103:45----------
scared


---------103:46----------
and still just to have that anxiety


---------103:48----------
that's why now i want to buy


---------103:50----------
a house if not houses and i want to own


---------103:52----------
so it's like a


---------103:53----------
security like hey i'm never gonna if if


---------103:57----------
if if [ __ ] hits the fan i'm okay because


---------103:58----------
i bought these houses and i could sell


---------104:00----------
them and live off that for a while


---------104:02----------
and that's it doc so that is so it's not


---------104:04----------
so much the reason i want to buy a house


---------104:06----------
is number one


---------104:07----------
yes it's my dual size well number two


---------104:10----------
it's it feel makes you feel good i


---------104:12----------
own a house but number three mostly it's


---------104:14----------
security


---------104:15----------
do you understand it's that i have this


---------104:17----------
living anxiety i'm so scared that's why


---------104:20----------
now i the past three years i haven't


---------104:23----------
streamed i've just been living anxiety


---------104:25----------
because i was too scared to stream with


---------104:26----------
my fan base


---------104:27----------
but now all i want to do is stream every


---------104:29----------
day i would stream 30 days


---------104:30----------
a week a month if i could but with with


---------104:33----------
my daughter i can't but um either way


---------104:35----------
that's the truth so


---------104:36----------
that it you know that anxiety is still


---------104:39----------
there and


---------104:40----------
all my last girlfriend i let her live


---------104:42----------
here


---------104:43----------
and the problem with me we're human


---------104:46----------
beings


---------104:46----------
we can find negatives in the most


---------104:48----------
positive thing for example


---------104:50----------
i did not pay anything i paid her car


---------104:53----------
insurance i paid all for


---------104:54----------
all her food her clothes you name it


---------104:56----------
it's all on me the past three years


---------104:58----------
i did that so much i paid every bill i


---------105:00----------
paid everything


---------105:01----------
that in her brain i starved her


---------105:05----------
from being her own woman when she left


---------105:08----------
me she was like i want to leave i want


---------105:10----------
my own place i want to pay my own bills


---------105:12----------
i want to be independent


---------105:14----------
i gave her so i didn't let her pay


---------105:15----------
anything that i stopped her from let's


---------105:18----------
say independency she could go out


---------105:19----------
she could go out i'm not keeping her


---------105:21----------
indoors she was allowed to go out she


---------105:23----------
could she was free as a bird


---------105:24----------
but because i paid all the bills her


---------105:26----------
brain taught is a negative because us


---------105:28----------
human beings will find a negative


---------105:30----------
look at millionaires look at


---------105:31----------
millionaires they they


---------105:33----------
still hate their lives some of them


---------105:35----------
because they just see negatives and


---------105:37----------
all their friends are afraid all their


---------105:38----------
friends are fake and


---------105:40----------
and they're you know and it's not enough


---------105:42----------
you know


---------105:43----------
so pretty much i made a mistake with my


---------105:45----------
ex-girlfriend i


---------105:47----------
i i pretty much started from


---------105:49----------
independence about paying all the bills


---------105:50----------
because i didn't want


---------105:51----------
her to live my ex i didn't want to feel


---------105:52----------
the same way i did when i was


---------105:55----------
um when i was a kid of the anxiety i'm


---------105:57----------
going to get thrown out get kicked out


---------105:58----------
oh my god it was the worst feeling in


---------106:00----------
the world worst feeling in the world and


---------106:02----------
that's that's so that's


---------106:03----------
one of the reasons why i want to buy a


---------106:05----------
house so it's like


---------106:07----------
yeah and i want to keep on going until i


---------106:08----------
feel really secure


---------106:10----------
it ain't gonna stop streaming all the


---------106:12----------
time every day


---------106:14----------
but yeah that's it so now you know a bit


---------106:16----------
more it's it


---------106:18----------
sheds a lot of light ally thank you so


---------106:20----------
much for sharing


---------106:21----------
right


---------106:25----------
is she insecure but my daughter


---------106:28----------
yeah we don't we not not at all she's


---------106:31----------
not scared of anyone


---------106:32----------
she doesn't play her by the children she


---------106:33----------
loves she prefers adults when she goes


---------106:36----------
to her school


---------106:37----------
does it she she i can have


---------106:40----------
10 strangers turn up women men she won't


---------106:43----------
care she'll walk in the room she doesn't


---------106:45----------
care she act like they're invisible


---------106:46----------
legit invisible where does that security


---------106:48----------
come from


---------106:50----------
what her security yeah i don't know


---------106:53----------
a lot of her kids her age are really shy


---------106:55----------
she hasn't she's the opposite yep she


---------106:57----------
just


---------106:58----------
yep ellie where does security come from


---------107:01----------
it's you're born that way right


---------107:05----------
no right or no no where does your


---------107:07----------
insecurity come from


---------107:10----------
which one the one with me want to buy


---------107:14----------
stuff or the one where i want the


---------107:15----------
attention like or the one where i'm


---------107:18----------
take your pick good good answer right


---------107:20----------
okay so your insecurities come from


---------107:22----------
experiences


---------107:24----------
your desire to have a house in security


---------107:26----------
comes from this


---------107:28----------
traumatic fear of being kicked out when


---------107:31----------
you were 16. that's where the


---------107:32----------
insecurities born


---------107:34----------
right the interesting thing is that


---------107:41----------
cookies i'm listening i'm listening i'm


---------107:42----------
listening right cookies is the full


---------107:44----------
cookie man


---------107:45----------
i'm gonna make a dinner shortly go on


---------107:46----------
carry on doc i'm listening yeah


---------107:49----------
no i'm just appreciating her


---------107:56----------
i'm always i'm all yeah so so my point


---------107:59----------
uh goren


---------108:00----------
and maybe we can


---------108:03----------
wrap up in a few minutes but just to


---------108:05----------
think about this is like so you're


---------108:07----------
trying to solve the insecurity of


---------108:09----------
yesterday by like buying a house today


---------108:11----------
i'm not saying you shouldn't get a house


---------108:12----------
absolutely you should provide


---------108:13----------
security but what i'm saying is that the


---------108:15----------
interesting thing is that


---------108:17----------
her security doesn't come from solving


---------108:19----------
an insecurity it comes from like


---------108:22----------
faith in herself and comfort because


---------108:24----------
like that's what you've given her


---------108:26----------
right like she knows her value as a


---------108:28----------
human being because you treat her with


---------108:30----------
value and what i'm saying is that the


---------108:33----------
solution to your


---------108:34----------
insecurity sure a house will help


---------108:37----------
but that emotional scar like has to be


---------108:40----------
dealt with directly


---------108:42----------
right so like it's about sitting with


---------108:44----------
some of the feelings that you have in


---------108:46----------
acknowledging


---------108:47----------
that you have this like traumatic event


---------108:50----------
about like being kicked out


---------108:52----------
but like appeasing the anxiety from the


---------108:55----------
outside doesn't actually do


---------108:57----------
anything to the insecurity like just


---------108:59----------
like when you get a nose job a little


---------109:00----------
while later you're going to be worried


---------109:01----------
about your teeth a little while later


---------109:03----------
you're going to be worried about your


---------109:04----------
hair


---------109:04----------
there's something with the insecurity


---------109:06----------
exists and fixing it from the outside


---------109:08----------
isn't going to do anything to the


---------109:10----------
insecurity on the inside


---------109:14----------
and so i know it's kind of a weird


---------109:15----------
question but you need to do for yourself


---------109:18----------
what you've done for your daughter and


---------109:21----------
then the insecurity will be gone


---------109:27----------
right right i've self-consciously done


---------109:30----------
that she's very


---------109:32----------
she's not insecure at all so tell me


---------109:34----------
exactly what i got to do


---------109:37----------
treat yourself the way that you treat


---------109:38----------
her pay attention the next time she


---------109:42----------
doesn't because she's gonna feel


---------109:43----------
insecure all the time


---------109:45----------
right so i know it's she's a secure kid


---------109:47----------
but they're gonna be little moments like


---------109:49----------
just now


---------109:50----------
right so that she has a need and like


---------109:53----------
how did you deal with her just like pay


---------109:56----------
attention to your interactions with her


---------109:58----------
because something about the way that you


---------110:00----------
interact with her has made her a secure


---------110:02----------
child


---------110:04----------
and i'm not sure exactly what that looks


---------110:06----------
like but i think you just got to look at


---------110:07----------
the way you treat her and look at the


---------110:08----------
way you treat yourself


---------110:10----------
look at the things within yourself that


---------110:12----------
prompt you to action


---------110:14----------
and look at the things within you that


---------110:16----------
prompt you to action for her


---------110:18----------
and they're very different


---------110:21----------
with her you have a fundamental idea


---------110:24----------
that she's okay


---------110:27----------
and so all of your interactions with her


---------110:29----------
are built on a foundation


---------110:31----------
of this kid is awesome when it comes to


---------110:34----------
yourself


---------110:35----------
the foundation is very different because


---------110:38----------
you weren't treated like you were okay


---------110:41----------
right growing up you had this stepdad


---------110:43----------
who you [ __ ] knew


---------110:45----------
he was looking for an excuse


---------110:50----------
he was just looking for an excuse


---------110:53----------
and your daughter


---------110:54----------
[Music]


---------110:56----------
has that's just alien to the way that


---------110:58----------
she's growing up


---------111:00----------
she has no idea what it was like


---------111:04----------
but that's where security comes from


---------111:08----------
fate or god or the universe


---------111:11----------
has given you a perfect example from how


---------111:14----------
to move forward to hear and she's in


---------111:16----------
your own home and she's three years old


---------111:20----------
do for yourself what you do for her


---------111:23----------
and whether you get a house or don't get


---------111:25----------
a house whether it's a big house or a


---------111:27----------
little house


---------111:29----------
whether you look beautiful or you look


---------111:32----------
ugly it won't matter


---------111:41----------
got it dog will do


---------111:45----------
how you feeling good good


---------111:48----------
just happy good


---------111:56----------
just good just um


---------111:59----------
yeah feeling good good good i'm happy to


---------112:02----------
hear it yeah


---------112:03----------
i'll leave you yeah yeah go on yeah i'll


---------112:06----------
leave you with one last thought ally and


---------112:08----------
then you can have the last word


---------112:10----------
so the only thing that i feel sad about


---------112:13----------
is that you chase something that you


---------112:16----------
don't need


---------112:18----------
right that you're fine the way you are


---------112:21----------
and all of your insecurities are


---------112:23----------
falsehoods


---------112:25----------
that were instilled in you by people who


---------112:28----------
didn't treat you the way that you should


---------112:29----------
have been treated


---------112:30----------
right yeah that makes sense it's their


---------112:33----------
estimation


---------112:35----------
in their eyes you're lacking and then


---------112:38----------
you learned how to look at yourself in


---------112:39----------
the mirror


---------112:40----------
and see what they saw but those [ __ ]


---------112:42----------
are wrong man


---------112:47----------
and so


---------112:51----------
look at yourself the way that you look


---------112:52----------
at your daughter


---------113:02----------
last word is yours my friend


---------113:06----------
the last word is mine yeah yeah if you


---------113:08----------
