so the first thing that's happened is
 

00:05:54.720 --> 00:05:56.390 align:start position:0%
so the first thing that's happened is
that<00:05:55.039><c> that</c><00:05:55.360><c> the</c><00:05:55.520><c> internet</c><00:05:55.919><c> has</c><00:05:56.080><c> sort</c><00:05:56.240><c> of</c>

00:05:56.390 --> 00:05:56.400 align:start position:0%
that that the internet has sort of

00:11:56.480 --> 00:11:58.069 align:start position:0%
and so as as blindfol as covet has taken
the<00:11:56.560><c> blindfold</c><00:11:57.120><c> off</c><00:11:57.360><c> a</c><00:11:57.440><c> lot</c><00:11:57.600><c> of</c><00:11:57.680><c> people</c><00:11:57.920><c> have</c>

00:11:58.069 --> 00:11:58.079 align:start position:0%
the blindfold off a lot of people have
 

00:11:58.079 --> 00:11:59.829 align:start position:0%
the blindfold off a lot of people have
started<00:11:58.320><c> to</c><00:11:58.480><c> re-question</c><00:11:59.040><c> their</c><00:11:59.279><c> priorities</c>

00:11:59.829 --> 00:11:59.839 align:start position:0%
started to re-question their priorities
 

00:11:59.839 --> 00:12:02.710 align:start position:0%
started to re-question their priorities
and<00:12:00.000><c> what</c><00:12:00.160><c> they're</c><00:12:00.320><c> willing</c><00:12:00.639><c> to</c><00:12:00.800><c> sacrifice</c>

00:12:02.710 --> 00:12:02.720 align:start position:0%
and what they're willing to sacrifice
 

00:12:02.720 --> 00:12:03.910 align:start position:0%
and what they're willing to sacrifice
so<00:12:02.959><c> just</c><00:12:03.120><c> kind</c><00:12:03.279><c> of</c><00:12:03.360><c> stepping</c><00:12:03.680><c> into</c>

00:12:03.910 --> 00:12:03.920 align:start position:0%
so just kind of stepping into
 

00:12:03.920 --> 00:12:05.990 align:start position:0%
so just kind of stepping into
evolutionary<00:12:04.560><c> theory</c><00:12:04.880><c> for</c><00:12:05.040><c> a</c><00:12:05.120><c> second</c>

00:12:05.990 --> 00:12:06.000 align:start position:0%
evolutionary theory for a second
 

00:12:06.000 --> 00:12:07.910 align:start position:0%
evolutionary theory for a second
so<00:12:06.160><c> i</c><00:12:06.240><c> think</c><00:12:06.399><c> that</c><00:12:06.639><c> basically</c><00:12:07.120><c> like</c><00:12:07.360><c> covet</c><00:12:07.760><c> has</c>

00:12:07.910 --> 00:12:07.920 align:start position:0%
so i think that basically like covet has
 

00:12:07.920 --> 00:12:10.710 align:start position:0%
so i think that basically like covet has
put<00:12:08.079><c> a</c><00:12:08.240><c> selection</c><00:12:08.880><c> pressure</c><00:12:09.360><c> on</c><00:12:09.680><c> jobs</c>

00:12:10.710 --> 00:12:10.720 align:start position:0%
put a selection pressure on jobs
 

00:12:10.720 --> 00:12:13.269 align:start position:0%
put a selection pressure on jobs
right<00:12:10.959><c> so</c><00:12:11.120><c> this</c><00:12:11.279><c> is</c><00:12:11.360><c> where</c><00:12:11.600><c> like</c><00:12:12.079><c> before</c>

00:12:13.269 --> 00:12:13.279 align:start position:0%
right so this is where like before
 

00:12:13.279 --> 00:12:15.670 align:start position:0%
right so this is where like before
these<00:12:13.920><c> behaviors</c><00:12:14.639><c> and</c><00:12:14.800><c> practices</c><00:12:15.440><c> by</c>

00:12:15.670 --> 00:12:15.680 align:start position:0%
these behaviors and practices by
 

00:12:15.680 --> 00:12:18.550 align:start position:0%
these behaviors and practices by
companies<00:12:16.480><c> went</c><00:12:16.800><c> on</c><00:12:17.200><c> unchecked</c><00:12:18.240><c> because</c>

00:12:18.550 --> 00:12:18.560 align:start position:0%
companies went on unchecked because
 

00:12:18.560 --> 00:12:20.389 align:start position:0%
companies went on unchecked because
there<00:12:18.720><c> was</c><00:12:18.959><c> no</c><00:12:19.279><c> consequence</c><00:12:20.079><c> in</c><00:12:20.240><c> the</c>

00:12:20.389 --> 00:12:20.399 align:start position:0%
there was no consequence in the
 

00:12:20.399 --> 00:12:21.509 align:start position:0%
there was no consequence in the
environment

00:12:21.509 --> 00:12:21.519 align:start position:0%
environment
 

00:12:21.519 --> 00:12:24.069 align:start position:0%
environment
so<00:12:22.000><c> you</c><00:12:22.079><c> know</c><00:12:22.720><c> the</c><00:12:22.880><c> theory</c><00:12:23.120><c> of</c><00:12:23.279><c> evolution</c><00:12:23.760><c> says</c>

00:12:24.069 --> 00:12:24.079 align:start position:0%
so you know the theory of evolution says
 

00:12:24.079 --> 00:12:26.470 align:start position:0%
so you know the theory of evolution says
survival<00:12:24.560><c> of</c><00:12:24.639><c> the</c><00:12:24.800><c> fittest</c><00:12:25.360><c> and</c><00:12:25.600><c> since</c>

00:12:26.470 --> 00:12:26.480 align:start position:0%
survival of the fittest and since
 

00:12:26.480 --> 00:12:27.990 align:start position:0%
survival of the fittest and since
companies<00:12:26.880><c> were</c><00:12:27.040><c> able</c><00:12:27.279><c> to</c><00:12:27.360><c> get</c><00:12:27.600><c> away</c><00:12:27.839><c> with</c>

00:12:27.990 --> 00:12:28.000 align:start position:0%
companies were able to get away with
 

00:12:28.000 --> 00:12:29.990 align:start position:0%
companies were able to get away with
that<00:12:28.240><c> sort</c><00:12:28.480><c> of</c><00:12:28.560><c> thing</c><00:12:29.040><c> they</c><00:12:29.360><c> did</c><00:12:29.600><c> get</c><00:12:29.760><c> away</c>

00:12:29.990 --> 00:12:30.000 align:start position:0%
that sort of thing they did get away
 

00:12:30.000 --> 00:12:31.670 align:start position:0%
that sort of thing they did get away
with<00:12:30.240><c> it</c><00:12:30.320><c> because</c><00:12:30.560><c> there</c><00:12:30.720><c> was</c><00:12:30.880><c> no</c><00:12:31.120><c> consequence</c>

00:12:31.670 --> 00:12:31.680 align:start position:0%
with it because there was no consequence
 

00:12:31.680 --> 00:12:33.269 align:start position:0%
with it because there was no consequence
for<00:12:31.839><c> them</c><00:12:32.480><c> and</c><00:12:32.639><c> now</c><00:12:32.880><c> what</c><00:12:33.040><c> i</c><00:12:33.120><c> think</c>

00:12:33.269 --> 00:12:33.279 align:start position:0%
for them and now what i think
 

00:12:33.279 --> 00:12:34.870 align:start position:0%
for them and now what i think
corporations<00:12:33.839><c> are</c><00:12:33.920><c> really</c><00:12:34.240><c> discovering</c><00:12:34.800><c> is</c>

00:12:34.870 --> 00:12:34.880 align:start position:0%
corporations are really discovering is
 

00:12:34.880 --> 00:12:36.389 align:start position:0%
corporations are really discovering is
that<00:12:35.040><c> there</c><00:12:35.200><c> is</c><00:12:35.440><c> actually</c><00:12:35.760><c> a</c><00:12:35.920><c> selection</c>

00:12:36.389 --> 00:12:36.399 align:start position:0%
that there is actually a selection
 

00:12:36.399 --> 00:12:38.230 align:start position:0%
that there is actually a selection

00:12:38.230 --> 00:12:38.240 align:start position:0%
pressure which is what's happening right
 

00:12:38.240 --> 00:12:40.550 align:start position:0%

so<00:12:38.480><c> workers</c><00:12:39.040><c> on</c><00:12:39.360><c> mass</c><00:12:39.760><c> are</c><00:12:39.839><c> deciding</c><00:12:40.320><c> to</c>

00:12:40.550 --> 00:12:40.560 align:start position:0%
so workers on mass are deciding to
 

00:12:40.560 --> 00:12:41.990 align:start position:0%
so workers on mass are deciding to
