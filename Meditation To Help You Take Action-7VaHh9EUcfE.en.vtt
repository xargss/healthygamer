for those of you guys who do get it the
 

00:10:02.520 --> 00:10:04.820 align:start position:0%
for those of you guys who do get it the

00:10:04.820 --> 00:10:04.830 align:start position:0%
listener would just do it but you don't
 

00:10:04.830 --> 00:10:07.430 align:start position:0%
listener would just do it but you don't
just<00:10:05.130><c> do</c><00:10:05.340><c> it</c><00:10:05.460><c> right</c><00:10:05.760><c> so</c><00:10:06.030><c> if</c><00:10:06.630><c> you</c><00:10:06.780><c> want</c><00:10:06.930><c> to</c><00:10:07.110><c> start</c>

00:10:07.430 --> 00:10:07.440 align:start position:0%
just do it right so if you want to start
 

00:10:07.440 --> 00:10:12.220 align:start position:0%
just do it right so if you want to start
doing<00:10:07.920><c> it</c><00:10:08.130><c> in</c><00:10:08.340><c> life</c><00:10:10.610><c> that's</c><00:10:11.610><c> what</c><00:10:11.760><c> she</c><00:10:11.880><c> said</c>

00:10:12.220 --> 00:10:12.230 align:start position:0%
doing it in life that's what she said
 

00:10:12.230 --> 00:10:16.100 align:start position:0%
doing it in life that's what she said
then<00:10:13.910><c> you</c><00:10:14.910><c> need</c><00:10:15.120><c> to</c><00:10:15.300><c> be</c><00:10:15.420><c> closer</c><00:10:15.690><c> to</c><00:10:16.020><c> the</c>

00:10:16.100 --> 00:10:16.110 align:start position:0%
then you need to be closer to the
 

00:10:16.110 --> 00:10:20.510 align:start position:0%
then you need to be closer to the
listener<00:10:18.290><c> because</c><00:10:19.290><c> if</c><00:10:19.620><c> you're</c><00:10:19.950><c> the</c><00:10:20.070><c> listener</c>

00:10:20.510 --> 00:10:20.520 align:start position:0%
listener because if you're the listener
 

00:10:20.520 --> 00:10:22.670 align:start position:0%
listener because if you're the listener
you<00:10:20.730><c> can</c><00:10:20.940><c> do</c><00:10:21.120><c> it</c><00:10:21.270><c> the</c><00:10:21.690><c> person</c><00:10:22.080><c> who</c><00:10:22.200><c> doesn't</c><00:10:22.410><c> do</c>

00:10:22.670 --> 00:10:22.680 align:start position:0%
you can do it the person who doesn't do
 

00:10:22.680 --> 00:10:23.900 align:start position:0%
you can do it the person who doesn't do
it<00:10:22.830><c> is</c><00:10:22.950><c> you</c><00:10:23.160><c> with</c><00:10:23.370><c> all</c><00:10:23.520><c> your</c><00:10:23.670><c> [ __ ]</c>
