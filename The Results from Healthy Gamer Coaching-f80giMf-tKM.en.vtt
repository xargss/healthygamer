society and
 

00:00:55.280 --> 00:00:58.709 align:start position:0%
society and

00:01:02.790 --> 00:01:02.800 align:start position:0%
now and what our society does to deal
 

00:01:02.800 --> 00:01:04.149 align:start position:0%
now and what our society does to deal

00:01:04.149 --> 00:01:04.159 align:start position:0%
with that is essentially like
 

00:01:04.159 --> 00:01:06.310 align:start position:0%
with that is essentially like
psychiatric<00:01:04.799><c> treatment</c><00:01:05.199><c> right</c>

00:01:06.310 --> 00:01:06.320 align:start position:0%

but<00:01:18.320><c> i</c><00:01:18.400><c> think</c><00:01:18.560><c> part</c><00:01:18.799><c> of</c><00:01:18.880><c> the</c><00:01:19.040><c> problem</c><00:01:19.439><c> is</c><00:01:19.520><c> that</c>

00:01:19.749 --> 00:01:19.759 align:start position:0%
but i think part of the problem is that
 

00:01:19.759 --> 00:01:22.070 align:start position:0%
but i think part of the problem is that
somewhere<00:01:20.159><c> along</c><00:01:20.479><c> the</c><00:01:20.560><c> way</c>

00:14:08.389 --> 00:14:08.399 align:start position:0%
so this is pretty interesting right so
 

00:14:08.399 --> 00:14:09.910 align:start position:0%
so this is pretty interesting right so
if<00:14:08.480><c> you</c><00:14:08.560><c> look</c><00:14:08.800><c> at</c><00:14:09.040><c> free</c><00:14:09.199><c> coaching</c><00:14:09.519><c> is</c><00:14:09.600><c> personal</c>

if you look at free coaching is personal
 

00:14:09.920 --> 00:14:11.110 align:start position:0%
if you look at free coaching is personal
by<00:14:10.079><c> the</c><00:14:10.160><c> way</c>

00:14:11.110 --> 00:14:11.120 align:start position:0%
by the way
 

00:14:11.120 --> 00:14:14.389 align:start position:0%
by the way
so<00:14:12.160><c> our</c><00:14:12.399><c> free</c><00:14:12.720><c> coaching</c><00:14:13.199><c> cohort</c><00:14:13.920><c> actually</c>

00:14:14.389 --> 00:14:14.399 align:start position:0%
so our free coaching cohort actually
 

00:14:14.399 --> 00:14:16.150 align:start position:0%
so our free coaching cohort actually
improves<00:14:14.959><c> more</c><00:14:15.199><c> than</c><00:14:15.440><c> our</c><00:14:15.519><c> paid</c><00:14:15.839><c> coaching</c>

00:14:16.150 --> 00:14:16.160 align:start position:0%

cohort
 

00:14:16.800 --> 00:14:18.629 align:start position:0%
cohort
so<00:14:16.959><c> like</c><00:14:17.120><c> the</c><00:14:17.279><c> question</c><00:14:17.600><c> that</c><00:14:17.760><c> we</c><00:14:17.920><c> wondered</c><00:14:18.480><c> is</c>

00:14:18.629 --> 00:14:18.639 align:start position:0%
so like the question that we wondered is
 

00:14:18.639 --> 00:14:21.030 align:start position:0%
so like the question that we wondered is
like<00:14:19.120><c> is</c><00:14:19.360><c> our</c><00:14:19.519><c> free</c><00:14:19.839><c> coaching</c>

00:14:21.030 --> 00:14:21.040 align:start position:0%
like is our free coaching
 

00:14:21.040 --> 00:14:23.750 align:start position:0%
like is our free coaching
lower<00:14:21.519><c> quality</c><00:14:22.000><c> than</c><00:14:22.160><c> our</c><00:14:22.320><c> personal</c><00:14:22.720><c> coaching</c>

00:14:23.750 --> 00:14:23.760 align:start position:0%
lower quality than our personal coaching
 

00:14:23.760 --> 00:14:25.509 align:start position:0%
lower quality than our personal coaching
and<00:14:23.920><c> it</c><00:14:24.000><c> turns</c><00:14:24.320><c> out</c><00:14:24.399><c> that</c><00:14:24.560><c> the</c><00:14:24.800><c> answer</c>

00:14:25.509 --> 00:14:25.519 align:start position:0%
and it turns out that the answer
 

00:14:25.519 --> 00:14:28.069 align:start position:0%
and it turns out that the answer
is<00:14:25.920><c> no</c><00:14:26.480><c> in</c><00:14:26.639><c> theory</c><00:14:26.959><c> it's</c><00:14:27.120><c> maybe</c><00:14:27.440><c> even</c><00:14:27.600><c> superior</c>

00:14:28.069 --> 00:14:28.079 align:start position:0%
is no in theory it's maybe even superior
 

00:14:28.079 --> 00:14:29.350 align:start position:0%
is no in theory it's maybe even superior
i<00:14:28.160><c> don't</c><00:14:28.399><c> i</c><00:14:28.480><c> think</c><00:14:28.639><c> there's</c><00:14:28.800><c> some</c><00:14:29.040><c> issues</c><00:14:29.279><c> with</c>

00:14:29.350 --> 00:14:29.360 align:start position:0%
i don't i think there's some issues with
 

00:14:29.360 --> 00:14:30.629 align:start position:0%
i don't i think there's some issues with
this<00:14:29.519><c> data</c><00:14:29.920><c> but</c>

00:14:30.629 --> 00:14:30.639 align:start position:0%
this data but
 

00:14:30.639 --> 00:14:31.910 align:start position:0%
this data but
generally<00:14:30.959><c> speaking</c><00:14:31.279><c> it</c><00:14:31.360><c> means</c><00:14:31.600><c> that</c><00:14:31.760><c> if</c>

00:14:31.910 --> 00:14:31.920 align:start position:0%
generally speaking it means that if
 

00:14:31.920 --> 00:14:33.350 align:start position:0%
generally speaking it means that if
you're<00:14:32.160><c> if</c><00:14:32.240><c> you're</c><00:14:32.399><c> a</c><00:14:32.480><c> free</c><00:14:32.720><c> coaching</c><00:14:33.040><c> client</c>

you're if you're a free coaching client
 

00:14:33.360 --> 00:14:34.949 align:start position:0%
you're if you're a free coaching client

00:14:34.949 --> 00:14:34.959 align:start position:0%
you're not getting the shaft
 

00:14:34.959 --> 00:14:37.350 align:start position:0%
you're not getting the shaft
okay<00:14:35.760><c> so</c><00:14:35.920><c> don't</c><00:14:36.079><c> worry</c><00:14:36.320><c> about</c><00:14:36.480><c> it</c><00:14:36.880><c> the</c><00:14:37.040><c> point</c>

00:14:37.350 --> 00:14:37.360 align:start position:0%
okay so don't worry about it the point
 

00:14:37.360 --> 00:14:38.710 align:start position:0%
okay so don't worry about it the point
here<00:14:37.600><c> though</c><00:14:37.760><c> is</c><00:14:37.920><c> that</c><00:14:38.000><c> if</c><00:14:38.160><c> you</c><00:14:38.240><c> look</c><00:14:38.399><c> at</c><00:14:38.480><c> these</c>

00:14:38.710 --> 00:14:38.720 align:start position:0%
here though is that if you look at these
 

00:14:38.720 --> 00:14:40.389 align:start position:0%
here though is that if you look at these
effect<00:14:39.040><c> sizes</c><00:14:39.360><c> like</c><00:14:39.600><c> i</c><00:14:39.680><c> mean</c><00:14:39.920><c> all</c><00:14:40.079><c> these</c><00:14:40.240><c> like</c>

00:14:40.389 --> 00:14:40.399 align:start position:0%
effect sizes like i mean all these like
