00:05:28.910 --> 00:05:31.330 align:start position:0%
actually just riding one page
and<00:05:29.290><c> like</c><00:05:30.290><c> riding</c><00:05:30.680><c> what's</c><00:05:30.890><c> wrong</c><00:05:31.070><c> with</c><00:05:31.190><c> the</c>

00:05:33.120 --> 00:05:33.130 align:start position:0%
world
 

00:05:33.130 --> 00:05:35.120 align:start position:0%
world
and<00:05:33.220><c> so</c><00:05:33.820><c> then</c><00:05:33.970><c> we</c><00:05:34.090><c> get</c><00:05:34.180><c> to</c><00:05:34.240><c> the</c><00:05:34.420><c> second</c><00:05:34.780><c> part</c>

00:05:35.120 --> 00:05:35.130 align:start position:0%
and so then we get to the second part
 

00:05:35.130 --> 00:05:37.740 align:start position:0%
and so then we get to the second part
which<00:05:36.130><c> is</c><00:05:36.160><c> like</c><00:05:36.610><c> after</c><00:05:37.000><c> you</c><00:05:37.120><c> write</c><00:05:37.330><c> one</c><00:05:37.570><c> page</c>

top 100 is sort of an achievement but if
 

00:13:25.519 --> 00:13:26.619 align:start position:0%
top 100 is sort of an achievement but if
we<00:13:25.639><c> really</c><00:13:25.909><c> think</c><00:13:26.089><c> about</c><00:13:26.179><c> it</c><00:13:26.389><c> like</c><00:13:26.479><c> that's</c>

00:13:26.619 --> 00:13:26.629 align:start position:0%
we really think about it like that's
 

00:13:26.629 --> 00:13:29.289 align:start position:0%
we really think about it like that's
just<00:13:26.959><c> not</c><00:13:27.049><c> I</c><00:13:27.469><c> was</c><00:13:27.739><c> like</c><00:13:27.889><c> numbered</c><00:13:28.339><c> like</c><00:13:28.579><c> 87</c><00:13:29.209><c> or</c>

00:13:29.289 --> 00:13:29.299 align:start position:0%
just not I was like numbered like 87 or
 

00:13:29.299 --> 00:13:32.769 align:start position:0%
just not I was like numbered like 87 or
something<00:13:29.659><c> on</c><00:13:29.779><c> the</c><00:13:30.559><c> NA</c><00:13:30.829><c> ladder</c><00:13:31.509><c> so</c><00:13:32.509><c> I</c><00:13:32.539><c> was</c><00:13:32.659><c> like</c>

00:13:32.769 --> 00:13:32.779 align:start position:0%
something on the NA ladder so I was like
 

00:13:32.779 --> 00:13:36.639 align:start position:0%
something on the NA ladder so I was like
good<00:13:33.049><c> at</c><00:13:33.199><c> war</c><00:13:33.349><c> 3</c><00:13:33.619><c> but</c><00:13:33.799><c> like</c><00:13:33.949><c> you</c><00:13:34.839><c> 87</c><00:13:35.839><c> is</c><00:13:36.469><c> it</c>

00:13:36.639 --> 00:13:36.649 align:start position:0%
good at war 3 but like you 87 is it
 

00:13:36.649 --> 00:13:38.289 align:start position:0%
good at war 3 but like you 87 is it
gonna<00:13:36.799><c> get</c><00:13:37.309><c> you</c><00:13:37.459><c> anywhere</c><00:13:37.669><c> in</c><00:13:37.939><c> the</c><00:13:37.999><c> eSports</c>

so

00:13:42.170 --> 00:13:42.180 align:start position:0%
so
 

00:13:42.180 --> 00:13:44.090 align:start position:0%
so
you<00:13:42.690><c> know</c><00:13:42.779><c> I</c><00:13:42.810><c> think</c><00:13:42.930><c> that's</c><00:13:43.230><c> fine</c><00:13:43.620><c> so</c><00:13:43.950><c> like</c>

00:13:44.090 --> 00:13:44.100 align:start position:0%
you know I think that's fine so like
 

00:13:44.100 --> 00:13:46.820 align:start position:0%
you know I think that's fine so like
that's<00:13:44.460><c> not</c><00:13:44.760><c> your</c><00:13:44.820><c> karma</c><00:13:45.510><c> in</c><00:13:45.570><c> this</c><00:13:45.810><c> life</c><00:13:46.080><c> right</c>

00:13:46.820 --> 00:13:46.830 align:start position:0%
that's not your karma in this life right
 

00:13:46.830 --> 00:13:48.560 align:start position:0%
that's not your karma in this life right
so<00:13:47.040><c> just</c><00:13:47.250><c> accept</c><00:13:47.730><c> that</c><00:13:47.850><c> for</c><00:13:48.089><c> a</c><00:13:48.150><c> moment</c><00:13:48.390><c> and</c><00:13:48.480><c> be</c>

00:13:48.560 --> 00:13:48.570 align:start position:0%
so just accept that for a moment and be
 

00:13:48.570 --> 00:13:50.300 align:start position:0%
so just accept that for a moment and be
like<00:13:48.720><c> okay</c><00:13:48.960><c> I</c><00:13:48.990><c> wanted</c><00:13:49.380><c> this</c><00:13:49.529><c> thing</c><00:13:49.589><c> and</c><00:13:49.950><c> now</c>

00:13:50.300 --> 00:13:50.310 align:start position:0%
like okay I wanted this thing and now
 

00:13:50.310 --> 00:13:51.950 align:start position:0%
like okay I wanted this thing and now
this<00:13:50.520><c> is</c><00:13:50.670><c> really</c><00:13:50.850><c> important</c><00:13:51.360><c> because</c><00:13:51.390><c> like</c><00:13:51.810><c> we</c>

00:13:51.950 --> 00:13:51.960 align:start position:0%
this is really important because like we
 

00:13:51.960 --> 00:13:54.380 align:start position:0%
this is really important because like we
learned<00:13:52.200><c> with</c><00:13:52.380><c> Helen</c><00:13:52.940><c> sometimes</c><00:13:53.940><c> we</c><00:13:54.180><c> don't</c>

00:13:54.380 --> 00:13:54.390 align:start position:0%
learned with Helen sometimes we don't
 

00:13:54.390 --> 00:13:59.310 align:start position:0%
learned with Helen sometimes we don't
let<00:13:54.630><c> ourselves</c><00:13:54.810><c> want</c><00:13:56.180><c> what</c><00:13:57.180><c> we</c><00:13:57.330><c> cannot</c><00:13:57.720><c> have</c>
