00:03:07.830 --> 00:03:07.840 align:start position:0%
going to do so this is kind of these are
 

00:03:07.840 --> 00:03:09.990 align:start position:0%
going to do so this is kind of these are
the<00:03:08.000><c> opinions</c><00:03:08.640><c> of</c><00:03:08.879><c> of</c><00:03:09.040><c> you</c><00:03:09.280><c> as</c><00:03:09.440><c> coaches</c><00:03:09.840><c> right</c>

setting<00:07:12.000><c> so</c><00:07:12.160><c> this</c><00:07:12.319><c> is</c><00:07:12.479><c> a</c><00:07:12.639><c> core</c><00:07:12.960><c> part</c><00:07:13.280><c> like</c><00:07:13.520><c> if</c>

00:07:13.589 --> 00:07:13.599 align:start position:0%
setting so this is a core part like if
 

00:07:13.599 --> 00:07:15.029 align:start position:0%
setting so this is a core part like if
we're<00:07:13.759><c> talking</c><00:07:14.000><c> about</c><00:07:14.240><c> you</c><00:07:14.319><c> know</c><00:07:14.400><c> the</c><00:07:14.560><c> 11</c>

00:07:19.270 --> 00:07:19.280 align:start position:0%
big part of it is understanding
 

00:07:19.280 --> 00:07:21.110 align:start position:0%
big part of it is understanding
designing<00:07:19.840><c> actions</c><00:07:20.319><c> planning</c><00:07:20.720><c> and</c><00:07:20.880><c> goal</c>

00:07:21.120 --> 00:07:22.469 align:start position:0%
designing actions planning and goal
setting

00:07:22.469 --> 00:07:22.479 align:start position:0%
setting
 

00:07:22.479 --> 00:07:23.589 align:start position:0%
setting
and<00:07:22.639><c> then</c>

00:07:23.589 --> 00:07:23.599 align:start position:0%
and then
 

00:07:23.599 --> 00:07:25.990 align:start position:0%
and then
managing<00:07:24.160><c> progress</c><00:07:24.639><c> and</c><00:07:24.720><c> accountability</c><00:07:25.840><c> so</c>

00:07:25.990 --> 00:07:26.000 align:start position:0%
managing progress and accountability so
 

00:07:26.000 --> 00:07:27.670 align:start position:0%
managing progress and accountability so
this<00:07:26.240><c> is</c><00:07:26.400><c> like</c><00:07:26.800><c> another</c><00:07:27.199><c> important</c><00:07:27.520><c> thing</c>

so those are the 11 things now let's
 

00:07:48.080 --> 00:07:50.469 align:start position:0%
so those are the 11 things now let's
take<00:07:48.240><c> a</c><00:07:48.319><c> look</c><00:07:48.720><c> at</c><00:07:49.360><c> um</c>

00:07:50.469 --> 00:07:50.479 align:start position:0%

okay<00:08:12.319><c> so</c>

00:08:13.749 --> 00:08:13.759 align:start position:0%
okay so
 

00:08:13.759 --> 00:08:15.670 align:start position:0%
okay so
they<00:08:13.919><c> have</c><00:08:14.080><c> these</c><00:08:14.240><c> different</c><00:08:14.560><c> standards</c>

they have these different standards
you<00:08:15.759><c> know</c><00:08:15.919><c> like</c>

00:08:16.710 --> 00:08:16.720 align:start position:0%
you know like
 

00:08:16.720 --> 00:08:17.990 align:start position:0%
you know like
but<00:08:17.120><c> that's</c><00:08:17.360><c> a</c><00:08:17.360><c> little</c><00:08:17.520><c> bit</c><00:08:17.680><c> different</c><00:08:17.919><c> it's</c>

00:08:17.990 --> 00:08:18.000 align:start position:0%
but that's a little bit different it's
 

00:08:18.000 --> 00:08:19.990 align:start position:0%
but that's a little bit different it's
not<00:08:18.160><c> really</c><00:08:18.319><c> what</c><00:08:18.479><c> their</c><00:08:18.800><c> practices</c>

00:08:19.990 --> 00:08:20.000 align:start position:0%

okay um
 

00:10:35.920 --> 00:10:38.230 align:start position:0%
okay um
yeah<00:10:36.240><c> so</c><00:10:36.560><c> i</c><00:10:36.800><c> i</c><00:10:36.959><c> would</c><00:10:37.279><c> say</c><00:10:37.440><c> that</c><00:10:37.600><c> that's</c><00:10:38.000><c> maybe</c>

00:10:38.230 --> 00:10:38.240 align:start position:0%
yeah so i i would say that that's maybe
 

00:10:38.240 --> 00:10:40.230 align:start position:0%
yeah so i i would say that that's maybe
that's<00:10:38.480><c> just</c><00:10:38.720><c> an</c><00:10:38.880><c> unfair</c><00:10:39.360><c> representation</c>

00:10:40.230 --> 00:10:40.240 align:start position:0%
that's just an unfair representation
 

00:10:40.240 --> 00:10:41.910 align:start position:0%
that's just an unfair representation
because<00:10:40.560><c> we're</c><00:10:40.800><c> kind</c><00:10:40.959><c> of</c><00:10:41.040><c> comparing</c><00:10:41.519><c> apples</c>

00:10:41.910 --> 00:10:41.920 align:start position:0%

00:10:43.509 --> 00:10:43.519 align:start position:0%

00:10:44.790 --> 00:10:44.800 align:start position:0%
in the sense that like this is just the

00:10:48.470 --> 00:10:48.480 align:start position:0%

00:10:48.480 --> 00:10:50.150 align:start position:0%

emerge<00:10:49.040><c> we'll</c><00:10:49.279><c> actually</c><00:10:49.519><c> look</c><00:10:49.760><c> at</c><00:10:49.839><c> like</c><00:10:50.079><c> a</c>

00:10:50.150 --> 00:10:50.160 align:start position:0%
emerge we'll actually look at like a
 

00:10:50.160 --> 00:10:52.630 align:start position:0%
emerge we'll actually look at like a

that<00:10:52.880><c> out</c>

00:10:53.750 --> 00:10:53.760 align:start position:0%
that out
 

00:10:53.760 --> 00:10:57.509 align:start position:0%
that out

00:10:57.509 --> 00:10:57.519 align:start position:0%
 
 

00:10:57.519 --> 00:10:58.550 align:start position:0%
 
okay

00:10:58.550 --> 00:10:58.560 align:start position:0%
okay
 

00:10:58.560 --> 00:11:00.069 align:start position:0%
okay
so<00:10:58.959><c> um</c><00:10:59.279><c> next</c><00:10:59.519><c> thing</c><00:10:59.680><c> that</c><00:10:59.760><c> we're</c><00:10:59.920><c> going</c><00:11:00.000><c> to</c>

00:11:00.069 --> 00:11:00.079 align:start position:0%

00:11:00.079 --> 00:11:01.670 align:start position:0%
so um next thing that we're going to
kind<00:11:00.240><c> of</c><00:11:00.320><c> look</c><00:11:00.480><c> at</c><00:11:00.720><c> is</c><00:11:00.800><c> like</c><00:11:01.040><c> you</c><00:11:01.120><c> know</c><00:11:01.440><c> if</c><00:11:01.519><c> we</c>

so<00:11:22.480><c> i</c><00:11:22.560><c> think</c><00:11:22.720><c> what</c><00:11:22.880><c> we</c><00:11:22.959><c> see</c><00:11:23.120><c> is</c><00:11:23.279><c> there's</c><00:11:23.440><c> a</c>

00:11:23.509 --> 00:11:23.519 align:start position:0%
so i think what we see is there's a
 

00:11:23.519 --> 00:11:25.430 align:start position:0%
so i think what we see is there's a
minimum<00:11:23.920><c> of</c><00:11:24.079><c> two</c><00:11:24.240><c> years</c><00:11:24.560><c> or</c><00:11:24.720><c> three</c><00:11:24.959><c> thousand</c>

00:11:25.430 --> 00:11:25.440 align:start position:0%
minimum of two years or three thousand
 

00:11:25.440 --> 00:11:27.829 align:start position:0%

00:11:27.839 --> 00:11:29.509 align:start position:0%
hours in a supervised clinical setting
so<00:11:28.000><c> i</c><00:11:28.079><c> think</c><00:11:28.240><c> like</c><00:11:28.399><c> the</c><00:11:28.640><c> key</c><00:11:28.880><c> thing</c><00:11:29.120><c> that</c><00:11:29.279><c> i</c>

00:11:29.509 --> 00:11:29.519 align:start position:0%
so i think like the key thing that i
 

00:11:29.519 --> 00:11:32.470 align:start position:0%
so i think like the key thing that i
sort<00:11:29.680><c> of</c><00:11:29.839><c> notice</c><00:11:30.240><c> here</c><00:11:30.720><c> is</c><00:11:30.880><c> that</c><00:11:31.279><c> um</c>

00:11:32.470 --> 00:11:32.480 align:start position:0%
sort of notice here is that um
