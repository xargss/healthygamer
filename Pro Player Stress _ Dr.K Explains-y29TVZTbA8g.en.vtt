that I've been thinking about the most
recently<00:00:19.980><c> is</c><00:00:20.750><c> actually</c><00:00:22.880><c> so</c><00:00:23.880><c> I</c><00:00:23.910><c> think</c><00:00:24.029><c> a</c><00:00:24.240><c> lot</c><00:00:24.449><c> of</c>

00:00:24.939 --> 00:00:24.949 align:start position:0%
recently is actually so I think a lot of
 

00:00:24.949 --> 00:00:29.000 align:start position:0%
recently is actually so I think a lot of
so<00:00:25.949><c> one</c><00:00:26.189><c> huge</c><00:00:26.519><c> problem</c><00:00:26.730><c> is</c><00:00:27.240><c> that</c><00:00:28.010><c> eSports</c>

00:00:29.000 --> 00:00:29.010 align:start position:0%
so one huge problem is that eSports
 

00:00:29.010 --> 00:00:32.420 align:start position:0%
so one huge problem is that eSports
doesn't<00:00:29.849><c> have</c><00:00:30.090><c> a</c><00:00:30.119><c> physical</c><00:00:30.539><c> limitation</c><00:00:31.470><c> so</c>

00:00:32.420 --> 00:00:32.430 align:start position:0%
doesn't have a physical limitation so
 

00:00:32.430 --> 00:00:33.979 align:start position:0%
doesn't have a physical limitation so
what<00:00:32.610><c> happens</c><00:00:33.000><c> is</c><00:00:33.180><c> like</c><00:00:33.329><c> if</c><00:00:33.480><c> you</c><00:00:33.570><c> look</c><00:00:33.719><c> at</c><00:00:33.870><c> like</c>

00:01:00.740 --> 00:01:00.750 align:start position:0%
limitation so another thing is I think
 

00:01:00.750 --> 00:01:02.150 align:start position:0%
limitation so another thing is I think
that<00:01:00.870><c> eighteen</c><00:01:01.379><c> year</c><00:01:01.530><c> olds</c><00:01:01.739><c> are</c><00:01:01.829><c> just</c><00:01:02.010><c> not</c>

00:01:04.729 --> 00:01:04.739 align:start position:0%
like cognitively prepared for this
 

00:01:04.739 --> 00:01:07.940 align:start position:0%
like cognitively prepared for this
degree<00:01:05.460><c> of</c><00:01:05.640><c> stress</c><00:01:05.970><c> so</c><00:01:06.960><c> a</c><00:01:06.990><c> lot</c><00:01:07.170><c> of</c><00:01:07.290><c> times</c><00:01:07.530><c> so</c>

00:01:07.940 --> 00:01:07.950 align:start position:0%
degree of stress so a lot of times so
 

00:01:07.950 --> 00:01:09.530 align:start position:0%
