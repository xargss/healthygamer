like<00:02:46.640><c> what</c><00:02:46.800><c> are</c><00:02:46.879><c> the</c><00:02:47.040><c> steps</c><00:02:47.440><c> involved</c><00:02:47.840><c> and</c>

00:02:47.990 --> 00:02:48.000 align:start position:0%
like what are the steps involved and
 

00:02:48.000 --> 00:02:49.670 align:start position:0%
like what are the steps involved and
execute<00:02:48.480><c> on</c><00:02:48.560><c> those</c><00:02:48.879><c> tasks</c>

00:02:49.670 --> 00:02:49.680 align:start position:0%
execute on those tasks
 

00:02:49.680 --> 00:02:51.190 align:start position:0%
execute on those tasks
so<00:02:49.840><c> the</c><00:02:49.920><c> first</c><00:02:50.160><c> thing</c><00:02:50.319><c> to</c><00:02:50.560><c> understand</c><00:02:50.959><c> about</c>

00:02:51.190 --> 00:02:51.200 align:start position:0%
so the first thing to understand about
 

00:02:51.200 --> 00:02:53.589 align:start position:0%
so the first thing to understand about
executive<00:02:51.680><c> function</c><00:02:52.400><c> is</c><00:02:52.560><c> that</c>

00:02:53.589 --> 00:02:53.599 align:start position:0%
executive function is that
 

00:02:53.599 --> 00:02:56.550 align:start position:0%
executive function is that
it<00:02:53.840><c> improves</c><00:02:54.239><c> with</c><00:02:54.400><c> age</c><00:02:55.120><c> and</c><00:02:55.200><c> your</c><00:02:55.680><c> executive</c>

00:02:56.550 --> 00:02:56.560 align:start position:0%
it improves with age and your executive
 

00:02:56.560 --> 00:02:58.550 align:start position:0%
it improves with age and your executive
function<00:02:57.040><c> kind</c><00:02:57.200><c> of</c>

00:02:58.550 --> 00:02:58.560 align:start position:0%
function kind of
 

00:02:58.560 --> 00:03:00.710 align:start position:0%
function kind of
uh<00:02:58.879><c> you</c><00:02:59.040><c> know</c><00:02:59.200><c> reaches</c><00:02:59.519><c> its</c><00:02:59.760><c> full</c><00:02:59.920><c> potential</c>

00:03:00.710 --> 00:03:00.720 align:start position:0%
uh you know reaches its full potential
 

00:03:00.720 --> 00:03:01.910 align:start position:0%
uh you know reaches its full potential
it's<00:03:00.879><c> somewhere</c><00:03:01.280><c> between</c>

00:03:01.910 --> 00:03:01.920 align:start position:0%
it's somewhere between
 

00:03:01.920 --> 00:03:04.550 align:start position:0%
it's somewhere between
the<00:03:02.239><c> age</c><00:03:02.800><c> ages</c><00:03:03.120><c> of</c><00:03:03.280><c> 30</c><00:03:03.599><c> and</c><00:03:03.680><c> 32</c><00:03:04.159><c> and</c><00:03:04.239><c> this</c><00:03:04.400><c> has</c>

00:03:04.550 --> 00:03:04.560 align:start position:0%
the age ages of 30 and 32 and this has
 

00:03:04.560 --> 00:03:06.949 align:start position:0%
the age ages of 30 and 32 and this has
to<00:03:04.640><c> do</c><00:03:04.720><c> with</c><00:03:04.879><c> frontal</c><00:03:05.200><c> lobe</c><00:03:05.519><c> development</c>

00:03:06.949 --> 00:03:06.959 align:start position:0%
to do with frontal lobe development
 

00:03:06.959 --> 00:03:09.110 align:start position:0%
to do with frontal lobe development
so<00:03:07.360><c> the</c><00:03:07.519><c> first</c><00:03:08.080><c> issue</c><00:03:08.319><c> for</c><00:03:08.480><c> this</c><00:03:08.640><c> person</c><00:03:08.959><c> is</c>

00:03:09.110 --> 00:03:09.120 align:start position:0%
so the first issue for this person is

and<00:06:45.680><c> it</c><00:06:45.759><c> feels</c><00:06:46.080><c> incredibly</c><00:06:46.560><c> paralyzing</c>

00:06:47.510 --> 00:06:47.520 align:start position:0%
and it feels incredibly paralyzing
 

00:06:47.520 --> 00:06:48.629 align:start position:0%
and it feels incredibly paralyzing
because<00:06:47.840><c> our</c><00:06:48.000><c> brain</c><00:06:48.400><c> is</c>

00:06:48.629 --> 00:06:48.639 align:start position:0%
because our brain is
 

00:06:48.639 --> 00:06:50.950 align:start position:0%
because our brain is
literally<00:06:49.120><c> not</c><00:06:49.440><c> able</c><00:06:49.680><c> to</c><00:06:49.759><c> do</c><00:06:49.919><c> this</c><00:06:50.560><c> so</c><00:06:50.720><c> if</c><00:06:50.880><c> we</c>

00:06:50.950 --> 00:06:50.960 align:start position:0%
literally not able to do this so if we
 

00:06:50.960 --> 00:06:52.710 align:start position:0%
literally not able to do this so if we
think<00:06:51.199><c> about</c><00:06:51.599><c> how</c><00:06:51.840><c> you</c><00:06:51.919><c> know</c><00:06:52.160><c> how</c><00:06:52.319><c> do</c><00:06:52.479><c> you</c>

00:06:52.710 --> 00:06:52.720 align:start position:0%
think about how you know how do you
 

00:06:52.720 --> 00:06:54.710 align:start position:0%
think about how you know how do you
start<00:06:53.039><c> on</c><00:06:53.199><c> a</c><00:06:53.360><c> task</c><00:06:53.759><c> that's</c><00:06:54.000><c> too</c><00:06:54.240><c> big</c>

00:06:54.710 --> 00:06:54.720 align:start position:0%
start on a task that's too big
 

00:06:54.720 --> 00:06:57.029 align:start position:0%
start on a task that's too big
you<00:06:54.880><c> can't</c><00:06:55.599><c> so</c><00:06:55.759><c> this</c><00:06:55.919><c> is</c><00:06:56.000><c> why</c><00:06:56.160><c> people</c><00:06:56.800><c> feel</c>

00:06:57.029 --> 00:06:57.039 align:start position:0%
you can't so this is why people feel
 

00:06:57.039 --> 00:06:58.790 align:start position:0%
you can't so this is why people feel
paralyzed<00:06:57.520><c> because</c><00:06:57.759><c> if</c><00:06:57.840><c> the</c><00:06:58.000><c> task</c><00:06:58.319><c> is</c><00:06:58.479><c> too</c><00:06:58.639><c> big</c>

00:06:58.790 --> 00:06:58.800 align:start position:0%
paralyzed because if the task is too big
 

00:06:58.800 --> 00:07:00.550 align:start position:0%
paralyzed because if the task is too big
you<00:06:59.039><c> literally</c><00:06:59.440><c> cannot</c><00:06:59.840><c> do</c><00:07:00.080><c> it</c>

00:07:00.550 --> 00:07:00.560 align:start position:0%
you literally cannot do it
 

00:07:00.560 --> 00:07:03.350 align:start position:0%
you literally cannot do it
like<00:07:00.800><c> i</c><00:07:01.039><c> can't</c><00:07:01.280><c> like</c><00:07:01.440><c> if</c><00:07:01.599><c> i</c><00:07:01.680><c> were</c><00:07:01.840><c> to</c><00:07:02.000><c> tell</c><00:07:02.240><c> you</c>

00:07:03.350 --> 00:07:03.360 align:start position:0%
like i can't like if i were to tell you
 

00:07:03.360 --> 00:07:03.830 align:start position:0%
like i can't like if i were to tell you
you<00:07:03.520><c> know</c>

00:07:03.830 --> 00:07:03.840 align:start position:0%
you know
 

00:07:03.840 --> 00:07:07.029 align:start position:0%
you know
win<00:07:04.080><c> a</c><00:07:04.160><c> nobel</c><00:07:04.560><c> prize</c><00:07:06.720><c> like</c>

00:07:07.029 --> 00:07:07.039 align:start position:0%
win a nobel prize like
 

00:07:07.039 --> 00:07:08.710 align:start position:0%
win a nobel prize like
how<00:07:07.199><c> do</c><00:07:07.280><c> you</c><00:07:07.440><c> even</c><00:07:07.759><c> start</c><00:07:08.080><c> with</c><00:07:08.240><c> that</c><00:07:08.560><c> like</c>

00:07:08.710 --> 00:07:08.720 align:start position:0%
how do you even start with that like
 

00:07:08.720 --> 00:07:11.510 align:start position:0%
how do you even start with that like
that's<00:07:09.039><c> crazy</c><00:07:09.360><c> like</c><00:07:09.599><c> you</c><00:07:09.680><c> may</c><00:07:09.840><c> be</c><00:07:10.080><c> able</c><00:07:10.319><c> to</c>

00:07:11.510 --> 00:07:11.520 align:start position:0%
that's crazy like you may be able to
 

00:07:11.520 --> 00:07:13.589 align:start position:0%
that's crazy like you may be able to
theoretically<00:07:12.319><c> map</c><00:07:12.639><c> out</c><00:07:12.880><c> what</c><00:07:13.039><c> needs</c><00:07:13.360><c> to</c><00:07:13.440><c> be</c>

00:07:13.589 --> 00:07:13.599 align:start position:0%
theoretically map out what needs to be
 

00:07:13.599 --> 00:07:15.510 align:start position:0%
theoretically map out what needs to be
done<00:07:13.840><c> but</c><00:07:14.080><c> you</c><00:07:14.240><c> can't</c><00:07:14.560><c> actually</c><00:07:15.039><c> break</c><00:07:15.360><c> it</c>

00:07:15.510 --> 00:07:15.520 align:start position:0%
done but you can't actually break it
 

00:07:15.520 --> 00:07:15.990 align:start position:0%
done but you can't actually break it
apart

00:07:15.990 --> 00:07:16.000 align:start position:0%
apart
 

00:07:16.000 --> 00:07:19.029 align:start position:0%
apart
into<00:07:16.240><c> like</c><00:07:16.560><c> it's</c><00:07:16.880><c> subsequent</c><00:07:17.440><c> pieces</c><00:07:18.880><c> and</c>

00:07:19.029 --> 00:07:19.039 align:start position:0%
into like it's subsequent pieces and
 

00:07:19.039 --> 00:07:20.390 align:start position:0%
into like it's subsequent pieces and
actually<00:07:19.440><c> execute</c><00:07:19.919><c> on</c><00:07:20.080><c> it</c>

00:07:20.390 --> 00:07:20.400 align:start position:0%
actually execute on it
 

00:07:20.400 --> 00:07:21.909 align:start position:0%
actually execute on it
so<00:07:20.560><c> then</c><00:07:20.720><c> the</c><00:07:20.880><c> question</c><00:07:21.199><c> is</c><00:07:21.280><c> what</c><00:07:21.520><c> to</c><00:07:21.599><c> do</c><00:07:21.759><c> about</c>

00:07:21.909 --> 00:07:21.919 align:start position:0%
so then the question is what to do about
 

00:07:21.919 --> 00:07:23.510 align:start position:0%
so then the question is what to do about
executive<00:07:22.400><c> function</c>

00:07:23.510 --> 00:07:23.520 align:start position:0%
executive function
 

00:07:23.520 --> 00:07:25.430 align:start position:0%
executive function
about<00:07:23.840><c> executive</c><00:07:24.240><c> dysfunction</c><00:07:24.720><c> actually</c><00:07:25.280><c> and</c>

00:07:25.430 --> 00:07:25.440 align:start position:0%
about executive dysfunction actually and
 

00:07:25.440 --> 00:07:26.469 align:start position:0%
about executive dysfunction actually and
this<00:07:25.599><c> is</c><00:07:25.680><c> where</c><00:07:25.840><c> there</c><00:07:26.000><c> are</c><00:07:26.000><c> a</c><00:07:26.080><c> couple</c><00:07:26.319><c> of</c>

00:07:26.469 --> 00:07:26.479 align:start position:0%
this is where there are a couple of
 

00:07:26.479 --> 00:07:28.309 align:start position:0%
this is where there are a couple of
things<00:07:26.720><c> to</c><00:07:26.800><c> recognize</c>

00:07:28.309 --> 00:07:28.319 align:start position:0%
things to recognize
 

00:07:28.319 --> 00:07:31.749 align:start position:0%
things to recognize
so<00:07:28.639><c> when</c><00:07:28.880><c> people</c><00:07:29.680><c> um</c>

00:07:31.749 --> 00:07:31.759 align:start position:0%
so when people um
 

00:07:31.759 --> 00:07:34.070 align:start position:0%
so when people um
have<00:07:32.080><c> paralysis</c><00:07:32.960><c> and</c><00:07:33.120><c> executive</c><00:07:33.520><c> dysfunction</c>

00:07:34.070 --> 00:07:34.080 align:start position:0%
have paralysis and executive dysfunction
 

00:07:34.080 --> 00:07:35.430 align:start position:0%
have paralysis and executive dysfunction
there<00:07:34.240><c> are</c><00:07:34.319><c> a</c><00:07:34.400><c> couple</c><00:07:34.800><c> of</c><00:07:35.039><c> different</c>

00:07:35.430 --> 00:07:35.440 align:start position:0%
there are a couple of different
 

00:07:35.440 --> 00:07:36.309 align:start position:0%
there are a couple of different
components

00:07:36.309 --> 00:07:36.319 align:start position:0%
components
 

00:07:36.319 --> 00:07:37.990 align:start position:0%
components
so<00:07:36.479><c> when</c><00:07:36.639><c> you're</c><00:07:36.960><c> paralyzed</c><00:07:37.599><c> towards</c><00:07:37.840><c> a</c>

00:07:37.990 --> 00:07:38.000 align:start position:0%
so when you're paralyzed towards a
 

00:07:38.000 --> 00:07:39.670 align:start position:0%
so when you're paralyzed towards a
behavior<00:07:39.039><c> there</c><00:07:39.360><c> are</c>

00:07:39.670 --> 00:07:39.680 align:start position:0%
behavior there are
 

00:07:39.680 --> 00:07:41.990 align:start position:0%
behavior there are
three<00:07:40.000><c> things</c><00:07:40.319><c> that</c><00:07:40.479><c> i'd</c><00:07:40.639><c> like</c><00:07:40.800><c> to</c><00:07:40.960><c> talk</c><00:07:41.199><c> about</c>

00:07:41.990 --> 00:07:42.000 align:start position:0%
three things that i'd like to talk about
 

00:07:42.000 --> 00:07:44.070 align:start position:0%
three things that i'd like to talk about
the<00:07:42.240><c> first</c><00:07:42.560><c> is</c><00:07:42.840><c> operationalize</c>

00:07:44.070 --> 00:07:44.080 align:start position:0%
the first is operationalize
 

00:07:44.080 --> 00:07:45.589 align:start position:0%
the first is operationalize
so<00:07:44.240><c> what</c><00:07:44.400><c> this</c><00:07:44.639><c> means</c><00:07:44.960><c> is</c><00:07:45.120><c> like</c><00:07:45.280><c> there's</c>

00:07:45.589 --> 00:07:45.599 align:start position:0%
so what this means is like there's
 

00:07:45.599 --> 00:07:47.589 align:start position:0%
so what this means is like there's
actually<00:07:45.919><c> a</c><00:07:46.080><c> formal</c><00:07:46.560><c> process</c><00:07:47.120><c> that</c><00:07:47.280><c> you</c><00:07:47.440><c> can</c>

00:07:47.589 --> 00:07:47.599 align:start position:0%
actually a formal process that you can
 

00:07:47.599 --> 00:07:47.909 align:start position:0%
actually a formal process that you can
get

00:07:47.909 --> 00:07:47.919 align:start position:0%
get
 

00:07:47.919 --> 00:07:51.029 align:start position:0%
get
trained<00:07:48.560><c> in</c><00:07:49.520><c> to</c><00:07:49.840><c> do</c><00:07:50.160><c> this</c>

00:07:51.029 --> 00:07:51.039 align:start position:0%
trained in to do this
 

00:07:51.039 --> 00:07:53.110 align:start position:0%
trained in to do this
so<00:07:51.199><c> this</c><00:07:51.440><c> is</c><00:07:51.520><c> what</c><00:07:51.680><c> we</c><00:07:51.759><c> call</c><00:07:52.160><c> operationalizing</c>

00:07:53.110 --> 00:07:53.120 align:start position:0%
so this is what we call operationalizing
 

00:07:53.120 --> 00:07:54.309 align:start position:0%
so this is what we call operationalizing
problems

00:07:54.309 --> 00:07:54.319 align:start position:0%
problems
 

00:07:54.319 --> 00:07:57.189 align:start position:0%

00:12:39.839 --> 00:12:41.269 align:start position:0%
emotions and frustration i think
generally<00:12:40.240><c> speaking</c><00:12:40.480><c> i</c><00:12:40.560><c> just</c><00:12:40.720><c> do</c><00:12:40.880><c> two</c><00:12:41.040><c> things</c>

00:12:41.269 --> 00:12:41.279 align:start position:0%
generally speaking i just do two things

generally speaking i just do two things
with<00:12:41.360><c> them</c><00:12:41.519><c> so</c><00:12:41.760><c> we</c><00:12:41.839><c> tend</c><00:12:42.079><c> to</c><00:12:42.160><c> get</c><00:12:42.399><c> to</c>

00:12:43.110 --> 00:12:43.120 align:start position:0%
with them so we tend to get to
 

00:12:43.120 --> 00:12:44.949 align:start position:0%
with them so we tend to get to
processing<00:12:43.680><c> their</c><00:12:43.839><c> negative</c><00:12:44.240><c> emotions</c><00:12:44.800><c> and</c>

00:12:44.949 --> 00:12:44.959 align:start position:0%
processing their negative emotions and
 

00:12:44.959 --> 00:12:47.670 align:start position:0%
processing their negative emotions and
then<00:12:45.040><c> we</c><00:12:45.279><c> operationalize</c><00:12:46.240><c> problems</c>

00:12:47.670 --> 00:12:47.680 align:start position:0%
then we operationalize problems
 

00:12:47.680 --> 00:12:49.509 align:start position:0%
then we operationalize problems
and<00:12:47.760><c> we</c><00:12:47.920><c> use</c><00:12:48.079><c> that</c><00:12:48.320><c> exercise</c><00:12:48.880><c> and</c><00:12:48.959><c> that</c><00:12:49.200><c> tends</c>

00:12:49.509 --> 00:12:49.519 align:start position:0%
and we use that exercise and that tends
 

00:12:49.519 --> 00:12:51.269 align:start position:0%
and we use that exercise and that tends
to<00:12:49.680><c> be</c><00:12:50.160><c> actually</c><00:12:50.560><c> like</c><00:12:50.720><c> the</c><00:12:50.880><c> way</c><00:12:51.040><c> that</c><00:12:51.200><c> you</c>
