00:01:02.069 --> 00:01:02.079 align:start position:0%
through how this works okay so
 

00:01:02.079 --> 00:01:03.349 align:start position:0%
through how this works okay so
this<00:01:02.320><c> is</c><00:01:02.399><c> like</c><00:01:02.640><c> the</c><00:01:02.800><c> problem</c><00:01:03.120><c> with</c><00:01:03.280><c> the</c>

00:01:03.349 --> 00:01:03.359 align:start position:0%
this is like the problem with the
 

00:01:03.359 --> 00:01:05.750 align:start position:0%
this is like the problem with the
chicken<00:01:03.760><c> and</c><00:01:03.840><c> the</c><00:01:03.920><c> egg</c><00:01:04.239><c> because</c>

00:01:05.750 --> 00:01:05.760 align:start position:0%
chicken and the egg because
 

00:01:05.760 --> 00:01:07.750 align:start position:0%
chicken and the egg because
when<00:01:06.000><c> you</c><00:01:06.240><c> don't</c><00:01:06.560><c> so</c><00:01:06.720><c> let's</c><00:01:06.960><c> say</c><00:01:07.119><c> like</c><00:01:07.439><c> on</c><00:01:07.600><c> the</c>

00:01:07.750 --> 00:01:07.760 align:start position:0%
when you don't so let's say like on the
 

00:01:07.760 --> 00:01:10.310 align:start position:0%
when you don't so let's say like on the
inside<00:01:08.400><c> i'm</c><00:01:08.560><c> not</c><00:01:08.799><c> confident</c><00:01:09.360><c> in</c><00:01:09.520><c> myself</c>

inside i'm not confident in myself
 

00:01:10.320 --> 00:01:12.789 align:start position:0%
inside i'm not confident in myself
so<00:01:10.479><c> what</c><00:01:10.720><c> happens</c><00:01:11.119><c> is</c><00:01:11.280><c> i</c><00:01:11.360><c> put</c><00:01:11.600><c> a</c><00:01:11.680><c> mask</c><00:01:12.080><c> on</c><00:01:12.640><c> and</c>

00:01:12.789 --> 00:01:12.799 align:start position:0%
so what happens is i put a mask on and
 

00:01:12.799 --> 00:01:13.750 align:start position:0%
so what happens is i put a mask on and
then<00:01:13.040><c> i</c><00:01:13.200><c> go</c>

00:01:13.750 --> 00:01:13.760 align:start position:0%
then i go
 

00:01:13.760 --> 00:01:15.429 align:start position:0%
then i go

in the people's reaction to the mask so
 

00:01:33.360 --> 00:01:34.230 align:start position:0%
in the people's reaction to the mask so
as<00:01:33.520><c> a</c><00:01:33.680><c> person</c>

00:01:34.230 --> 00:01:34.240 align:start position:0%
as a person
 

00:01:34.240 --> 00:01:36.230 align:start position:0%
as a person
what<00:01:34.479><c> i</c><00:01:34.560><c> think</c><00:01:34.799><c> so</c><00:01:34.960><c> for</c><00:01:35.119><c> example</c><00:01:35.520><c> i'm</c><00:01:35.759><c> all</c><00:01:36.000><c> oak</c>

00:01:36.230 --> 00:01:36.240 align:start position:0%
what i think so for example i'm all oak
 

00:01:36.240 --> 00:01:37.590 align:start position:0%
what i think so for example i'm all oak
and<00:01:36.320><c> then</c><00:01:36.479><c> like</c><00:01:36.640><c> let's</c><00:01:36.880><c> just</c><00:01:37.040><c> call</c><00:01:37.200><c> the</c><00:01:37.280><c> mask</c>

00:01:37.590 --> 00:01:37.600 align:start position:0%
and then like let's just call the mask
 

00:01:37.600 --> 00:01:38.710 align:start position:0%
and then like let's just call the mask
dr<00:01:37.920><c> k</c>

00:01:38.710 --> 00:01:38.720 align:start position:0%
dr k
 

00:01:38.720 --> 00:01:40.069 align:start position:0%
dr k
and<00:01:38.880><c> so</c><00:01:39.040><c> what</c><00:01:39.200><c> i</c><00:01:39.280><c> start</c><00:01:39.439><c> to</c><00:01:39.600><c> think</c><00:01:39.759><c> is</c><00:01:39.920><c> oh</c>

00:01:40.069 --> 00:01:40.079 align:start position:0%
and so what i start to think is oh
 

00:01:40.079 --> 00:01:42.069 align:start position:0%
and so what i start to think is oh
people<00:01:40.400><c> like</c><00:01:40.720><c> dr</c><00:01:41.040><c> k</c><00:01:41.280><c> but</c><00:01:41.439><c> what</c><00:01:41.600><c> does</c><00:01:41.759><c> that</c><00:01:41.920><c> do</c>

00:01:42.069 --> 00:01:42.079 align:start position:0%
people like dr k but what does that do
 

00:01:42.079 --> 00:01:43.990 align:start position:0%
people like dr k but what does that do
to<00:01:42.320><c> my</c><00:01:42.640><c> confidence</c>

00:01:43.990 --> 00:01:44.000 align:start position:0%
to my confidence
 

00:01:44.000 --> 00:01:46.230 align:start position:0%
to my confidence
it<00:01:44.159><c> actually</c><00:01:44.560><c> doesn't</c><00:01:44.960><c> increase</c><00:01:45.360><c> it</c><00:01:45.520><c> at</c><00:01:45.680><c> all</c>

00:01:46.230 --> 00:01:46.240 align:start position:0%
it actually doesn't increase it at all
 

00:01:46.240 --> 00:01:47.749 align:start position:0%
it actually doesn't increase it at all
in<00:01:46.399><c> fact</c><00:01:46.640><c> it</c><00:01:46.720><c> can</c><00:01:46.880><c> make</c><00:01:47.040><c> me</c><00:01:47.200><c> even</c><00:01:47.439><c> more</c>

00:01:47.749 --> 00:01:47.759 align:start position:0%
in fact it can make me even more
 

00:01:47.759 --> 00:01:48.630 align:start position:0%
in fact it can make me even more
insecure

00:01:48.630 --> 00:01:48.640 align:start position:0%
insecure
 

00:01:48.640 --> 00:01:50.310 align:start position:0%
insecure
because<00:01:48.880><c> what</c><00:01:49.119><c> people</c><00:01:49.439><c> are</c><00:01:49.680><c> responding</c>

00:01:50.310 --> 00:01:50.320 align:start position:0%
because what people are responding
 

00:01:50.320 --> 00:01:52.389 align:start position:0%
because what people are responding
positively<00:01:51.040><c> to</c><00:01:51.600><c> is</c><00:01:51.759><c> dr</c><00:01:52.159><c> k</c>

00:01:52.389 --> 00:01:52.399 align:start position:0%
positively to is dr k
 

00:01:52.399 --> 00:01:54.550 align:start position:0%
positively to is dr k
and<00:01:52.560><c> is</c><00:01:52.640><c> not</c><00:01:52.799><c> alok</c><00:01:53.759><c> and</c><00:01:53.920><c> so</c><00:01:54.079><c> the</c><00:01:54.159><c> more</c><00:01:54.399><c> that</c>

00:01:54.550 --> 00:01:54.560 align:start position:0%
and is not alok and so the more that
 

00:01:54.560 --> 00:01:57.030 align:start position:0%
and is not alok and so the more that
this<00:01:54.799><c> happens</c><00:01:55.280><c> the</c><00:01:55.520><c> more</c><00:01:55.759><c> we</c><00:01:55.920><c> get</c><00:01:56.159><c> stuck</c>

00:01:57.030 --> 00:01:57.040 align:start position:0%
this happens the more we get stuck
 

00:01:57.040 --> 00:02:00.950 align:start position:0%
this happens the more we get stuck
so<00:01:57.280><c> now</c><00:01:57.520><c> i</c><00:01:57.759><c> know</c><00:01:58.960><c> that</c><00:01:59.200><c> people</c><00:01:59.520><c> like</c><00:01:59.840><c> dr</c><00:02:00.240><c> k</c>

00:02:00.950 --> 00:02:00.960 align:start position:0%
so now i know that people like dr k
 

00:02:00.960 --> 00:02:02.950 align:start position:0%
so now i know that people like dr k
and<00:02:01.200><c> i</c><00:02:01.439><c> think</c><00:02:01.759><c> that</c><00:02:01.920><c> they</c><00:02:02.079><c> may</c><00:02:02.320><c> not</c><00:02:02.560><c> like</c><00:02:02.719><c> me</c>

00:02:02.950 --> 00:02:02.960 align:start position:0%
and i think that they may not like me
 

00:02:02.960 --> 00:02:04.550 align:start position:0%
and i think that they may not like me
because<00:02:03.119><c> they</c><00:02:03.280><c> clearly</c><00:02:03.600><c> like</c><00:02:03.759><c> dr</c><00:02:04.079><c> k</c><00:02:04.240><c> what</c><00:02:04.399><c> if</c><00:02:04.479><c> i</c>

00:02:04.550 --> 00:02:04.560 align:start position:0%
because they clearly like dr k what if i
 

00:02:04.560 --> 00:02:05.749 align:start position:0%

00:14:46.870 --> 00:14:46.880 align:start position:0%
i hope we figure this out this is like
 

00:14:46.880 --> 00:14:49.269 align:start position:0%
i hope we figure this out this is like
this<00:14:47.199><c> is</c><00:14:47.360><c> basically</c><00:14:48.079><c> what</c><00:14:48.320><c> we</c><00:14:48.639><c> this</c><00:14:48.880><c> is</c><00:14:49.040><c> group</c>

00:14:49.269 --> 00:14:49.279 align:start position:0%
this is basically what we this is group
 

00:14:49.279 --> 00:14:52.949 align:start position:0%
this is basically what we this is group
coaching<00:14:49.600><c> happening</c><00:14:50.000><c> on</c><00:14:50.079><c> reddit</c>

00:14:52.949 --> 00:14:52.959 align:start position:0%
 
 

00:14:52.959 --> 00:14:54.389 align:start position:0%
 
right<00:14:53.199><c> and</c><00:14:53.279><c> then</c><00:14:53.440><c> like</c><00:14:53.680><c> this</c><00:14:53.839><c> person's</c><00:14:54.240><c> great</c>

00:14:54.389 --> 00:14:54.399 align:start position:0%
right and then like this person's great
 

00:14:54.399 --> 00:14:58.310 align:start position:0%
right and then like this person's great
too<00:14:54.560><c> why</c><00:14:54.720><c> do</c><00:14:54.800><c> you</c><00:14:54.880><c> have</c><00:14:54.959><c> to</c><00:14:55.040><c> put</c><00:14:55.199><c> a</c><00:14:55.279><c> mask</c><00:14:56.839><c> on</c>

00:14:58.310 --> 00:14:58.320 align:start position:0%
too why do you have to put a mask on
 

00:14:58.320 --> 00:14:59.990 align:start position:0%
too why do you have to put a mask on
and<00:14:58.480><c> so</c><00:14:58.639><c> this</c><00:14:58.800><c> is</c><00:14:58.880><c> what</c><00:14:59.040><c> the</c><00:14:59.199><c> aoe</c><00:14:59.519><c> healing</c><00:14:59.920><c> is</c>

00:14:59.990 --> 00:15:00.000 align:start position:0%
and so this is what the aoe healing is
 

00:15:00.000 --> 00:15:01.350 align:start position:0%
and so this is what the aoe healing is
about<00:15:00.399><c> like</c><00:15:00.720><c> we</c>

00:15:01.350 --> 00:15:01.360 align:start position:0%
about like we
 

00:15:01.360 --> 00:15:04.470 align:start position:0%
about like we
so<00:15:01.839><c> the</c><00:15:02.079><c> problem</c><00:15:02.399><c> is</c><00:15:02.560><c> that</c><00:15:03.279><c> you</c><00:15:03.360><c> know</c>

00:15:04.470 --> 00:15:04.480 align:start position:0%
so the problem is that you know
 

00:15:04.480 --> 00:15:06.710 align:start position:0%
so the problem is that you know
