teach them some of these techniques that

but what most of clinical psychology
training<00:10:27.760><c> is</c><00:10:28.000><c> if</c><00:10:28.079><c> you</c><00:10:28.240><c> think</c><00:10:28.399><c> about</c><00:10:28.720><c> it</c>

00:10:29.110 --> 00:10:29.120 align:start position:0%
training is if you think about it
 

00:10:29.120 --> 00:10:32.790 align:start position:0%
training is if you think about it

00:10:36.550 --> 00:10:36.560 align:start position:0%
like
 

00:10:36.560 --> 00:10:39.269 align:start position:0%
like
like<00:10:36.959><c> it's</c><00:10:37.279><c> like</c><00:10:37.440><c> mostly</c><00:10:37.839><c> theoretical</c><00:10:39.120><c> so</c>

00:10:39.269 --> 00:10:39.279 align:start position:0%
like it's like mostly theoretical so
 

00:10:39.279 --> 00:10:40.630 align:start position:0%
like it's like mostly theoretical so
like<00:10:39.519><c> you'll</c><00:10:39.680><c> do</c><00:10:39.839><c> supervision</c><00:10:40.399><c> and</c><00:10:40.480><c> stuff</c>

00:10:40.630 --> 00:10:40.640 align:start position:0%

like that which is great
 

00:10:41.680 --> 00:10:42.870 align:start position:0%
like that which is great

00:10:42.870 --> 00:10:42.880 align:start position:0%
that's where all the real learning
 

00:10:42.880 --> 00:10:45.110 align:start position:0%
that's where all the real learning
happens<00:10:43.839><c> but</c><00:10:44.000><c> this</c><00:10:44.160><c> is</c><00:10:44.320><c> why</c><00:10:44.480><c> like</c><00:10:44.640><c> in</c><00:10:44.800><c> medical</c>

00:10:45.110 --> 00:10:45.120 align:start position:0%
happens but this is why like in medical
 

00:10:45.120 --> 00:10:46.470 align:start position:0%
happens but this is why like in medical
school<00:10:45.360><c> you</c><00:10:45.519><c> have</c><00:10:45.600><c> four</c><00:10:45.839><c> years</c><00:10:46.079><c> of</c><00:10:46.160><c> medical</c>

00:10:49.590 --> 00:10:49.600 align:start position:0%
like you learn a lot of theory and then
 

00:10:49.600 --> 00:10:50.949 align:start position:0%
like you learn a lot of theory and then
you<00:10:49.680><c> do</c><00:10:49.839><c> residency</c><00:10:50.399><c> where</c><00:10:50.480><c> you</c><00:10:50.560><c> learn</c><00:10:50.800><c> how</c><00:10:50.880><c> to</c>

00:10:58.839 --> 00:11:01.990 align:start position:0%
 
okay

00:11:01.990 --> 00:11:02.000 align:start position:0%
 
 

00:11:02.000 --> 00:11:03.910 align:start position:0%
 
so<00:11:02.320><c> if</c><00:11:02.480><c> you</c><00:11:02.560><c> want</c><00:11:02.720><c> to</c><00:11:02.880><c> stop</c><00:11:03.120><c> caring</c><00:11:03.519><c> i'm</c><00:11:03.760><c> i'm</c>

put the brakes on your brain and you
