00:06:17.270 --> 00:06:17.280 align:start position:0%
that you should look out for or
 

00:06:17.280 --> 00:06:20.710 align:start position:0%
that you should look out for or
like<00:06:17.520><c> it</c><00:06:17.680><c> does</c><00:06:17.840><c> it</c><00:06:17.919><c> depend</c><00:06:18.160><c> on</c><00:06:18.319><c> the</c><00:06:18.840><c> problem</c>

00:06:20.710 --> 00:06:20.720 align:start position:0%
like it does it depend on the problem
 

00:06:20.720 --> 00:06:23.909 align:start position:0%
like it does it depend on the problem
uh<00:06:21.680><c> so</c>

00:06:23.909 --> 00:06:23.919 align:start position:0%
 
 

00:06:23.919 --> 00:06:26.390 align:start position:0%
 
i<00:06:24.080><c> think</c><00:06:24.319><c> you</c><00:06:24.479><c> should</c><00:06:25.280><c> should</c><00:06:25.520><c> try</c><00:06:25.919><c> a</c><00:06:26.000><c> couple</c>

00:06:26.390 --> 00:06:26.400 align:start position:0%
i think you should should try a couple
 

00:06:26.400 --> 00:06:27.110 align:start position:0%
i think you should should try a couple
of<00:06:26.560><c> things</c>

00:06:27.110 --> 00:06:27.120 align:start position:0%
of things
 

00:06:27.120 --> 00:06:29.430 align:start position:0%
of things
so<00:06:27.520><c> some</c><00:06:27.759><c> kinds</c><00:06:28.080><c> of</c><00:06:28.240><c> therapy</c><00:06:28.639><c> are</c><00:06:28.800><c> very</c><00:06:29.120><c> very</c>

00:06:29.430 --> 00:06:29.440 align:start position:0%
so some kinds of therapy are very very
 

00:06:29.440 --> 00:06:30.550 align:start position:0%
so some kinds of therapy are very very
different

00:06:30.550 --> 00:06:30.560 align:start position:0%
different
 

00:06:30.560 --> 00:06:35.350 align:start position:0%
different
um<00:06:30.960><c> so</c><00:06:31.440><c> a</c><00:06:31.600><c> good</c><00:06:31.919><c> like</c><00:06:33.039><c> kind</c><00:06:33.199><c> of</c><00:06:33.280><c> like</c>

00:06:35.350 --> 00:06:35.360 align:start position:0%
um so a good like kind of like
 

00:06:35.360 --> 00:06:37.909 align:start position:0%
um so a good like kind of like
division<00:06:36.160><c> is</c><00:06:36.560><c> there's</c><00:06:36.880><c> a</c><00:06:36.960><c> branch</c><00:06:37.360><c> of</c><00:06:37.520><c> therapy</c>

00:08:47.430 --> 00:08:47.440 align:start position:0%
out for that would kind of
 

00:08:47.440 --> 00:08:50.870 align:start position:0%
out for that would kind of
say<00:08:47.680><c> you</c><00:08:47.839><c> should</c><00:08:48.000><c> go</c><00:08:48.240><c> to</c><00:08:48.399><c> a</c><00:08:48.560><c> therapist</c>

00:08:54.310 --> 00:08:54.320 align:start position:0%
yeah so that's a great question so let's
 

00:08:54.320 --> 00:08:55.990 align:start position:0%
yeah so that's a great question so let's
start<00:08:54.560><c> by</c><00:08:54.720><c> remembering</c><00:08:55.200><c> that</c><00:08:55.440><c> going</c><00:08:55.680><c> to</c><00:08:55.839><c> a</c>

00:08:55.990 --> 00:08:56.000 align:start position:0%
start by remembering that going to a
 

00:08:56.000 --> 00:08:57.350 align:start position:0%
start by remembering that going to a
therapist<00:08:56.720><c> is</c><00:08:56.959><c> not</c>

00:08:57.350 --> 00:08:57.360 align:start position:0%
therapist is not
 

00:08:57.360 --> 00:09:00.070 align:start position:0%
therapist is not
about<00:08:58.000><c> treating</c><00:08:58.480><c> something</c><00:08:59.440><c> it's</c><00:08:59.680><c> about</c>

00:09:00.070 --> 00:09:00.080 align:start position:0%
about treating something it's about
 

00:09:00.080 --> 00:09:02.310 align:start position:0%
about treating something it's about
getting<00:09:00.480><c> something</c><00:09:00.880><c> checked</c><00:09:01.200><c> out</c>

00:09:02.310 --> 00:09:02.320 align:start position:0%
getting something checked out
 

00:09:02.320 --> 00:09:04.310 align:start position:0%
getting something checked out
right<00:09:02.560><c> so</c><00:09:02.800><c> if</c><00:09:02.959><c> you</c><00:09:03.120><c> have</c><00:09:03.279><c> a</c><00:09:03.440><c> lump</c><00:09:03.920><c> it</c><00:09:04.080><c> doesn't</c>

00:09:04.310 --> 00:09:04.320 align:start position:0%
right so if you have a lump it doesn't
 

00:09:04.320 --> 00:09:06.150 align:start position:0%
right so if you have a lump it doesn't
mean<00:09:04.480><c> you</c><00:09:04.640><c> have</c><00:09:04.800><c> cancer</c><00:09:05.279><c> it</c><00:09:05.440><c> just</c><00:09:05.680><c> means</c><00:09:06.000><c> that</c>

00:09:06.150 --> 00:09:06.160 align:start position:0%
mean you have cancer it just means that
 

00:09:06.160 --> 00:09:08.470 align:start position:0%
mean you have cancer it just means that
you<00:09:06.320><c> should</c><00:09:06.560><c> get</c><00:09:06.800><c> someone</c><00:09:07.279><c> who</c><00:09:07.519><c> knows</c>

00:09:08.470 --> 00:09:08.480 align:start position:0%
you should get someone who knows
 

00:09:08.480 --> 00:09:10.790 align:start position:0%
you should get someone who knows
to<00:09:08.640><c> take</c><00:09:08.880><c> a</c><00:09:09.040><c> look</c><00:09:09.279><c> at</c><00:09:09.440><c> it</c><00:09:09.920><c> so</c><00:09:10.080><c> that</c><00:09:10.399><c> they</c><00:09:10.640><c> can</c>

00:09:10.790 --> 00:09:10.800 align:start position:0%
to take a look at it so that they can
 

00:09:10.800 --> 00:09:12.310 align:start position:0%
to take a look at it so that they can
tell<00:09:11.040><c> you</c><00:09:11.200><c> whether</c><00:09:11.440><c> it's</c><00:09:11.600><c> cancer</c><00:09:12.000><c> or</c><00:09:12.080><c> not</c>

00:09:12.310 --> 00:09:12.320 align:start position:0%
tell you whether it's cancer or not
 

00:09:12.320 --> 00:09:14.389 align:start position:0%
tell you whether it's cancer or not
cancer

00:09:14.389 --> 00:09:14.399 align:start position:0%
cancer
 

00:09:14.399 --> 00:09:16.550 align:start position:0%
cancer
so<00:09:14.560><c> i</c><00:09:14.640><c> would</c><00:09:14.800><c> say</c><00:09:14.959><c> therapy</c><00:09:15.360><c> is</c><00:09:15.519><c> the</c><00:09:15.680><c> same</c><00:09:15.920><c> way</c>

00:09:16.550 --> 00:09:16.560 align:start position:0%
so i would say therapy is the same way
 

00:09:16.560 --> 00:09:17.430 align:start position:0%
so i would say therapy is the same way
so<00:09:16.720><c> if</c><00:09:16.880><c> you</c><00:09:17.040><c> don't</c>

00:09:17.430 --> 00:09:17.440 align:start position:0%
so if you don't
 

00:09:17.440 --> 00:09:19.590 align:start position:0%
so if you don't
know<00:09:17.760><c> like</c><00:09:18.000><c> if</c><00:09:18.080><c> you're</c><00:09:18.320><c> feeling</c><00:09:18.720><c> sad</c><00:09:19.120><c> or</c><00:09:19.279><c> down</c>

and i'd say that like if you're
suffering<00:10:09.519><c> or</c><00:10:09.760><c> struggling</c>

suffering or struggling
 

00:10:10.560 --> 00:10:13.030 align:start position:0%
suffering or struggling
or<00:10:10.720><c> you</c><00:10:11.040><c> feel</c><00:10:11.360><c> like</c><00:10:11.600><c> you're</c><00:10:11.839><c> not</c><00:10:12.160><c> able</c><00:10:12.480><c> to</c><00:10:12.720><c> do</c>

00:10:16.069 --> 00:10:16.079 align:start position:0%
then i think that's another reason to
 

00:10:16.079 --> 00:10:18.150 align:start position:0%
then i think that's another reason to
get<00:10:16.240><c> an</c><00:10:16.839><c> evaluation</c>

00:10:18.150 --> 00:10:18.160 align:start position:0%
get an evaluation
 

00:10:18.160 --> 00:10:20.710 align:start position:0%

00:10:20.720 --> 00:10:22.630 align:start position:0%
so in psychiatry what we look at is
impairment<00:10:21.279><c> of</c><00:10:21.519><c> function</c>

of diy mental health
 

00:15:46.959 --> 00:15:51.030 align:start position:0%
of diy mental health
yeah<00:15:47.279><c> so</c><00:15:47.759><c> i</c><00:15:47.920><c> think</c><00:15:48.079><c> that</c><00:15:48.240><c> that's</c><00:15:49.440><c> reasonable</c>

00:15:51.030 --> 00:15:51.040 align:start position:0%
yeah so i think that that's reasonable
 

00:15:51.040 --> 00:15:53.269 align:start position:0%
yeah so i think that that's reasonable
but<00:15:51.759><c> you</c><00:15:52.000><c> should</c><00:15:52.240><c> still</c><00:15:52.560><c> probably</c><00:15:53.040><c> get</c>

00:15:53.269 --> 00:15:53.279 align:start position:0%
but you should still probably get
 

00:15:53.279 --> 00:15:55.430 align:start position:0%
but you should still probably get
evaluated

00:15:55.430 --> 00:15:55.440 align:start position:0%
evaluated
 

00:15:55.440 --> 00:15:58.389 align:start position:0%
evaluated
so<00:15:55.600><c> i</c><00:15:55.759><c> don't</c><00:15:55.920><c> think</c><00:15:56.160><c> that</c><00:15:56.480><c> mental</c><00:15:57.040><c> health</c><00:15:58.000><c> is</c>

00:15:58.389 --> 00:15:58.399 align:start position:0%
so i don't think that mental health is
 

00:15:58.399 --> 00:15:59.430 align:start position:0%
so i don't think that mental health is
all

00:15:59.430 --> 00:15:59.440 align:start position:0%

00:16:17.269 --> 00:16:17.279 align:start position:0%
treatment and so i think that that's
 

00:16:17.279 --> 00:16:17.749 align:start position:0%
treatment and so i think that that's
okay

00:16:17.749 --> 00:16:17.759 align:start position:0%
okay
 

00:16:17.759 --> 00:16:19.670 align:start position:0%
okay
but<00:16:17.920><c> like</c><00:16:18.160><c> i</c><00:16:18.240><c> think</c><00:16:18.399><c> that</c><00:16:18.639><c> if</c><00:16:18.800><c> you're</c><00:16:19.199><c> the</c><00:16:19.360><c> real</c>

00:20:18.559 --> 00:20:21.510 align:start position:0%
 
and<00:20:19.120><c> and</c><00:20:19.280><c> so</c><00:20:19.679><c> like</c><00:20:19.919><c> all</c><00:20:20.159><c> you</c><00:20:20.400><c> know</c><00:20:20.720><c> is</c><00:20:20.960><c> failure</c>

00:20:21.510 --> 00:20:21.520 align:start position:0%
and and so like all you know is failure
 

00:20:21.520 --> 00:20:22.149 align:start position:0%
and and so like all you know is failure
then<00:20:21.760><c> like</c>

00:20:22.149 --> 00:20:22.159 align:start position:0%
then like
 

00:20:22.159 --> 00:20:24.390 align:start position:0%
then like
it's<00:20:22.400><c> hard</c><00:20:22.720><c> for</c><00:20:22.960><c> you</c><00:20:23.120><c> to</c><00:20:23.360><c> by</c><00:20:23.600><c> yourself</c><00:20:24.159><c> kind</c><00:20:24.320><c> of</c>

00:20:24.390 --> 00:20:24.400 align:start position:0%
it's hard for you to by yourself kind of
 

00:20:24.400 --> 00:20:25.750 align:start position:0%
it's hard for you to by yourself kind of
come<00:20:24.640><c> out</c><00:20:24.799><c> of</c><00:20:24.880><c> that</c>

00:20:25.750 --> 00:20:25.760 align:start position:0%
come out of that
 

00:20:25.760 --> 00:20:27.029 align:start position:0%
come out of that
so<00:20:25.919><c> i</c><00:20:26.000><c> guess</c><00:20:26.159><c> what</c><00:20:26.320><c> i</c><00:20:26.400><c> would</c><00:20:26.559><c> tell</c><00:20:26.799><c> those</c>

00:20:27.029 --> 00:20:27.039 align:start position:0%
so i guess what i would tell those
 

00:20:27.039 --> 00:20:29.190 align:start position:0%
so i guess what i would tell those
people<00:20:27.760><c> is</c><00:20:28.000><c> understand</c><00:20:28.480><c> that</c><00:20:28.640><c> like</c><00:20:28.799><c> that's</c>

00:20:29.190 --> 00:20:29.200 align:start position:0%
people is understand that like that's
 

00:20:29.200 --> 00:20:31.430 align:start position:0%
people is understand that like that's
your<00:20:29.600><c> experience</c>

i think that explains it
um<00:23:12.400><c> switching</c><00:23:12.799><c> gears</c><00:23:13.039><c> a</c><00:23:13.120><c> little</c><00:23:13.280><c> bit</c><00:23:13.520><c> i</c><00:23:13.760><c> was</c>

um switching gears a little bit i was
 

00:23:14.080 --> 00:23:16.230 align:start position:0%
um switching gears a little bit i was
wondering<00:23:14.480><c> if</c><00:23:14.640><c> there's</c><00:23:14.880><c> any</c><00:23:15.200><c> limitations</c><00:23:16.080><c> to</c>

00:23:16.230 --> 00:23:16.240 align:start position:0%
wondering if there's any limitations to
 

00:23:16.240 --> 00:23:17.190 align:start position:0%
wondering if there's any limitations to
therapy

00:23:17.190 --> 00:23:17.200 align:start position:0%
therapy
 

00:23:17.200 --> 00:23:20.549 align:start position:0%
therapy
or<00:23:17.679><c> like</c><00:23:18.480><c> i'll</c><00:23:18.960><c> start</c><00:23:19.200><c> there</c><00:23:19.600><c> yeah</c>

00:23:20.549 --> 00:23:20.559 align:start position:0%

00:23:20.559 --> 00:23:22.149 align:start position:0%
or like i'll start there yeah
yeah<00:23:20.720><c> so</c><00:23:20.880><c> i'd</c><00:23:21.039><c> say</c><00:23:21.200><c> the</c><00:23:21.280><c> biggest</c><00:23:21.600><c> limitation</c>

00:23:22.149 --> 00:23:22.159 align:start position:0%
yeah so i'd say the biggest limitation
 

00:23:22.159 --> 00:23:23.669 align:start position:0%
yeah so i'd say the biggest limitation
to<00:23:22.320><c> therapy</c><00:23:22.720><c> is</c><00:23:22.799><c> therapy</c><00:23:23.200><c> is</c><00:23:23.280><c> not</c><00:23:23.440><c> going</c><00:23:23.520><c> to</c>

00:23:23.669 --> 00:23:23.679 align:start position:0%

so<00:23:26.880><c> like</c><00:23:27.200><c> therapy</c><00:23:27.679><c> is</c><00:23:27.840><c> like</c><00:23:28.480><c> you</c><00:23:28.640><c> know</c><00:23:29.200><c> like</c>

00:25:40.470 --> 00:25:40.480 align:start position:0%
yeah so one thought that i would have is
 

00:25:40.480 --> 00:25:42.470 align:start position:0%
yeah so one thought that i would have is
that<00:25:40.799><c> if</c><00:25:40.960><c> you're</c><00:25:41.200><c> doing</c><00:25:41.520><c> therapy</c><00:25:41.919><c> for</c><00:25:42.000><c> a</c><00:25:42.159><c> while</c>

00:25:42.470 --> 00:25:42.480 align:start position:0%
that if you're doing therapy for a while
 

00:25:42.480 --> 00:25:44.070 align:start position:0%
that if you're doing therapy for a while
and<00:25:42.640><c> it</c><00:25:42.720><c> doesn't</c><00:25:42.960><c> feel</c><00:25:43.200><c> like</c><00:25:43.360><c> it's</c><00:25:43.520><c> working</c><00:25:43.919><c> or</c>

00:25:44.070 --> 00:25:44.080 align:start position:0%
and it doesn't feel like it's working or
 

00:25:44.080 --> 00:25:45.510 align:start position:0%
and it doesn't feel like it's working or
helping

00:25:45.510 --> 00:25:45.520 align:start position:0%
helping
 

00:25:45.520 --> 00:25:47.029 align:start position:0%
helping
then<00:25:45.919><c> consider</c><00:25:46.400><c> finding</c><00:25:46.720><c> a</c><00:25:46.799><c> different</c>

00:25:47.029 --> 00:25:47.039 align:start position:0%
then consider finding a different
 

00:25:47.039 --> 00:25:49.350 align:start position:0%
then consider finding a different
therapist

00:25:49.350 --> 00:25:49.360 align:start position:0%
therapist
 

00:25:49.360 --> 00:25:52.390 align:start position:0%
therapist
and<00:25:50.880><c> the</c><00:25:51.120><c> other</c><00:25:51.440><c> problem</c><00:25:51.919><c> i</c><00:25:52.080><c> guess</c>

00:25:52.390 --> 00:25:52.400 align:start position:0%
and the other problem i guess
 

00:25:52.400 --> 00:25:54.310 align:start position:0%
and the other problem i guess
with<00:25:52.559><c> therapy</c><00:25:52.960><c> is</c><00:25:53.039><c> kind</c><00:25:53.200><c> of</c><00:25:53.520><c> contrary</c><00:25:54.000><c> to</c><00:25:54.080><c> that</c>

00:25:54.310 --> 00:25:54.320 align:start position:0%
with therapy is kind of contrary to that
 

00:25:54.320 --> 00:25:56.630 align:start position:0%
with therapy is kind of contrary to that
is<00:25:54.400><c> that</c><00:25:54.880><c> sometimes</c><00:25:55.440><c> it</c><00:25:55.520><c> can</c><00:25:55.679><c> be</c><00:25:55.919><c> hard</c><00:25:56.240><c> to</c><00:25:56.400><c> see</c>

00:25:56.630 --> 00:25:56.640 align:start position:0%
is that sometimes it can be hard to see
 

00:25:56.640 --> 00:25:58.149 align:start position:0%
is that sometimes it can be hard to see
change

00:25:58.149 --> 00:25:58.159 align:start position:0%
change
 

00:25:58.159 --> 00:26:00.310 align:start position:0%
change
so<00:25:58.400><c> they're</c><00:25:58.640><c> like</c><00:25:59.279><c> change</c><00:25:59.600><c> over</c><00:25:59.919><c> therapy</c>

00:26:00.310 --> 00:26:00.320 align:start position:0%
so they're like change over therapy
 

00:26:00.320 --> 00:26:01.909 align:start position:0%
so they're like change over therapy
happens<00:26:00.720><c> slowly</c><00:26:01.200><c> and</c><00:26:01.279><c> you</c><00:26:01.440><c> don't</c><00:26:01.600><c> really</c>

00:26:01.909 --> 00:26:01.919 align:start position:0%
happens slowly and you don't really
 

00:26:01.919 --> 00:26:03.029 align:start position:0%
happens slowly and you don't really
notice<00:26:02.320><c> it</c>

00:26:03.029 --> 00:26:03.039 align:start position:0%
notice it
 

00:26:03.039 --> 00:26:04.470 align:start position:0%
notice it
so<00:26:03.200><c> it's</c><00:26:03.360><c> kind</c><00:26:03.520><c> of</c><00:26:03.600><c> like</c><00:26:03.760><c> you</c><00:26:03.840><c> wake</c><00:26:04.159><c> up</c><00:26:04.240><c> and</c><00:26:04.400><c> you</c>

00:26:04.470 --> 00:26:04.480 align:start position:0%
so it's kind of like you wake up and you
 

00:26:04.480 --> 00:26:05.750 align:start position:0%
so it's kind of like you wake up and you
look<00:26:04.640><c> at</c><00:26:04.720><c> yourself</c><00:26:05.039><c> in</c><00:26:05.120><c> the</c><00:26:05.200><c> mirror</c><00:26:05.520><c> every</c>

00:26:05.750 --> 00:26:05.760 align:start position:0%
look at yourself in the mirror every
 

00:26:05.760 --> 00:26:07.350 align:start position:0%
look at yourself in the mirror every
morning<00:26:06.080><c> and</c><00:26:06.240><c> you</c><00:26:06.400><c> look</c><00:26:06.559><c> the</c><00:26:06.640><c> same</c><00:26:06.880><c> as</c><00:26:07.039><c> you</c><00:26:07.200><c> did</c>

00:26:07.350 --> 00:26:07.360 align:start position:0%
morning and you look the same as you did
 

00:26:07.360 --> 00:26:08.630 align:start position:0%
morning and you look the same as you did
the<00:26:07.440><c> day</c><00:26:07.600><c> before</c>

00:26:08.630 --> 00:26:08.640 align:start position:0%
the day before
 

00:26:08.640 --> 00:26:09.830 align:start position:0%
the day before
but<00:26:08.799><c> then</c><00:26:09.039><c> you</c><00:26:09.120><c> look</c><00:26:09.279><c> at</c><00:26:09.360><c> a</c><00:26:09.440><c> picture</c><00:26:09.760><c> of</c>

00:26:09.830 --> 00:26:09.840 align:start position:0%
but then you look at a picture of
 

00:26:09.840 --> 00:26:11.350 align:start position:0%
but then you look at a picture of
yourself<00:26:10.240><c> five</c><00:26:10.480><c> years</c><00:26:10.720><c> ago</c><00:26:10.960><c> and</c><00:26:11.120><c> you</c><00:26:11.200><c> look</c>

00:26:11.350 --> 00:26:11.360 align:start position:0%
yourself five years ago and you look
 

00:26:11.360 --> 00:26:13.269 align:start position:0%
yourself five years ago and you look
like<00:26:11.520><c> a</c><00:26:11.600><c> completely</c><00:26:12.000><c> different</c><00:26:12.240><c> person</c>

00:26:13.269 --> 00:26:13.279 align:start position:0%
like a completely different person
 

00:26:13.279 --> 00:26:17.350 align:start position:0%
like a completely different person
so<00:26:13.520><c> therapy</c><00:26:13.840><c> is</c><00:26:14.000><c> the</c><00:26:14.080><c> same</c><00:26:14.320><c> way</c><00:26:16.000><c> where</c>

00:26:17.350 --> 00:26:17.360 align:start position:0%
so therapy is the same way where
 

00:26:17.360 --> 00:26:19.190 align:start position:0%
so therapy is the same way where
you<00:26:17.440><c> know</c><00:26:17.600><c> you</c><00:26:17.760><c> can</c><00:26:18.240><c> like</c><00:26:18.400><c> it</c><00:26:18.559><c> can</c><00:26:18.720><c> feel</c><00:26:18.880><c> like</c><00:26:19.120><c> a</c>

00:26:19.190 --> 00:26:19.200 align:start position:0%
you know you can like it can feel like a
 

00:26:19.200 --> 00:26:20.390 align:start position:0%
you know you can like it can feel like a
problem<00:26:19.520><c> it</c><00:26:19.600><c> can</c><00:26:19.840><c> feel</c><00:26:20.000><c> like</c><00:26:20.080><c> you're</c><00:26:20.240><c> not</c>

00:26:20.390 --> 00:26:20.400 align:start position:0%
problem it can feel like you're not
 

00:26:20.400 --> 00:26:21.430 align:start position:0%
problem it can feel like you're not
making<00:26:20.720><c> any</c><00:26:20.880><c> progress</c>

00:26:21.430 --> 00:26:21.440 align:start position:0%
making any progress
 

00:26:21.440 --> 00:26:24.470 align:start position:0%
making any progress
even<00:26:21.600><c> though</c><00:26:21.760><c> you</c><00:26:22.840><c> are</c>

00:26:24.470 --> 00:26:24.480 align:start position:0%
even though you are
 

00:26:24.480 --> 00:26:27.350 align:start position:0%
even though you are
which<00:26:24.720><c> can</c><00:26:24.880><c> be</c><00:26:25.200><c> part</c><00:26:25.360><c> of</c><00:26:25.440><c> the</c><00:26:25.520><c> problem</c><00:26:26.159><c> but</c>

00:26:27.350 --> 00:26:27.360 align:start position:0%
which can be part of the problem but
 

00:26:27.360 --> 00:26:29.110 align:start position:0%
which can be part of the problem but
yeah<00:26:27.600><c> so</c><00:26:27.760><c> i'd</c><00:26:27.919><c> say</c><00:26:28.080><c> that's</c><00:26:28.240><c> another</c><00:26:28.640><c> just</c>

00:26:29.110 --> 00:26:29.120 align:start position:0%
yeah so i'd say that's another just
 

00:26:29.120 --> 00:26:30.789 align:start position:0%
yeah so i'd say that's another just
a<00:26:29.279><c> caution</c><00:26:29.679><c> about</c><00:26:29.919><c> therapy</c><00:26:30.240><c> more</c><00:26:30.400><c> so</c><00:26:30.559><c> than</c><00:26:30.720><c> a</c>

00:26:30.789 --> 00:26:30.799 align:start position:0%
a caution about therapy more so than a
 

00:26:30.799 --> 00:26:33.029 align:start position:0%
a caution about therapy more so than a
limitation<00:26:32.000><c> that</c><00:26:32.240><c> you</c><00:26:32.320><c> may</c><00:26:32.480><c> not</c><00:26:32.640><c> be</c><00:26:32.799><c> able</c><00:26:32.960><c> to</c>
