you're not if you're not growing you're

00:07:05.510 --> 00:07:05.520 align:start position:0%
dying then what happens is you're like i
 

00:07:05.520 --> 00:07:07.430 align:start position:0%

don't<00:07:05.680><c> know</c><00:07:05.919><c> how</c><00:07:06.080><c> to</c><00:07:06.240><c> consistently</c><00:07:06.880><c> grow</c>

00:07:07.430 --> 00:07:07.440 align:start position:0%
don't know how to consistently grow
 

00:07:07.440 --> 00:07:08.950 align:start position:0%
don't know how to consistently grow
right<00:07:07.919><c> and</c><00:07:08.000><c> this</c><00:07:08.160><c> is</c><00:07:08.240><c> where</c><00:07:08.400><c> the</c><00:07:08.479><c> first</c><00:07:08.720><c> phase</c>

00:07:08.950 --> 00:07:08.960 align:start position:0%

uh<00:07:10.720><c> kind</c><00:07:10.880><c> of</c><00:07:10.960><c> happens</c><00:07:11.840><c> which</c><00:07:12.080><c> is</c><00:07:12.160><c> like</c><00:07:12.400><c> i</c><00:07:12.639><c> can't</c>

00:07:12.950 --> 00:07:12.960 align:start position:0%
uh kind of happens which is like i can't
 

00:07:12.960 --> 00:07:14.710 align:start position:0%
uh kind of happens which is like i can't

00:07:14.710 --> 00:07:14.720 align:start position:0%
consistently grow i don't know what this
 

00:07:14.720 --> 00:07:17.670 align:start position:0%
consistently grow i don't know what this
formula<00:07:15.280><c> is</c><00:07:16.160><c> but</c><00:07:16.319><c> what</c><00:07:16.479><c> i</c><00:07:16.639><c> can</c><00:07:17.039><c> control</c><00:07:17.440><c> what</c>

00:07:17.670 --> 00:07:17.680 align:start position:0%
formula is but what i can control what
 

00:07:17.680 --> 00:07:19.830 align:start position:0%
formula is but what i can control what
is<00:07:17.759><c> within</c><00:07:18.160><c> my</c><00:07:18.319><c> control</c><00:07:18.880><c> to</c><00:07:19.120><c> affect</c><00:07:19.440><c> growing</c>

00:07:19.830 --> 00:07:19.840 align:start position:0%
is within my control to affect growing
 

00:07:19.840 --> 00:07:22.070 align:start position:0%
is within my control to affect growing
or<00:07:19.919><c> dying</c><00:07:20.319><c> is</c><00:07:20.479><c> how</c><00:07:20.639><c> much</c><00:07:20.880><c> i</c><00:07:21.039><c> stream</c>

00:07:22.070 --> 00:07:22.080 align:start position:0%

do this if i do that if i just stream
 

00:07:30.319 --> 00:07:32.790 align:start position:0%
do this if i do that if i just stream
more<00:07:30.639><c> if</c><00:07:30.800><c> i</c><00:07:30.960><c> give</c><00:07:31.280><c> more</c><00:07:31.599><c> of</c><00:07:31.759><c> myself</c><00:07:32.319><c> to</c><00:07:32.479><c> this</c>

then<00:07:33.840><c> my</c><00:07:34.080><c> chances</c><00:07:34.479><c> of</c><00:07:34.639><c> growing</c><00:07:34.960><c> are</c><00:07:35.120><c> greater</c>

00:07:35.350 --> 00:07:35.360 align:start position:0%
then my chances of growing are greater
 

00:07:35.360 --> 00:07:37.029 align:start position:0%

00:07:38.550 --> 00:07:38.560 align:start position:0%

00:07:41.110 --> 00:07:41.120 align:start position:0%
streamers is that i can increase the

amount of time i spend on something to

00:07:44.550 --> 00:07:44.560 align:start position:0%
become more successful
 

00:07:44.560 --> 00:07:46.390 align:start position:0%
become more successful

00:07:46.390 --> 00:07:46.400 align:start position:0%
so they start to give of themselves to

so they start to give of themselves to

00:17:26.630 --> 00:17:26.640 align:start position:0%
right we've already done it it's it's
 

00:17:26.640 --> 00:17:28.549 align:start position:0%
right we've already done it it's it's
there

00:17:28.549 --> 00:17:28.559 align:start position:0%
there
 

00:17:28.559 --> 00:17:30.830 align:start position:0%
there
and<00:17:28.720><c> so</c><00:17:28.880><c> now</c><00:17:29.039><c> that</c><00:17:29.200><c> we've</c><00:17:29.440><c> like</c><00:17:29.840><c> kind</c><00:17:30.000><c> of</c><00:17:30.080><c> done</c>

00:17:30.830 --> 00:17:30.840 align:start position:0%
and so now that we've like kind of done
 

00:17:30.840 --> 00:17:33.909 align:start position:0%
and so now that we've like kind of done
this<00:17:31.919><c> it's</c><00:17:32.160><c> like</c><00:17:32.880><c> messing</c><00:17:33.280><c> up</c><00:17:33.440><c> our</c><00:17:33.520><c> society</c>

00:17:35.190 --> 00:17:35.200 align:start position:0%
it's kind of bizarre
 

00:17:35.200 --> 00:17:36.630 align:start position:0%
it's kind of bizarre
we've<00:17:35.360><c> done</c><00:17:35.520><c> it</c><00:17:35.679><c> already</c>

00:17:36.630 --> 00:17:36.640 align:start position:0%
we've done it already
 

00:17:36.640 --> 00:17:39.590 align:start position:0%
we've done it already
and<00:17:36.799><c> so</c><00:17:36.960><c> now</c><00:17:37.200><c> you've</c><00:17:37.440><c> got</c><00:17:37.840><c> streamers</c><00:17:38.480><c> that</c><00:17:38.720><c> are</c>
