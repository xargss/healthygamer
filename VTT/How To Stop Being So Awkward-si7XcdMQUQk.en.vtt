that<00:01:33.680><c> makes</c><00:01:34.000><c> it</c><00:01:34.320><c> come</c><00:01:34.560><c> up</c><00:01:34.720><c> with</c><00:01:34.880><c> a</c><00:01:34.960><c> blank</c>

00:01:35.670 --> 00:01:35.680 align:start position:0%
that makes it come up with a blank
 

00:01:35.680 --> 00:01:37.030 align:start position:0%
that makes it come up with a blank
because<00:01:35.840><c> here's</c><00:01:36.159><c> the</c><00:01:36.320><c> problem</c><00:01:36.640><c> right</c><00:01:36.880><c> like</c>

00:01:37.030 --> 00:01:37.040 align:start position:0%
because here's the problem right like
 

00:01:37.040 --> 00:01:38.870 align:start position:0%
because here's the problem right like
when<00:01:37.200><c> you</c><00:01:37.360><c> try</c><00:01:37.600><c> to</c><00:01:37.759><c> socialize</c>

00:01:38.870 --> 00:01:38.880 align:start position:0%
when you try to socialize
 

00:01:38.880 --> 00:01:41.030 align:start position:0%
when you try to socialize
your<00:01:39.119><c> brain</c><00:01:39.360><c> draws</c><00:01:39.600><c> a</c><00:01:39.759><c> blink</c>

00:01:41.030 --> 00:01:41.040 align:start position:0%
your brain draws a blink
 

00:01:41.040 --> 00:01:42.630 align:start position:0%
your brain draws a blink
and<00:01:41.200><c> so</c><00:01:41.280><c> it</c><00:01:41.360><c> becomes</c><00:01:41.680><c> really</c><00:01:42.000><c> really</c><00:01:42.240><c> hard</c><00:01:42.479><c> to</c>

00:01:42.630 --> 00:01:42.640 align:start position:0%
and so it becomes really really hard to
 

00:01:42.640 --> 00:01:43.990 align:start position:0%
and so it becomes really really hard to
socialize<00:01:43.119><c> if</c><00:01:43.280><c> your</c><00:01:43.360><c> brain</c><00:01:43.600><c> is</c><00:01:43.680><c> drawing</c><00:01:43.920><c> a</c>

00:01:43.990 --> 00:01:44.000 align:start position:0%
socialize if your brain is drawing a
 

00:01:44.000 --> 00:01:46.230 align:start position:0%
socialize if your brain is drawing a
blank<00:01:44.799><c> so</c><00:01:44.960><c> let's</c><00:01:45.200><c> start</c><00:01:45.360><c> by</c><00:01:45.600><c> understanding</c>

00:01:46.230 --> 00:01:46.240 align:start position:0%
blank so let's start by understanding
 

00:01:46.240 --> 00:01:47.670 align:start position:0%
blank so let's start by understanding
how<00:01:46.479><c> does</c><00:01:46.640><c> your</c><00:01:46.799><c> brain</c><00:01:47.040><c> draw</c><00:01:47.280><c> blank</c><00:01:47.520><c> where</c>

00:01:47.670 --> 00:01:47.680 align:start position:0%
how does your brain draw blank where
 

00:01:47.680 --> 00:01:49.109 align:start position:0%
how does your brain draw blank where
does<00:01:47.840><c> that</c><00:01:48.000><c> blank</c><00:01:48.240><c> come</c><00:01:48.479><c> from</c><00:01:48.720><c> why</c><00:01:48.960><c> is</c><00:01:49.040><c> it</c>

00:01:49.109 --> 00:01:49.119 align:start position:0%
does that blank come from why is it
 

00:01:49.119 --> 00:01:51.670 align:start position:0%
does that blank come from why is it
coming<00:01:49.439><c> up</c><00:01:49.600><c> link</c><00:01:50.240><c> and</c><00:01:50.399><c> if</c><00:01:50.479><c> we</c><00:01:50.640><c> can</c><00:01:50.799><c> understand</c>

00:01:51.670 --> 00:01:51.680 align:start position:0%
coming up link and if we can understand
 

00:01:51.680 --> 00:01:53.590 align:start position:0%
coming up link and if we can understand
how<00:01:51.920><c> it</c><00:01:52.079><c> draws</c><00:01:52.320><c> a</c><00:01:52.399><c> blank</c><00:01:53.119><c> and</c><00:01:53.200><c> then</c><00:01:53.360><c> we</c><00:01:53.520><c> can</c>

00:01:53.590 --> 00:01:53.600 align:start position:0%
how it draws a blank and then we can
 

00:01:53.600 --> 00:01:55.590 align:start position:0%
how it draws a blank and then we can
understand<00:01:54.159><c> how</c><00:01:54.320><c> to</c><00:01:54.560><c> change</c><00:01:54.880><c> that</c><00:01:55.119><c> so</c><00:01:55.280><c> it</c><00:01:55.360><c> no</c>

00:01:55.590 --> 00:01:55.600 align:start position:0%
understand how to change that so it no
 

00:01:55.600 --> 00:01:57.749 align:start position:0%
understand how to change that so it no
longer<00:01:55.920><c> comes</c><00:01:56.159><c> up</c><00:01:56.320><c> blank</c><00:01:56.960><c> then</c><00:01:57.200><c> the</c><00:01:57.360><c> process</c>

00:01:57.749 --> 00:01:57.759 align:start position:0%
longer comes up blank then the process
 

00:01:57.759 --> 00:01:59.749 align:start position:0%
longer comes up blank then the process
should<00:01:58.000><c> be</c><00:01:58.079><c> a</c><00:01:58.159><c> lot</c><00:01:58.479><c> easier</c><00:01:58.960><c> for</c><00:01:59.119><c> you</c><00:01:59.520><c> and</c><00:01:59.680><c> you</c>

00:01:59.749 --> 00:01:59.759 align:start position:0%
should be a lot easier for you and you
 

00:01:59.759 --> 00:02:01.749 align:start position:0%
should be a lot easier for you and you
won't<00:02:00.000><c> have</c><00:02:00.079><c> to</c><00:02:00.240><c> force</c><00:02:00.560><c> yourself</c><00:02:00.880><c> into</c><00:02:01.119><c> stuff</c>

00:02:01.749 --> 00:02:01.759 align:start position:0%
won't have to force yourself into stuff
 

00:02:01.759 --> 00:02:03.270 align:start position:0%
won't have to force yourself into stuff
okay

00:02:03.270 --> 00:02:03.280 align:start position:0%
okay
 

00:02:03.280 --> 00:02:05.590 align:start position:0%
okay
so<00:02:03.439><c> let's</c><00:02:03.680><c> start</c><00:02:03.920><c> by</c><00:02:04.159><c> understanding</c><00:02:05.280><c> a</c><00:02:05.439><c> little</c>

00:02:05.590 --> 00:02:05.600 align:start position:0%
so let's start by understanding a little
 

00:02:05.600 --> 00:02:08.790 align:start position:0%
so let's start by understanding a little
bit<00:02:05.759><c> about</c><00:02:06.079><c> how</c><00:02:06.320><c> brains</c><00:02:06.719><c> draw</c><00:02:06.960><c> blinks</c>

00:02:08.790 --> 00:02:08.800 align:start position:0%
bit about how brains draw blinks
 

00:02:08.800 --> 00:02:10.869 align:start position:0%
bit about how brains draw blinks
so

00:02:10.869 --> 00:02:10.879 align:start position:0%
so
 

00:02:10.879 --> 00:02:12.949 align:start position:0%
so
when<00:02:11.120><c> i</c><00:02:11.200><c> set</c><00:02:11.440><c> a</c><00:02:11.520><c> task</c>

00:02:12.949 --> 00:02:12.959 align:start position:0%
when i set a task
 

00:02:12.959 --> 00:02:15.270 align:start position:0%
when i set a task
my<00:02:13.200><c> brain</c><00:02:13.599><c> tends</c><00:02:13.920><c> to</c><00:02:14.080><c> come</c><00:02:14.400><c> up</c><00:02:14.640><c> with</c><00:02:14.959><c> how</c><00:02:15.200><c> to</c>

00:02:15.270 --> 00:02:15.280 align:start position:0%
my brain tends to come up with how to
 

00:02:15.280 --> 00:02:17.430 align:start position:0%
my brain tends to come up with how to
accomplish<00:02:15.840><c> it</c><00:02:16.080><c> right</c><00:02:16.239><c> so</c><00:02:16.400><c> if</c><00:02:16.560><c> i</c><00:02:16.720><c> say</c>

00:02:17.430 --> 00:02:17.440 align:start position:0%
accomplish it right so if i say
 

00:02:17.440 --> 00:02:19.430 align:start position:0%
accomplish it right so if i say
man<00:02:17.920><c> i'm</c><00:02:18.080><c> really</c><00:02:18.400><c> thirsty</c><00:02:18.800><c> i</c><00:02:18.959><c> don't</c><00:02:19.200><c> need</c><00:02:19.360><c> to</c>

00:02:19.430 --> 00:02:19.440 align:start position:0%
man i'm really thirsty i don't need to
 

00:02:19.440 --> 00:02:21.030 align:start position:0%
man i'm really thirsty i don't need to
say<00:02:19.599><c> that</c><00:02:19.840><c> i</c><00:02:19.920><c> think</c><00:02:20.239><c> i'm</c><00:02:20.400><c> really</c><00:02:20.640><c> thirsty</c><00:02:20.959><c> and</c>

00:02:21.030 --> 00:02:21.040 align:start position:0%
say that i think i'm really thirsty and
 

00:02:21.040 --> 00:02:22.630 align:start position:0%
say that i think i'm really thirsty and
then<00:02:21.200><c> my</c><00:02:21.360><c> brain</c><00:02:21.680><c> is</c><00:02:21.760><c> like</c><00:02:21.920><c> oh</c><00:02:22.080><c> there's</c><00:02:22.319><c> a</c><00:02:22.400><c> water</c>

00:02:22.630 --> 00:02:22.640 align:start position:0%
then my brain is like oh there's a water
 

00:02:22.640 --> 00:02:26.869 align:start position:0%
then my brain is like oh there's a water
cup<00:02:22.879><c> here</c>

00:02:26.869 --> 00:02:26.879 align:start position:0%
 
 

00:02:26.879 --> 00:02:29.190 align:start position:0%
 
problem<00:02:27.360><c> solved</c><00:02:27.760><c> right</c><00:02:28.400><c> so</c><00:02:28.560><c> our</c><00:02:28.720><c> brain</c><00:02:29.040><c> when</c>

00:02:29.190 --> 00:02:29.200 align:start position:0%
problem solved right so our brain when
 

00:02:29.200 --> 00:02:31.270 align:start position:0%
problem solved right so our brain when
we<00:02:29.360><c> set</c><00:02:29.520><c> a</c><00:02:29.680><c> task</c>

00:02:31.270 --> 00:02:31.280 align:start position:0%
we set a task
 

00:02:31.280 --> 00:02:34.550 align:start position:0%
we set a task
our<00:02:31.440><c> brain</c><00:02:31.760><c> will</c><00:02:32.280><c> operationalize</c><00:02:33.360><c> that</c><00:02:33.599><c> task</c>

00:02:34.550 --> 00:02:34.560 align:start position:0%
our brain will operationalize that task
 

00:02:34.560 --> 00:02:37.030 align:start position:0%
our brain will operationalize that task
so<00:02:34.720><c> the</c><00:02:34.800><c> term</c><00:02:35.200><c> opera</c><00:02:35.920><c> opera</c>

00:02:37.030 --> 00:02:37.040 align:start position:0%
so the term opera opera
 

00:02:37.040 --> 00:02:39.630 align:start position:0%
so the term opera opera
operate

00:02:39.630 --> 00:02:39.640 align:start position:0%
 
 

00:02:39.640 --> 00:02:41.430 align:start position:0%
 
operationalizing

00:02:41.430 --> 00:02:41.440 align:start position:0%
operationalizing
 

00:02:41.440 --> 00:02:45.589 align:start position:0%
operationalizing
is<00:02:41.599><c> the</c><00:02:41.840><c> process</c><00:02:42.640><c> of</c><00:02:42.959><c> breaking</c><00:02:43.519><c> apart</c>

00:02:45.589 --> 00:02:45.599 align:start position:0%
is the process of breaking apart
 

00:02:45.599 --> 00:02:48.309 align:start position:0%
is the process of breaking apart
one<00:02:46.080><c> large</c><00:02:46.640><c> task</c><00:02:47.200><c> into</c><00:02:47.519><c> its</c><00:02:47.760><c> individual</c>

00:02:48.309 --> 00:02:48.319 align:start position:0%
one large task into its individual
 

00:02:48.319 --> 00:02:51.110 align:start position:0%
one large task into its individual
components<00:02:48.879><c> it's</c><00:02:49.040><c> the</c><00:02:49.360><c> execution</c><00:02:50.239><c> component</c>

00:02:51.110 --> 00:02:51.120 align:start position:0%
components it's the execution component
 

00:02:51.120 --> 00:02:54.869 align:start position:0%
components it's the execution component
okay

00:02:54.869 --> 00:02:54.879 align:start position:0%
 
 

00:02:54.879 --> 00:02:56.869 align:start position:0%
 
so

00:02:56.869 --> 00:02:56.879 align:start position:0%
so
