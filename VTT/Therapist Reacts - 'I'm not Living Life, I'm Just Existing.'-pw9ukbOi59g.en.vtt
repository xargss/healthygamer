00:04:31.749 --> 00:04:31.759 align:start position:0%
motivation you fall into this cycle like
 

00:04:31.759 --> 00:04:33.590 align:start position:0%
motivation you fall into this cycle like
i'm<00:04:32.000><c> not</c><00:04:32.160><c> motivated</c><00:04:32.720><c> i</c><00:04:32.880><c> fell</c><00:04:33.120><c> behind</c>

00:04:33.590 --> 00:04:33.600 align:start position:0%
i'm not motivated i fell behind
 

00:04:33.600 --> 00:04:35.510 align:start position:0%
i'm not motivated i fell behind
therefore<00:04:34.000><c> i'm</c><00:04:34.160><c> an</c><00:04:34.320><c> idiot</c><00:04:34.880><c> the</c><00:04:35.120><c> more</c><00:04:35.360><c> that</c>

00:04:35.510 --> 00:04:35.520 align:start position:0%
therefore i'm an idiot the more that
 

00:04:35.520 --> 00:04:38.310 align:start position:0%
therefore i'm an idiot the more that
your<00:04:35.680><c> brain</c><00:04:35.919><c> thinks</c><00:04:36.160><c> that</c><00:04:36.479><c> you're</c><00:04:36.720><c> an</c><00:04:36.880><c> idiot</c>

00:04:38.310 --> 00:04:38.320 align:start position:0%
your brain thinks that you're an idiot

00:04:40.230 --> 00:04:40.240 align:start position:0%
the more its calculation about
 

00:04:40.240 --> 00:04:42.150 align:start position:0%
the more its calculation about
motivation<00:04:40.800><c> is</c><00:04:40.960><c> going</c><00:04:41.040><c> to</c><00:04:41.120><c> go</c><00:04:41.360><c> downhill</c>

00:04:42.150 --> 00:04:42.160 align:start position:0%
motivation is going to go downhill
 

00:04:42.160 --> 00:04:43.749 align:start position:0%
motivation is going to go downhill
because<00:04:42.479><c> your</c><00:04:42.639><c> brain</c><00:04:42.880><c> is</c><00:04:43.040><c> smart</c><00:04:43.360><c> right</c><00:04:43.520><c> so</c><00:04:43.680><c> it</c>
