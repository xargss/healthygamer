someone
and<00:07:28.720><c> then</c><00:07:28.880><c> i</c><00:07:29.120><c> think</c><00:07:29.520><c> through</c><00:07:29.759><c> it</c><00:07:30.160><c> and</c><00:07:30.240><c> then</c><00:07:30.479><c> i</c>

00:07:30.629 --> 00:07:30.639 align:start position:0%
and then i think through it and then i
 

00:07:30.639 --> 00:07:32.710 align:start position:0%
and then i think through it and then i
realize<00:07:31.120><c> i</c><00:07:31.199><c> might</c><00:07:31.440><c> not</c>
