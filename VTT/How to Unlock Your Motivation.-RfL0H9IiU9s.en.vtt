and none of that stuff really tends to
 

00:00:55.680 --> 00:00:57.430 align:start position:0%
and none of that stuff really tends to

move towards that goal
 

00:02:07.759 --> 00:02:09.910 align:start position:0%
move towards that goal

00:02:14.949 --> 00:02:14.959 align:start position:0%
sort of pulls us in that direction the
 

00:02:14.959 --> 00:02:17.270 align:start position:0%
sort of pulls us in that direction the

00:08:09.510 --> 00:08:09.520 align:start position:0%
question is
 

00:08:09.520 --> 00:08:11.990 align:start position:0%

00:08:13.350 --> 00:08:13.360 align:start position:0%
principle play it all
 

00:08:13.360 --> 00:08:15.589 align:start position:0%
principle play it all
into<00:08:13.680><c> becoming</c><00:08:14.160><c> sober</c><00:08:14.879><c> and</c><00:08:14.960><c> the</c><00:08:15.120><c> answer</c><00:08:15.440><c> is</c>

00:08:15.589 --> 00:08:15.599 align:start position:0%
into becoming sober and the answer is
 

00:08:15.599 --> 00:08:16.790 align:start position:0%
