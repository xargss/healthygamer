00:02:51.110 --> 00:02:51.120 align:start position:0%
to give up i'm kind of confused about
 

00:02:51.120 --> 00:02:52.309 align:start position:0%
to give up i'm kind of confused about
what<00:02:51.280><c> i</c><00:02:51.360><c> want</c><00:02:51.519><c> to</c><00:02:51.599><c> do</c>

what i want to do
 

00:02:52.319 --> 00:02:54.070 align:start position:0%
what i want to do
so<00:02:52.480><c> i</c><00:02:52.560><c> guess</c><00:02:52.720><c> this</c><00:02:52.959><c> is</c><00:02:53.040><c> a</c><00:02:53.120><c> common</c><00:02:53.519><c> question</c><00:02:53.920><c> of</c>

00:02:54.070 --> 00:02:54.080 align:start position:0%
so i guess this is a common question of
 

00:02:54.080 --> 00:02:56.070 align:start position:0%
so i guess this is a common question of
like<00:02:54.800><c> you</c><00:02:54.959><c> know</c><00:02:55.120><c> sometimes</c><00:02:55.599><c> like</c><00:02:55.760><c> we'll</c><00:02:55.920><c> do</c>

00:02:56.070 --> 00:02:56.080 align:start position:0%

00:03:08.560 --> 00:03:09.910 align:start position:0%
and so what's going on there sometimes
we<00:03:08.640><c> feel</c><00:03:08.800><c> like</c><00:03:08.959><c> dropping</c><00:03:09.280><c> out</c><00:03:09.440><c> of</c><00:03:09.519><c> graduate</c>

it's<00:03:12.879><c> a</c><00:03:12.959><c> great</c><00:03:13.200><c> question</c><00:03:13.519><c> so</c><00:03:13.599><c> let's</c><00:03:13.840><c> kind</c><00:03:13.920><c> of</c>

00:03:14.070 --> 00:03:14.080 align:start position:0%
it's a great question so let's kind of
 

00:03:14.080 --> 00:03:16.149 align:start position:0%
it's a great question so let's kind of
unpack<00:03:14.480><c> things</c><00:03:14.720><c> one</c><00:03:14.879><c> step</c><00:03:15.120><c> at</c><00:03:15.280><c> a</c><00:03:15.360><c> time</c>

00:03:16.149 --> 00:03:16.159 align:start position:0%
unpack things one step at a time
 

00:03:16.159 --> 00:03:18.229 align:start position:0%
unpack things one step at a time
so<00:03:16.400><c> the</c><00:03:16.480><c> first</c><00:03:16.720><c> thing</c><00:03:17.120><c> is</c><00:03:17.360><c> that</c><00:03:17.920><c> there</c><00:03:18.080><c> are</c><00:03:18.159><c> a</c>

00:03:18.229 --> 00:03:18.239 align:start position:0%
so the first thing is that there are a
 

00:03:18.239 --> 00:03:19.589 align:start position:0%
so the first thing is that there are a
couple<00:03:18.640><c> of</c>

00:03:19.589 --> 00:03:19.599 align:start position:0%
couple of
 

00:03:19.599 --> 00:03:21.110 align:start position:0%
couple of
a<00:03:19.680><c> couple</c><00:03:19.920><c> of</c><00:03:20.000><c> ways</c><00:03:20.239><c> to</c><00:03:20.319><c> look</c><00:03:20.480><c> at</c><00:03:20.560><c> it</c><00:03:20.720><c> the</c><00:03:20.800><c> first</c>

00:03:21.110 --> 00:03:21.120 align:start position:0%
a couple of ways to look at it the first
 

00:03:21.120 --> 00:03:22.630 align:start position:0%
a couple of ways to look at it the first
is<00:03:21.280><c> that</c><00:03:21.519><c> you</c><00:03:21.599><c> know</c><00:03:21.840><c> what</c><00:03:22.080><c> is</c><00:03:22.239><c> it</c><00:03:22.319><c> that</c><00:03:22.480><c> you</c>

00:03:22.630 --> 00:03:22.640 align:start position:0%
is that you know what is it that you
 

00:03:22.640 --> 00:03:23.670 align:start position:0%
is that you know what is it that you
dislike

00:03:23.670 --> 00:03:23.680 align:start position:0%
dislike
 

00:03:23.680 --> 00:03:25.990 align:start position:0%
dislike
so<00:03:24.000><c> mba</c><00:03:24.480><c> is</c><00:03:24.640><c> masters</c><00:03:25.120><c> in</c><00:03:25.200><c> business</c><00:03:25.599><c> business</c>

00:03:25.990 --> 00:03:26.000 align:start position:0%
so mba is masters in business business
 

00:03:26.000 --> 00:03:27.830 align:start position:0%
so mba is masters in business business
administration

00:03:27.830 --> 00:03:27.840 align:start position:0%
administration
 

00:03:27.840 --> 00:03:30.949 align:start position:0%
administration
um<00:03:28.879><c> so</c>

00:03:30.949 --> 00:03:30.959 align:start position:0%
um so
 

00:03:30.959 --> 00:03:34.470 align:start position:0%
um so
the<00:03:31.120><c> first</c><00:03:31.360><c> question</c><00:03:31.680><c> is</c><00:03:31.760><c> like</c><00:03:32.319><c> you</c><00:03:32.400><c> know</c>

00:03:34.470 --> 00:03:34.480 align:start position:0%
the first question is like you know
 

00:03:34.480 --> 00:03:36.149 align:start position:0%
the first question is like you know
but<00:03:34.640><c> i</c><00:03:34.799><c> believe</c><00:03:35.120><c> that</c><00:03:35.360><c> recently</c><00:03:35.840><c> i've</c><00:03:36.000><c> been</c>
