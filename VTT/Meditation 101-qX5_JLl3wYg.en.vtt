00:07:26.770 --> 00:07:26.780 align:start position:0%
gets blocked too with like [ __ ] and then
 

00:07:26.780 --> 00:07:28.630 align:start position:0%
gets blocked too with like [ __ ] and then
people<00:07:27.110><c> have</c><00:07:27.290><c> strokes</c><00:07:27.650><c> because</c><00:07:27.980><c> it's</c><00:07:28.310><c> blocked</c>

and that's the main artery that feeds
you<00:07:30.800><c> know</c><00:07:30.920><c> the</c><00:07:31.010><c> front</c><00:07:31.310><c> side</c><00:07:32.060><c> of</c><00:07:32.240><c> your</c><00:07:32.360><c> brain</c>

00:07:32.940 --> 00:07:32.950 align:start position:0%
you know the front side of your brain
 

00:07:32.950 --> 00:07:35.020 align:start position:0%
you know the front side of your brain
and<00:07:33.950><c> so</c><00:07:34.040><c> what</c><00:07:34.160><c> you</c><00:07:34.250><c> do</c><00:07:34.400><c> is</c><00:07:34.520><c> you</c><00:07:34.610><c> go</c><00:07:34.760><c> in</c><00:07:34.880><c> with</c>

and so what you do is you go in with
 

00:07:35.030 --> 00:07:39.100 align:start position:0%
and so what you do is you go in with
surgery<00:07:35.450><c> and</c><00:07:35.540><c> you</c><00:07:35.660><c> pull</c><00:07:35.900><c> the</c><00:07:36.050><c> gunk</c><00:07:36.320><c> out</c><00:07:37.120><c> so</c><00:07:38.120><c> not</c>

00:07:39.100 --> 00:07:39.110 align:start position:0%

00:07:40.600 --> 00:07:40.610 align:start position:0%
[ __ ] yeah I mean it gets filled with
 

00:07:40.610 --> 00:07:42.040 align:start position:0%
[ __ ] yeah I mean it gets filled with
like<00:07:40.790><c> cholesterol</c><00:07:41.060><c> and</c><00:07:41.480><c> stuff</c><00:07:41.660><c> like</c><00:07:41.780><c> the</c><00:07:41.900><c> same</c>

00:07:42.040 --> 00:07:42.050 align:start position:0%
like cholesterol and stuff like the same
 

00:07:42.050 --> 00:07:43.270 align:start position:0%
like cholesterol and stuff like the same
stuff<00:07:42.260><c> that</c><00:07:42.380><c> hardens</c><00:07:42.680><c> the</c><00:07:42.770><c> arteries</c><00:07:42.980><c> of</c><00:07:43.160><c> your</c>

00:07:43.270 --> 00:07:43.280 align:start position:0%
stuff that hardens the arteries of your
 

00:07:43.280 --> 00:07:46.090 align:start position:0%
stuff that hardens the arteries of your
heart<00:07:43.990><c> and</c><00:07:44.990><c> gets</c><00:07:45.200><c> inflamed</c><00:07:45.650><c> and</c><00:07:45.860><c> things</c><00:07:45.980><c> like</c>

00:07:46.090 --> 00:07:46.100 align:start position:0%
heart and gets inflamed and things like
 

00:07:46.100 --> 00:07:52.060 align:start position:0%
heart and gets inflamed and things like
that<00:07:46.160><c> so</c><00:07:49.870><c> so</c><00:07:50.870><c> I</c><00:07:50.900><c> was</c><00:07:51.080><c> in</c><00:07:51.200><c> this</c><00:07:51.320><c> surgery</c><00:07:51.830><c> right</c>

00:07:52.060 --> 00:07:52.070 align:start position:0%
that so so I was in this surgery right
 

00:07:52.070 --> 00:07:55.570 align:start position:0%
that so so I was in this surgery right
and<00:07:53.650><c> surgeons</c><00:07:54.650><c> are</c><00:07:54.800><c> not</c><00:07:54.920><c> the</c><00:07:55.070><c> nicest</c><00:07:55.190><c> people</c>

00:07:55.570 --> 00:07:55.580 align:start position:0%
and surgeons are not the nicest people
 

00:07:55.580 --> 00:07:58.060 align:start position:0%
and surgeons are not the nicest people
and<00:07:55.970><c> so</c><00:07:56.570><c> this</c><00:07:56.720><c> guy</c><00:07:56.990><c> is</c><00:07:57.050><c> doing</c><00:07:57.290><c> the</c><00:07:57.500><c> surgery</c><00:07:57.650><c> and</c>

00:07:58.060 --> 00:07:58.070 align:start position:0%
and so this guy is doing the surgery and
 

00:07:58.070 --> 00:08:00.190 align:start position:0%
and so this guy is doing the surgery and
then<00:07:58.640><c> he</c><00:07:58.850><c> like</c><00:07:59.060><c> cut</c><00:07:59.360><c> something</c><00:07:59.810><c> that</c><00:07:59.930><c> he's</c><00:08:00.050><c> not</c>

00:08:00.190 --> 00:08:00.200 align:start position:0%
then he like cut something that he's not
 

00:08:00.200 --> 00:08:02.740 align:start position:0%
then he like cut something that he's not
supposed<00:08:00.380><c> to</c><00:08:00.680><c> cut</c><00:08:00.920><c> and</c><00:08:01.730><c> the</c><00:08:02.180><c> [ __ ]</c><00:08:02.390><c> starts</c>

00:08:02.740 --> 00:08:02.750 align:start position:0%
supposed to cut and the [ __ ] starts
 

00:08:02.750 --> 00:08:04.810 align:start position:0%
supposed to cut and the [ __ ] starts
bleeding<00:08:03.050><c> and</c><00:08:03.440><c> like</c><00:08:03.920><c> the</c><00:08:04.040><c> field</c><00:08:04.310><c> of</c><00:08:04.550><c> vision</c>

00:08:04.810 --> 00:08:04.820 align:start position:0%
bleeding and like the field of vision
 

00:08:04.820 --> 00:08:08.350 align:start position:0%

for<00:08:05.240><c> a</c><00:08:05.410><c> neck</c><00:08:06.410><c> surgery</c><00:08:06.860><c> is</c><00:08:06.980><c> like</c><00:08:07.130><c> tiny</c><00:08:07.520><c> it's</c>

00:08:08.350 --> 00:08:08.360 align:start position:0%
for a neck surgery is like tiny it's
 

00:08:08.360 --> 00:08:09.670 align:start position:0%
for a neck surgery is like tiny it's

00:08:16.270 --> 00:08:16.280 align:start position:0%
that's open it's very small so it
 

00:08:16.280 --> 00:08:17.860 align:start position:0%
that's open it's very small so it
doesn't<00:08:16.610><c> take</c><00:08:16.730><c> a</c><00:08:16.760><c> whole</c><00:08:16.880><c> lot</c><00:08:17.210><c> of</c><00:08:17.240><c> blood</c><00:08:17.570><c> to</c>

the blood like he's looking for like
 

00:08:30.139 --> 00:08:31.779 align:start position:0%

00:08:31.779 --> 00:08:31.789 align:start position:0%
what he caught in what's bleeding and he
 

00:08:31.789 --> 00:08:34.300 align:start position:0%
what he caught in what's bleeding and he
