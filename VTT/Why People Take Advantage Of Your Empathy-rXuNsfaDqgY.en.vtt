gonna make a couple of assumptions here
 

00:10:56.000 --> 00:10:57.430 align:start position:0%
gonna make a couple of assumptions here
the<00:10:56.160><c> first</c><00:10:56.399><c> is</c><00:10:56.560><c> that</c><00:10:56.720><c> i'm</c><00:10:56.880><c> going</c><00:10:57.040><c> to</c><00:10:57.120><c> assume</c>

00:10:57.430 --> 00:10:57.440 align:start position:0%
the first is that i'm going to assume
 

00:10:57.440 --> 00:10:59.509 align:start position:0%
the first is that i'm going to assume
that<00:10:57.600><c> you</c><00:10:57.680><c> can't</c><00:10:58.000><c> escape</c><00:10:58.320><c> this</c><00:10:58.560><c> person</c>

that you can't escape this person
the<00:10:59.680><c> second</c><00:11:00.320><c> assumption</c><00:11:00.800><c> i'm</c><00:11:00.880><c> going</c><00:11:00.959><c> to</c><00:11:01.040><c> make</c>

00:11:01.350 --> 00:11:01.360 align:start position:0%
the second assumption i'm going to make
 

00:11:01.360 --> 00:11:04.550 align:start position:0%
the second assumption i'm going to make
is<00:11:01.519><c> that</c><00:11:01.680><c> this</c><00:11:01.839><c> person</c><00:11:02.399><c> actually</c>

00:11:04.550 --> 00:11:04.560 align:start position:0%
