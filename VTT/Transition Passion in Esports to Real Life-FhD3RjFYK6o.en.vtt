00:16:06.950 --> 00:16:06.960 align:start position:0%
use the word bored yeah so I think what
 

00:16:06.960 --> 00:16:09.290 align:start position:0%
use the word bored yeah so I think what
what<00:16:07.380><c> motivates</c><00:16:08.010><c> you</c><00:16:08.280><c> is</c><00:16:08.490><c> like</c><00:16:08.700><c> learning</c><00:16:08.970><c> a</c>

00:16:09.290 --> 00:16:09.300 align:start position:0%
what motivates you is like learning a
 

00:16:09.300 --> 00:16:11.660 align:start position:0%
what motivates you is like learning a
new<00:16:09.480><c> problem</c><00:16:09.990><c> right</c><00:16:10.650><c> it's</c><00:16:10.890><c> like</c><00:16:11.100><c> something</c>

00:16:11.660 --> 00:16:11.670 align:start position:0%
new problem right it's like something
 

00:16:11.670 --> 00:16:13.490 align:start position:0%
new problem right it's like something
that's<00:16:11.820><c> new</c><00:16:12.030><c> and</c><00:16:12.060><c> exciting</c><00:16:12.630><c> and</c><00:16:12.750><c> so</c><00:16:13.350><c> I</c><00:16:13.380><c> think</c>

00:16:13.490 --> 00:16:13.500 align:start position:0%
that's new and exciting and so I think
 

00:16:13.500 --> 00:16:15.050 align:start position:0%
that's new and exciting and so I think
the<00:16:13.680><c> problem</c><00:16:13.920><c> is</c><00:16:14.220><c> that</c><00:16:14.370><c> you</c><00:16:14.460><c> give</c><00:16:14.700><c> up</c><00:16:14.850><c> when</c><00:16:15.000><c> the</c>

00:16:15.050 --> 00:16:15.060 align:start position:0%
the problem is that you give up when the
 

00:16:15.060 --> 00:16:17.320 align:start position:0%
the problem is that you give up when the
end<00:16:15.300><c> is</c><00:16:15.570><c> in</c><00:16:15.720><c> sight</c><00:16:15.930><c> like</c><00:16:15.990><c> it's</c><00:16:16.380><c> sort</c><00:16:16.530><c> of</c><00:16:16.620><c> like</c>

00:16:17.320 --> 00:16:17.330 align:start position:0%
end is in sight like it's sort of like
 

00:16:17.330 --> 00:16:19.730 align:start position:0%
end is in sight like it's sort of like
and<00:16:18.330><c> that's</c><00:16:18.540><c> not</c><00:16:18.690><c> because</c><00:16:18.900><c> and</c><00:16:19.380><c> that's</c><00:16:19.560><c> just</c>

00:16:19.730 --> 00:16:19.740 align:start position:0%
and that's not because and that's just
