00:14:28.800 --> 00:14:28.810 align:start position:0%
was talking about oxytocin so we're just
 

00:14:28.810 --> 00:14:30.330 align:start position:0%
was talking about oxytocin so we're just
gonna<00:14:28.990><c> talk</c><00:14:29.290><c> for</c><00:14:29.620><c> a</c><00:14:29.680><c> second</c><00:14:29.950><c> about</c><00:14:29.980><c> oxytocin</c>

00:14:30.330 --> 00:14:30.340 align:start position:0%
gonna talk for a second about oxytocin
 

00:14:30.340 --> 00:14:34.200 align:start position:0%
gonna talk for a second about oxytocin
then<00:14:30.820><c> we'll</c><00:14:31.000><c> we'll</c><00:14:31.360><c> move</c><00:14:31.930><c> on</c><00:14:32.880><c> so</c><00:14:33.880><c> you</c><00:14:33.940><c> have</c><00:14:34.180><c> a</c>

00:14:34.200 --> 00:14:34.210 align:start position:0%
then we'll we'll move on so you have a
 

00:14:34.210 --> 00:14:35.730 align:start position:0%
then we'll we'll move on so you have a
neurotransmitter<00:14:34.570><c> or</c><00:14:35.200><c> hormone</c><00:14:35.530><c> called</c>

00:14:35.730 --> 00:14:35.740 align:start position:0%
neurotransmitter or hormone called
 

00:14:35.740 --> 00:14:39.930 align:start position:0%
neurotransmitter or hormone called
oxytocin<00:14:37.110><c> which</c><00:14:38.110><c> forms</c><00:14:39.010><c> like</c><00:14:39.250><c> emotional</c>

00:14:39.930 --> 00:14:39.940 align:start position:0%
oxytocin which forms like emotional
 

00:14:39.940 --> 00:14:42.780 align:start position:0%
oxytocin which forms like emotional
bonds<00:14:40.330><c> so</c><00:14:41.190><c> oxytocin</c><00:14:42.190><c> is</c><00:14:42.280><c> the</c><00:14:42.310><c> hormone</c><00:14:42.430><c> that</c>

00:14:42.780 --> 00:14:42.790 align:start position:0%
bonds so oxytocin is the hormone that
 

00:14:42.790 --> 00:14:48.720 align:start position:0%
bonds so oxytocin is the hormone that
causes<00:14:44.580><c> mothers</c><00:14:45.870><c> to</c><00:14:46.870><c> release</c><00:14:47.320><c> breast</c><00:14:47.710><c> milk</c><00:14:47.980><c> so</c>

00:14:48.720 --> 00:14:48.730 align:start position:0%
causes mothers to release breast milk so
 

00:14:48.730 --> 00:14:50.400 align:start position:0%
causes mothers to release breast milk so
you<00:14:48.760><c> have</c><00:14:49.240><c> some</c><00:14:49.540><c> hormones</c><00:14:49.750><c> that</c><00:14:50.020><c> cause</c><00:14:50.200><c> the</c>

00:14:50.400 --> 00:14:50.410 align:start position:0%
you have some hormones that cause the
