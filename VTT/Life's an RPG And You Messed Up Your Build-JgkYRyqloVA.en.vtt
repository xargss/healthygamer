00:00:47.600 --> 00:00:49.510 align:start position:0%
you know missed milestones and then
people<00:00:47.840><c> basically</c><00:00:48.399><c> feel</c><00:00:48.640><c> like</c>

00:00:52.389 --> 00:00:52.399 align:start position:0%
like you can't kind of go and get it
 

00:00:52.399 --> 00:00:54.869 align:start position:0%
like you can't kind of go and get it
back<00:00:53.120><c> so</c><00:00:53.280><c> this</c><00:00:53.520><c> kind</c><00:00:53.680><c> of</c><00:00:53.760><c> concept</c><00:00:54.320><c> entered</c><00:00:54.719><c> our</c>

00:01:24.710 --> 00:01:24.720 align:start position:0%
a door is forever close to them
 

00:01:24.720 --> 00:01:26.469 align:start position:0%
a door is forever close to them

00:01:26.469 --> 00:01:26.479 align:start position:0%
and so the main question is like is that
 

00:01:26.479 --> 00:01:28.390 align:start position:0%
and so the main question is like is that

generally speaking how life works like
 

00:01:28.400 --> 00:01:30.870 align:start position:0%
generally speaking how life works like

00:01:30.870 --> 00:01:30.880 align:start position:0%
what are the what is the rpg system
 

00:01:30.880 --> 00:01:33.990 align:start position:0%
what are the what is the rpg system
that<00:01:31.200><c> best</c><00:01:31.680><c> mirrors</c><00:01:32.240><c> like</c><00:01:32.479><c> how</c><00:01:32.720><c> you</c><00:01:32.960><c> gain</c>

00:01:33.990 --> 00:01:34.000 align:start position:0%
that best mirrors like how you gain
 

00:01:34.000 --> 00:01:36.069 align:start position:0%
that best mirrors like how you gain
like<00:01:34.400><c> stats</c><00:01:34.880><c> and</c><00:01:35.040><c> level</c><00:01:35.360><c> up</c><00:01:35.520><c> in</c><00:01:35.680><c> life</c><00:01:35.920><c> like</c>

00:01:36.069 --> 00:01:36.079 align:start position:0%
like stats and level up in life like
 

00:01:36.079 --> 00:01:38.230 align:start position:0%
like stats and level up in life like
what<00:01:36.240><c> does</c><00:01:36.400><c> it</c><00:01:36.560><c> actually</c><00:01:36.880><c> work</c><00:01:37.200><c> like</c>

00:01:38.230 --> 00:01:38.240 align:start position:0%
what does it actually work like
 

00:01:38.240 --> 00:01:39.030 align:start position:0%
what does it actually work like
so

00:01:39.030 --> 00:01:39.040 align:start position:0%
so
 

00:01:39.040 --> 00:01:41.510 align:start position:0%
so
i'd<00:01:39.280><c> say</c><00:01:39.439><c> that</c><00:01:39.680><c> in</c><00:01:39.840><c> general</c><00:01:40.320><c> life</c><00:01:40.880><c> is</c><00:01:41.119><c> sort</c><00:01:41.360><c> of</c>

00:01:41.510 --> 00:01:41.520 align:start position:0%
i'd say that in general life is sort of
 

00:01:41.520 --> 00:01:43.190 align:start position:0%
i'd say that in general life is sort of
like<00:01:41.759><c> closest</c><00:01:42.399><c> to</c>

00:01:43.190 --> 00:01:43.200 align:start position:0%

00:01:46.310 --> 00:01:46.320 align:start position:0%
there may be a better example of this
 

00:01:46.320 --> 00:01:48.230 align:start position:0%
there may be a better example of this
but<00:01:46.560><c> like</c><00:01:46.960><c> one</c><00:01:47.119><c> of</c><00:01:47.200><c> these</c><00:01:47.439><c> elder</c><00:01:47.840><c> scrolls</c>

00:01:48.230 --> 00:01:48.240 align:start position:0%
but like one of these elder scrolls
 

00:01:48.240 --> 00:01:50.069 align:start position:0%

games<00:01:48.560><c> where</c><00:01:48.799><c> basically</c><00:01:49.200><c> the</c><00:01:49.360><c> more</c><00:01:49.680><c> you</c><00:01:49.840><c> do</c>

00:01:50.069 --> 00:01:50.079 align:start position:0%
games where basically the more you do
 

00:01:50.079 --> 00:01:52.870 align:start position:0%
games where basically the more you do
something<00:01:50.880><c> the</c><00:01:51.040><c> more</c><00:01:51.280><c> you</c><00:01:51.520><c> level</c><00:01:51.840><c> up</c><00:01:52.000><c> in</c><00:01:52.159><c> it</c><00:01:52.720><c> so</c>

00:01:52.870 --> 00:01:52.880 align:start position:0%
something the more you level up in it so
 

00:01:52.880 --> 00:01:54.389 align:start position:0%
something the more you level up in it so
the<00:01:52.960><c> first</c><00:01:53.200><c> thing</c><00:01:53.360><c> is</c><00:01:53.520><c> like</c><00:01:53.680><c> this</c><00:01:53.840><c> concept</c><00:01:54.320><c> of</c>

00:01:54.389 --> 00:01:54.399 align:start position:0%
the first thing is like this concept of
 

00:01:54.399 --> 00:01:56.469 align:start position:0%
the first thing is like this concept of
missed<00:01:54.799><c> milestones</c><00:01:55.439><c> i</c><00:01:55.520><c> think</c><00:01:55.759><c> is</c><00:01:55.840><c> like</c><00:01:56.079><c> not</c>

00:01:56.469 --> 00:01:56.479 align:start position:0%
missed milestones i think is like not
 

00:01:56.479 --> 00:01:58.550 align:start position:0%
missed milestones i think is like not
really<00:01:56.880><c> accurate</c><00:01:57.360><c> so</c><00:01:57.520><c> we</c><00:01:57.680><c> see</c><00:01:57.840><c> this</c><00:01:58.079><c> a</c><00:01:58.159><c> lot</c><00:01:58.399><c> for</c>

00:01:58.550 --> 00:01:58.560 align:start position:0%
really accurate so we see this a lot for
 

00:01:58.560 --> 00:01:59.590 align:start position:0%

00:06:33.520 --> 00:06:35.510 align:start position:0%
like
that<00:06:33.680><c> was</c><00:06:34.000><c> three</c><00:06:34.319><c> or</c><00:06:34.479><c> four</c><00:06:34.720><c> years</c><00:06:35.039><c> old</c><00:06:35.280><c> with</c>

00:06:35.510 --> 00:06:35.520 align:start position:0%
that was three or four years old with
 

00:06:35.520 --> 00:06:37.270 align:start position:0%
that was three or four years old with
like<00:06:35.680><c> no</c><00:06:35.919><c> work</c><00:06:36.160><c> experience</c><00:06:36.800><c> some</c><00:06:37.039><c> work</c>

significant
so

00:06:41.189 --> 00:06:41.199 align:start position:0%
so
 

00:06:41.199 --> 00:06:42.469 align:start position:0%
so
you<00:06:41.280><c> know</c><00:06:41.440><c> you</c><00:06:41.600><c> kind</c><00:06:41.759><c> of</c><00:06:41.840><c> like</c><00:06:42.000><c> get</c><00:06:42.240><c> to</c><00:06:42.319><c> that</c>

point<00:06:42.720><c> in</c><00:06:42.800><c> life</c><00:06:43.039><c> and</c><00:06:43.120><c> you're</c><00:06:43.280><c> thinking</c><00:06:43.600><c> like</c>

00:06:43.830 --> 00:06:43.840 align:start position:0%
point in life and you're thinking like
 

00:06:43.840 --> 00:06:45.510 align:start position:0%
point in life and you're thinking like

00:06:47.749 --> 00:06:47.759 align:start position:0%
i'm basically screwed and so i still
 

00:06:47.759 --> 00:06:49.749 align:start position:0%
i'm basically screwed and so i still

00:06:49.749 --> 00:06:49.759 align:start position:0%
remember applying to medical school and
 

00:06:49.759 --> 00:06:51.589 align:start position:0%
remember applying to medical school and
kind<00:06:49.919><c> of</c><00:06:50.000><c> thinking</c><00:06:50.400><c> like</c><00:06:50.560><c> oh</c><00:06:50.800><c> in</c><00:06:50.960><c> four</c><00:06:51.280><c> years</c>

00:06:51.589 --> 00:06:51.599 align:start position:0%
kind of thinking like oh in four years
 

00:06:51.599 --> 00:06:53.670 align:start position:0%
kind of thinking like oh in four years
if<00:06:51.759><c> i</c><00:06:51.919><c> graduate</c><00:06:52.400><c> like</c><00:06:52.560><c> if</c><00:06:52.720><c> i</c><00:06:52.800><c> start</c><00:06:53.039><c> med</c><00:06:53.280><c> school</c>

00:06:53.670 --> 00:06:53.680 align:start position:0%
if i graduate like if i start med school
 

00:06:53.680 --> 00:06:56.150 align:start position:0%
if i graduate like if i start med school
if<00:06:53.840><c> i</c><00:06:53.919><c> apply</c><00:06:54.240><c> at</c><00:06:54.319><c> 26</c><00:06:55.039><c> i</c><00:06:55.199><c> could</c><00:06:55.360><c> potentially</c><00:06:55.919><c> get</c>

00:06:56.150 --> 00:06:56.160 align:start position:0%
if i apply at 26 i could potentially get
 

00:06:56.160 --> 00:06:57.909 align:start position:0%
if i apply at 26 i could potentially get
in<00:06:56.400><c> because</c><00:06:56.639><c> the</c><00:06:56.720><c> application</c><00:06:57.280><c> cycle</c><00:06:57.599><c> is</c><00:06:57.759><c> like</c>

00:06:57.909 --> 00:06:57.919 align:start position:0%
in because the application cycle is like
 

00:06:57.919 --> 00:06:59.670 align:start position:0%
in because the application cycle is like
one<00:06:58.160><c> year</c><00:06:58.720><c> and</c><00:06:58.800><c> then</c><00:06:58.960><c> you</c><00:06:59.120><c> get</c><00:06:59.280><c> in</c><00:06:59.440><c> for</c><00:06:59.599><c> the</c>

00:06:59.670 --> 00:06:59.680 align:start position:0%
one year and then you get in for the
 

00:06:59.680 --> 00:07:01.270 align:start position:0%
one year and then you get in for the
next<00:06:59.919><c> year</c><00:07:00.160><c> so</c><00:07:00.319><c> most</c><00:07:00.560><c> people</c><00:07:00.720><c> will</c><00:07:00.960><c> apply</c>

00:07:01.270 --> 00:07:01.280 align:start position:0%
next year so most people will apply
 

00:07:01.280 --> 00:07:03.189 align:start position:0%
next year so most people will apply
their<00:07:01.440><c> junior</c><00:07:01.840><c> year</c><00:07:02.080><c> of</c><00:07:02.240><c> college</c><00:07:02.880><c> so</c><00:07:03.039><c> that</c>

00:07:03.189 --> 00:07:03.199 align:start position:0%
their junior year of college so that
 

00:07:03.199 --> 00:07:04.790 align:start position:0%
their junior year of college so that
they<00:07:03.360><c> can</c><00:07:03.520><c> start</c><00:07:03.840><c> after</c><00:07:04.160><c> their</c><00:07:04.319><c> senior</c><00:07:04.639><c> year</c>

00:07:04.790 --> 00:07:04.800 align:start position:0%
they can start after their senior year
 

00:07:04.800 --> 00:07:06.309 align:start position:0%
they can start after their senior year
so<00:07:04.880><c> there's</c><00:07:05.039><c> like</c><00:07:05.199><c> a</c><00:07:05.280><c> two-year</c><00:07:05.759><c> lag</c><00:07:06.000><c> time</c><00:07:06.160><c> for</c>

00:07:06.309 --> 00:07:06.319 align:start position:0%
so there's like a two-year lag time for
 

00:07:06.319 --> 00:07:08.710 align:start position:0%
so there's like a two-year lag time for
med<00:07:06.560><c> school</c><00:07:07.280><c> so</c><00:07:07.440><c> i</c><00:07:07.440><c> was</c><00:07:07.599><c> like</c><00:07:07.680><c> if</c><00:07:07.840><c> i</c><00:07:07.919><c> apply</c><00:07:08.240><c> now</c>

that human beings can't be both but the

you guys just a couple of examples so
 

00:14:09.440 --> 00:14:11.030 align:start position:0%
you guys just a couple of examples so
one<00:14:09.760><c> is</c><00:14:09.839><c> that</c><00:14:10.000><c> people</c><00:14:10.320><c> start</c><00:14:10.560><c> working</c><00:14:10.880><c> on</c>

00:14:11.030 --> 00:14:11.040 align:start position:0%
one is that people start working on
 

00:14:11.040 --> 00:14:12.310 align:start position:0%
one is that people start working on
something<00:14:11.360><c> that</c><00:14:11.440><c> i</c><00:14:11.600><c> call</c><00:14:11.839><c> the</c><00:14:12.000><c> hidden</c>

over the course of 12 to 40 weeks what

are some neuroscience changes that we
 

00:14:52.720 --> 00:14:54.550 align:start position:0%
are some neuroscience changes that we

because then their brain
is<00:16:05.199><c> able</c><00:16:05.440><c> to</c><00:16:05.600><c> produce</c><00:16:06.240><c> what</c><00:16:06.560><c> i</c><00:16:06.800><c> offer</c><00:16:07.120><c> them</c><00:16:07.759><c> and</c>

00:16:13.829 --> 00:16:13.839 align:start position:0%
they become trained in like saying and
 

00:16:13.839 --> 00:16:15.509 align:start position:0%
they become trained in like saying and
thinking<00:16:14.240><c> the</c><00:16:14.320><c> way</c><00:16:14.480><c> that</c><00:16:14.720><c> i</c><00:16:14.880><c> do</c><00:16:15.360><c> they</c>

00:16:15.509 --> 00:16:15.519 align:start position:0%
thinking the way that i do they
 

00:16:15.519 --> 00:16:17.430 align:start position:0%
thinking the way that i do they
basically<00:16:16.000><c> learn</c><00:16:16.320><c> that</c><00:16:16.560><c> way</c><00:16:16.720><c> of</c><00:16:16.880><c> thinking</c><00:16:17.360><c> and</c>

00:16:17.430 --> 00:16:17.440 align:start position:0%
basically learn that way of thinking and
 

00:16:17.440 --> 00:16:19.430 align:start position:0%
basically learn that way of thinking and
then<00:16:17.600><c> they</c><00:16:17.759><c> no</c><00:16:17.920><c> longer</c><00:16:18.480><c> need</c><00:16:18.720><c> me</c><00:16:18.959><c> then</c><00:16:19.199><c> they're</c>

00:16:19.430 --> 00:16:19.440 align:start position:0%
then they no longer need me then they're
 

00:16:19.440 --> 00:16:20.230 align:start position:0%
then they no longer need me then they're
like

00:16:20.230 --> 00:16:20.240 align:start position:0%
like
 

00:16:20.240 --> 00:16:21.749 align:start position:0%
like
kind<00:16:20.399><c> of</c><00:16:20.480><c> fixed</c><00:16:20.720><c> right</c><00:16:20.880><c> so</c><00:16:21.040><c> that's</c><00:16:21.279><c> like</c>

00:16:21.749 --> 00:16:21.759 align:start position:0%
kind of fixed right so that's like
 

00:16:21.759 --> 00:16:24.629 align:start position:0%
kind of fixed right so that's like
literally<00:16:22.240><c> changing</c><00:16:22.720><c> your</c><00:16:22.880><c> self-talk</c>
