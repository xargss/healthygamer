right<00:05:51.919><c> because</c><00:05:52.160><c> they</c><00:05:52.479><c> had</c><00:05:52.800><c> their</c><00:05:53.120><c> system</c>

00:05:54.710 --> 00:05:54.720 align:start position:0%
right because they had their system
 

00:05:54.720 --> 00:05:56.950 align:start position:0%
right because they had their system

00:05:58.720 --> 00:06:00.950 align:start position:0%
jive with their system

00:06:00.950 --> 00:06:00.960 align:start position:0%
and so they couldn't deal with it so if
 

00:06:00.960 --> 00:06:02.629 align:start position:0%
and so they couldn't deal with it so if

00:06:02.629 --> 00:06:02.639 align:start position:0%
you look at institutions like when
 

00:06:02.639 --> 00:06:04.070 align:start position:0%
you look at institutions like when
allegations<00:06:03.280><c> of</c><00:06:03.440><c> sexual</c>

00:06:06.550 --> 00:06:06.560 align:start position:0%
problems started coming out the the
 

00:06:06.560 --> 00:06:09.029 align:start position:0%

00:06:09.029 --> 00:06:09.039 align:start position:0%
bitter oriented institutions were like
 

00:06:09.039 --> 00:06:10.790 align:start position:0%
bitter oriented institutions were like
we<00:06:09.280><c> can't</c><00:06:09.600><c> deal</c><00:06:09.840><c> with</c><00:06:10.000><c> this</c><00:06:10.240><c> so</c><00:06:10.400><c> we're</c><00:06:10.560><c> gonna</c>

00:06:10.790 --> 00:06:10.800 align:start position:0%
we can't deal with this so we're gonna
 

00:06:10.800 --> 00:06:14.150 align:start position:0%
we can't deal with this so we're gonna
pretend<00:06:11.280><c> it's</c><00:06:11.520><c> not</c><00:06:11.840><c> there</c>

00:06:14.150 --> 00:06:14.160 align:start position:0%
pretend it's not there
 

00:06:14.160 --> 00:06:16.629 align:start position:0%
pretend it's not there
meanwhile<00:06:14.960><c> you</c><00:06:15.120><c> look</c><00:06:15.360><c> at</c><00:06:15.520><c> twitter</c><00:06:16.400><c> where</c>

00:06:16.629 --> 00:06:16.639 align:start position:0%
meanwhile you look at twitter where
 

00:06:16.639 --> 00:06:18.390 align:start position:0%
meanwhile you look at twitter where
twitter<00:06:17.120><c> is</c><00:06:17.280><c> supervata</c>

00:06:18.390 --> 00:06:18.400 align:start position:0%
twitter is supervata
 

00:06:18.400 --> 00:06:20.390 align:start position:0%
twitter is supervata
so<00:06:18.639><c> twitter</c><00:06:19.120><c> like</c><00:06:19.360><c> could</c><00:06:19.600><c> handle</c><00:06:19.840><c> the</c><00:06:20.000><c> metoo</c>

00:06:20.390 --> 00:06:20.400 align:start position:0%
so twitter like could handle the metoo
 

00:06:20.400 --> 00:06:21.749 align:start position:0%
so twitter like could handle the metoo
movement<00:06:20.720><c> like</c><00:06:21.039><c> that</c>

00:06:21.749 --> 00:06:21.759 align:start position:0%
movement like that
 

00:06:21.759 --> 00:06:23.990 align:start position:0%
movement like that
right<00:06:22.080><c> like</c><00:06:22.560><c> twitter</c><00:06:23.039><c> is</c><00:06:23.120><c> adaptable</c><00:06:23.840><c> it's</c>

00:06:23.990 --> 00:06:24.000 align:start position:0%
right like twitter is adaptable it's
 

00:06:24.000 --> 00:06:26.469 align:start position:0%
right like twitter is adaptable it's
dynamic<00:06:24.639><c> it</c><00:06:24.800><c> has</c><00:06:24.960><c> a</c><00:06:25.039><c> short</c><00:06:25.360><c> attention</c><00:06:25.759><c> span</c>

00:06:26.469 --> 00:06:26.479 align:start position:0%
dynamic it has a short attention span
 

00:06:26.479 --> 00:06:27.749 align:start position:0%
dynamic it has a short attention span
and<00:06:26.639><c> so</c><00:06:26.800><c> when</c><00:06:26.880><c> something</c><00:06:27.120><c> like</c><00:06:27.280><c> the</c><00:06:27.360><c> metoo</c>

00:06:27.749 --> 00:06:27.759 align:start position:0%
and so when something like the metoo
 

00:06:27.759 --> 00:06:29.909 align:start position:0%
and so when something like the metoo
movement<00:06:28.160><c> arises</c><00:06:28.720><c> twitter</c><00:06:29.039><c> can</c><00:06:29.199><c> respond</c><00:06:29.680><c> to</c>

00:06:29.909 --> 00:06:29.919 align:start position:0%
movement arises twitter can respond to
 

00:06:29.919 --> 00:06:31.990 align:start position:0%
movement arises twitter can respond to
it<00:06:30.080><c> very</c><00:06:30.240><c> quickly</c>

00:06:31.990 --> 00:06:32.000 align:start position:0%
it very quickly
 

00:06:32.000 --> 00:06:33.990 align:start position:0%
it very quickly
so<00:06:32.160><c> it's</c><00:06:32.400><c> not</c><00:06:32.639><c> that</c><00:06:32.880><c> being</c><00:06:33.360><c> ambitious</c><00:06:33.919><c> and</c>

00:06:33.990 --> 00:06:34.000 align:start position:0%
so it's not that being ambitious and
 

00:06:34.000 --> 00:06:36.629 align:start position:0%
so it's not that being ambitious and
disciplined<00:06:34.479><c> is</c><00:06:34.720><c> better</c>

00:06:36.629 --> 00:06:36.639 align:start position:0%
disciplined is better
 

00:06:36.639 --> 00:06:39.110 align:start position:0%
disciplined is better
it's<00:06:36.880><c> that</c><00:06:37.199><c> most</c><00:06:37.520><c> of</c><00:06:37.680><c> our</c><00:06:37.759><c> structures</c><00:06:38.720><c> are</c>

00:06:39.110 --> 00:06:39.120 align:start position:0%
it's that most of our structures are
