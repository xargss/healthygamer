00:02:05.240 --> 00:02:08.290 align:start position:0%
build up everything in my life around
being<00:02:06.170><c> with</c><00:02:06.410><c> her</c><00:02:06.620><c> and</c><00:02:06.830><c> nothing</c><00:02:07.460><c> about</c><00:02:07.880><c> being</c>

far I had in the future was based really
 

00:02:13.600 --> 00:02:17.050 align:start position:0%
far I had in the future was based really
around<00:02:14.600><c> being</c><00:02:15.320><c> with</c><00:02:15.530><c> her</c><00:02:15.770><c> and</c><00:02:15.950><c> not</c><00:02:16.610><c> being</c><00:02:16.910><c> with</c>

00:02:17.050 --> 00:02:17.060 align:start position:0%
around being with her and not being with

around being with her and not being with
my<00:02:17.090><c> like</c><00:02:17.720><c> with</c><00:02:18.080><c> myself</c><00:02:18.530><c> laughing</c><00:02:21.670><c> yeah</c><00:02:22.930><c> yeah</c>

00:02:23.950 --> 00:02:23.960 align:start position:0%
my like with myself laughing yeah yeah
 

00:02:23.960 --> 00:02:26.470 align:start position:0%
my like with myself laughing yeah yeah
so<00:02:24.320><c> I</c><00:02:24.350><c> think</c><00:02:24.560><c> that's</c><00:02:24.890><c> that's</c><00:02:25.340><c> so</c><00:02:25.970><c> I</c><00:02:26.000><c> think</c><00:02:26.240><c> this</c>

00:02:26.470 --> 00:02:26.480 align:start position:0%
so I think that's that's so I think this
 

00:02:26.480 --> 00:02:28.000 align:start position:0%
so I think that's that's so I think this
is<00:02:26.600><c> gonna</c><00:02:26.720><c> be</c><00:02:26.900><c> a</c><00:02:26.930><c> short</c><00:02:27.230><c> call</c><00:02:27.440><c> you're</c><00:02:27.710><c> welcome</c>

00:02:28.000 --> 00:02:28.010 align:start position:0%
is gonna be a short call you're welcome
 

00:02:28.010 --> 00:02:30.190 align:start position:0%
is gonna be a short call you're welcome
to<00:02:28.130><c> come</c><00:02:28.250><c> back</c><00:02:28.430><c> on</c><00:02:28.640><c> later</c><00:02:28.850><c> but</c><00:02:29.780><c> I</c><00:02:29.810><c> think</c><00:02:30.050><c> that's</c>

00:02:30.190 --> 00:02:30.200 align:start position:0%
to come back on later but I think that's
 

00:02:30.200 --> 00:02:32.800 align:start position:0%
to come back on later but I think that's
the<00:02:30.440><c> crux</c><00:02:30.650><c> of</c><00:02:30.890><c> it</c><00:02:30.950><c> right</c><00:02:31.420><c> so</c><00:02:32.420><c> here's</c><00:02:32.750><c> the</c>

00:02:32.800 --> 00:02:32.810 align:start position:0%
the crux of it right so here's the
 

00:02:32.810 --> 00:02:34.270 align:start position:0%
the crux of it right so here's the
reason<00:02:33.230><c> that</c><00:02:33.350><c> you</c><00:02:33.470><c> don't</c><00:02:33.620><c> have</c><00:02:33.770><c> a</c><00:02:33.830><c> life</c><00:02:34.070><c> worth</c>

00:02:34.270 --> 00:02:34.280 align:start position:0%
reason that you don't have a life worth
 

00:02:34.280 --> 00:02:36.970 align:start position:0%
reason that you don't have a life worth
living<00:02:34.640><c> is</c><00:02:34.760><c> because</c><00:02:34.910><c> you</c><00:02:35.300><c> constructed</c><00:02:36.290><c> this</c>

00:02:36.970 --> 00:02:36.980 align:start position:0%
living is because you constructed this
 

00:02:36.980 --> 00:02:40.820 align:start position:0%
living is because you constructed this
castle<00:02:37.640><c> of</c><00:02:37.880><c> a</c><00:02:37.970><c> life</c><00:02:38.180><c> with</c><00:02:38.420><c> her</c><00:02:38.570><c> in</c><00:02:38.780><c> your</c><00:02:38.840><c> mind</c>

00:02:40.820 --> 00:02:40.830 align:start position:0%
castle of a life with her in your mind
 

00:02:40.830 --> 00:02:43.250 align:start position:0%

and<00:02:40.920><c> so</c><00:02:41.880><c> that</c><00:02:42.090><c> was</c><00:02:42.360><c> the</c><00:02:42.390><c> life</c><00:02:42.660><c> that</c><00:02:42.900><c> was</c><00:02:43.050><c> worth</c>

00:02:43.250 --> 00:02:43.260 align:start position:0%
and so that was the life that was worth
 

00:02:43.260 --> 00:02:45.450 align:start position:0%
and so that was the life that was worth
living

00:02:45.450 --> 00:02:45.460 align:start position:0%

very significant now this is the other
 

00:12:37.339 --> 00:12:38.949 align:start position:0%
very significant now this is the other
problem<00:12:37.760><c> as</c><00:12:37.850><c> people</c><00:12:37.880><c> confuse</c><00:12:38.510><c> like</c><00:12:38.690><c> trauma</c>

00:12:40.389 --> 00:12:40.399 align:start position:0%
with depression because both of them
 

00:12:40.399 --> 00:12:42.340 align:start position:0%
with depression because both of them
make<00:12:40.580><c> you</c><00:12:40.700><c> feel</c><00:12:41.000><c> like</c><00:12:41.600><c> not</c><00:12:41.810><c> doing</c><00:12:41.839><c> anything</c>

00:12:42.340 --> 00:12:42.350 align:start position:0%
make you feel like not doing anything
 

00:12:42.350 --> 00:12:44.500 align:start position:0%
make you feel like not doing anything
but<00:12:43.100><c> I</c><00:12:43.160><c> think</c><00:12:43.279><c> the</c><00:12:43.459><c> origins</c><00:12:44.000><c> of</c><00:12:44.149><c> these</c><00:12:44.300><c> two</c>

00:12:44.500 --> 00:12:44.510 align:start position:0%
but I think the origins of these two
 

00:12:44.510 --> 00:12:46.450 align:start position:0%
but I think the origins of these two
things<00:12:44.779><c> are</c><00:12:44.959><c> very</c><00:12:44.990><c> different</c>

00:12:46.450 --> 00:12:46.460 align:start position:0%
things are very different
 

00:12:46.460 --> 00:12:49.360 align:start position:0%
things are very different
so<00:12:47.450><c> if</c><00:12:47.690><c> your</c><00:12:47.870><c> root</c><00:12:48.140><c> problem</c><00:12:48.710><c> is</c><00:12:48.860><c> that</c><00:12:49.160><c> you</c>

00:12:49.360 --> 00:12:49.370 align:start position:0%
so if your root problem is that you
 

00:12:49.370 --> 00:12:50.829 align:start position:0%
so if your root problem is that you
started<00:12:49.790><c> to</c><00:12:49.910><c> feel</c><00:12:50.060><c> like</c><00:12:50.300><c> life</c><00:12:50.570><c> was</c>

00:12:50.829 --> 00:12:50.839 align:start position:0%
started to feel like life was
 

00:12:50.839 --> 00:12:52.480 align:start position:0%
