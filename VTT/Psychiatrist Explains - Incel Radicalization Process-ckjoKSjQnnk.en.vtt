00:01:19.270 --> 00:01:19.280 align:start position:0%
help people understand that they have
 

00:01:19.280 --> 00:01:21.030 align:start position:0%
help people understand that they have

00:01:21.030 --> 00:01:21.040 align:start position:0%

00:01:23.109 --> 00:01:23.119 align:start position:0%
sort of in-cell kind of
 

00:01:23.119 --> 00:01:25.030 align:start position:0%
sort of in-cell kind of

00:01:25.030 --> 00:01:25.040 align:start position:0%
thinking and belief system may not be
 

00:01:25.040 --> 00:01:26.710 align:start position:0%

00:01:26.710 --> 00:01:26.720 align:start position:0%
entirely correct
 

00:01:26.720 --> 00:01:28.070 align:start position:0%

so<00:01:26.960><c> there</c><00:01:27.119><c> are</c><00:01:27.119><c> a</c><00:01:27.200><c> couple</c><00:01:27.520><c> of</c><00:01:27.600><c> things</c><00:01:27.840><c> that</c><00:01:28.000><c> i</c>

00:01:28.070 --> 00:01:28.080 align:start position:0%
so there are a couple of things that i
 

00:01:28.080 --> 00:01:29.429 align:start position:0%
so there are a couple of things that i
want<00:01:28.240><c> to</c><00:01:28.320><c> point</c><00:01:28.640><c> out</c><00:01:28.799><c> the</c><00:01:28.880><c> first</c><00:01:29.200><c> is</c><00:01:29.280><c> that</c>

00:01:29.429 --> 00:01:29.439 align:start position:0%
want to point out the first is that
 

00:01:29.439 --> 00:01:30.870 align:start position:0%
want to point out the first is that
generally<00:01:29.920><c> speaking</c><00:01:30.320><c> incel</c>

00:01:30.870 --> 00:01:30.880 align:start position:0%

00:01:33.840 --> 00:01:35.109 align:start position:0%

00:01:35.109 --> 00:01:35.119 align:start position:0%

00:01:35.830 --> 00:01:35.840 align:start position:0%

00:01:43.429 --> 00:01:43.439 align:start position:0%
they're actually like female people who

they're actually like female people who

00:01:45.109 --> 00:01:45.119 align:start position:0%
identify with the term incel so i think
 

00:01:45.119 --> 00:01:46.469 align:start position:0%
identify with the term incel so i think
that's<00:01:45.360><c> a</c><00:01:45.520><c> huge</c><00:01:45.920><c> problem</c>

00:01:46.469 --> 00:01:46.479 align:start position:0%
that's a huge problem
 

00:01:46.479 --> 00:01:48.230 align:start position:0%
that's a huge problem
in<00:01:46.640><c> like</c><00:01:46.799><c> the</c><00:01:46.960><c> published</c><00:01:47.360><c> literature</c><00:01:48.079><c> in</c><00:01:48.159><c> the</c>

00:01:48.230 --> 00:01:48.240 align:start position:0%
in like the published literature in the
 

00:01:48.240 --> 00:01:50.469 align:start position:0%
in like the published literature in the

way that people look at things
 

00:01:50.479 --> 00:01:52.230 align:start position:0%
way that people look at things
so<00:01:50.640><c> i</c><00:01:50.720><c> think</c><00:01:50.960><c> that</c><00:01:51.280><c> you</c><00:01:51.360><c> know</c><00:01:51.439><c> this</c><00:01:51.680><c> sort</c><00:01:51.840><c> of</c>

00:01:52.230 --> 00:01:52.240 align:start position:0%

00:02:29.350 --> 00:02:29.360 align:start position:0%
both people pick right so the whole idea
 

00:02:29.360 --> 00:02:31.030 align:start position:0%
both people pick right so the whole idea
behind<00:02:29.680><c> a</c><00:02:29.760><c> partnership</c><00:02:30.319><c> is</c><00:02:30.480><c> that</c><00:02:30.560><c> it's</c><00:02:30.720><c> like</c><00:02:30.879><c> a</c>

00:02:31.030 --> 00:02:31.040 align:start position:0%
behind a partnership is that it's like a

behind a partnership is that it's like a

definitely get into the sort of

there's<00:02:41.840><c> a</c><00:02:41.920><c> power</c><00:02:42.160><c> dynamic</c><00:02:42.560><c> so</c><00:02:42.720><c> don't</c><00:02:42.879><c> get</c><00:02:42.959><c> me</c>

00:02:43.110 --> 00:02:43.120 align:start position:0%
there's a power dynamic so don't get me
 

00:02:43.120 --> 00:02:44.630 align:start position:0%
there's a power dynamic so don't get me

00:02:44.630 --> 00:02:44.640 align:start position:0%
wrong there that's definitely possible
 

00:02:44.640 --> 00:02:46.390 align:start position:0%
wrong there that's definitely possible
but<00:02:44.879><c> i</c><00:02:44.959><c> think</c><00:02:45.120><c> that</c><00:02:45.280><c> generally</c><00:02:45.760><c> speaking</c>

00:02:46.390 --> 00:02:46.400 align:start position:0%
but i think that generally speaking
 

00:02:46.400 --> 00:02:48.390 align:start position:0%
but i think that generally speaking
if<00:02:46.560><c> you</c><00:02:46.640><c> think</c><00:02:46.800><c> about</c><00:02:47.040><c> a</c><00:02:47.120><c> relationship</c><00:02:48.239><c> it's</c>

00:02:48.390 --> 00:02:48.400 align:start position:0%
if you think about a relationship it's
 

00:02:48.400 --> 00:02:50.229 align:start position:0%
if you think about a relationship it's
like<00:02:48.640><c> the</c><00:02:48.800><c> whole</c><00:02:49.360><c> point</c><00:02:49.680><c> is</c><00:02:49.760><c> that</c><00:02:49.920><c> there's</c><00:02:50.160><c> a</c>

00:02:50.229 --> 00:02:50.239 align:start position:0%
like the whole point is that there's a
 

00:02:50.239 --> 00:02:51.750 align:start position:0%
like the whole point is that there's a
relation<00:02:50.800><c> right</c><00:02:50.959><c> so</c><00:02:51.120><c> there's</c><00:02:51.360><c> like</c>

00:02:51.750 --> 00:02:51.760 align:start position:0%
relation right so there's like
 

00:02:51.760 --> 00:02:53.589 align:start position:0%
relation right so there's like
both<00:02:52.000><c> people</c><00:02:52.400><c> are</c><00:02:52.560><c> sort</c><00:02:52.720><c> of</c><00:02:52.879><c> agreeing</c><00:02:53.280><c> to</c><00:02:53.440><c> have</c>

00:02:53.589 --> 00:02:53.599 align:start position:0%
both people are sort of agreeing to have
 

00:02:53.599 --> 00:02:54.869 align:start position:0%
both people are sort of agreeing to have
this<00:02:53.840><c> relationship</c>

00:02:54.869 --> 00:02:54.879 align:start position:0%
this relationship
 

00:02:54.879 --> 00:02:57.110 align:start position:0%
this relationship
and<00:02:55.120><c> so</c><00:02:55.680><c> i</c><00:02:56.000><c> think</c><00:02:56.160><c> the</c><00:02:56.319><c> problem</c><00:02:56.720><c> here</c><00:02:56.879><c> is</c><00:02:57.040><c> that</c>

00:02:57.110 --> 00:02:57.120 align:start position:0%
and so i think the problem here is that
 

00:02:57.120 --> 00:02:58.869 align:start position:0%
and so i think the problem here is that
if<00:02:57.200><c> we</c><00:02:57.360><c> listen</c><00:02:57.599><c> to</c><00:02:57.680><c> what</c><00:02:57.840><c> this</c><00:02:58.000><c> person</c><00:02:58.319><c> says</c>

00:02:58.869 --> 00:02:58.879 align:start position:0%
if we listen to what this person says
 

00:02:58.879 --> 00:03:00.790 align:start position:0%
if we listen to what this person says
they're<00:02:59.120><c> saying</c><00:02:59.840><c> women</c><00:03:00.239><c> are</c><00:03:00.319><c> the</c><00:03:00.400><c> ones</c><00:03:00.640><c> who</c>

00:03:00.790 --> 00:03:00.800 align:start position:0%
they're saying women are the ones who
 

00:03:00.800 --> 00:03:02.309 align:start position:0%
they're saying women are the ones who
get<00:03:00.959><c> to</c><00:03:01.040><c> pick</c><00:03:01.360><c> and</c><00:03:01.440><c> i</c><00:03:01.680><c> i</c>

00:03:02.309 --> 00:03:02.319 align:start position:0%
get to pick and i i
 

00:03:02.319 --> 00:03:04.470 align:start position:0%
get to pick and i i
have<00:03:02.560><c> the</c><00:03:02.720><c> opposite</c><00:03:03.360><c> problem</c><00:03:03.840><c> so</c><00:03:04.080><c> i'm</c><00:03:04.239><c> not</c>

00:03:04.470 --> 00:03:04.480 align:start position:0%
have the opposite problem so i'm not
 

00:03:04.480 --> 00:03:06.149 align:start position:0%
have the opposite problem so i'm not
like<00:03:04.640><c> most</c><00:03:04.959><c> women</c><00:03:05.280><c> therefore</c><00:03:05.760><c> i</c><00:03:05.920><c> feel</c>

00:03:06.149 --> 00:03:06.159 align:start position:0%
like most women therefore i feel
 

00:03:06.159 --> 00:03:07.270 align:start position:0%
like most women therefore i feel
subhuman

00:03:07.270 --> 00:03:07.280 align:start position:0%
subhuman
 

00:03:07.280 --> 00:03:08.710 align:start position:0%
subhuman
so<00:03:07.440><c> if</c><00:03:07.519><c> you</c><00:03:07.680><c> stop</c><00:03:07.920><c> and</c><00:03:08.000><c> think</c><00:03:08.239><c> about</c><00:03:08.480><c> it</c><00:03:08.560><c> for</c><00:03:08.640><c> a</c>

00:03:08.710 --> 00:03:08.720 align:start position:0%
so if you stop and think about it for a
 

00:03:08.720 --> 00:03:10.470 align:start position:0%
so if you stop and think about it for a
second<00:03:08.959><c> what</c><00:03:09.200><c> you</c><00:03:09.360><c> see</c><00:03:09.599><c> is</c><00:03:09.680><c> that</c><00:03:09.920><c> the</c><00:03:10.159><c> feeling</c>

00:03:10.470 --> 00:03:10.480 align:start position:0%
second what you see is that the feeling
 

00:03:10.480 --> 00:03:11.430 align:start position:0%
second what you see is that the feeling
of<00:03:10.640><c> sub-human</c>

00:03:11.430 --> 00:03:11.440 align:start position:0%
of sub-human
 

00:03:11.440 --> 00:03:14.710 align:start position:0%
of sub-human
is<00:03:11.760><c> rooted</c><00:03:12.800><c> in</c><00:03:13.040><c> the</c><00:03:13.280><c> idea</c>

00:03:14.710 --> 00:03:14.720 align:start position:0%
is rooted in the idea
 

00:03:14.720 --> 00:03:17.990 align:start position:0%
is rooted in the idea
that<00:03:16.560><c> most</c><00:03:16.879><c> people</c><00:03:17.200><c> are</c><00:03:17.440><c> one</c><00:03:17.680><c> way</c>

00:03:17.990 --> 00:03:18.000 align:start position:0%
that most people are one way
 

00:03:18.000 --> 00:03:21.270 align:start position:0%
that most people are one way
and<00:03:18.159><c> i</c><00:03:18.400><c> am</c><00:03:18.480><c> the</c><00:03:18.720><c> other</c><00:03:18.879><c> way</c><00:03:20.319><c> so</c><00:03:20.560><c> it</c><00:03:20.959><c> it's</c>

00:03:21.270 --> 00:03:21.280 align:start position:0%
and i am the other way so it it's
 

00:03:21.280 --> 00:03:22.309 align:start position:0%
and i am the other way so it it's
interesting<00:03:21.680><c> because</c><00:03:21.920><c> like</c>

00:03:22.309 --> 00:03:22.319 align:start position:0%
interesting because like
 

00:03:22.319 --> 00:03:23.990 align:start position:0%
interesting because like
where<00:03:22.720><c> where</c><00:03:22.959><c> do</c><00:03:23.040><c> you</c><00:03:23.200><c> get</c><00:03:23.360><c> the</c><00:03:23.519><c> idea</c><00:03:23.840><c> that</c>

00:03:23.990 --> 00:03:24.000 align:start position:0%
where where do you get the idea that
 

00:03:24.000 --> 00:03:26.149 align:start position:0%
where where do you get the idea that
most<00:03:24.319><c> women</c><00:03:24.799><c> women</c><00:03:25.200><c> are</c><00:03:25.360><c> one</c><00:03:25.599><c> way</c><00:03:25.920><c> and</c><00:03:26.000><c> that</c>

00:03:26.149 --> 00:03:26.159 align:start position:0%
most women women are one way and that
 

00:03:26.159 --> 00:03:27.350 align:start position:0%
most women women are one way and that
you're<00:03:26.480><c> a</c><00:03:26.560><c> different</c><00:03:26.879><c> way</c>

00:03:27.350 --> 00:03:27.360 align:start position:0%
you're a different way
 

00:03:27.360 --> 00:03:29.110 align:start position:0%
you're a different way
so<00:03:27.599><c> i</c><00:03:27.680><c> think</c><00:03:28.080><c> there's</c><00:03:28.319><c> also</c><00:03:28.560><c> something</c><00:03:28.879><c> that's</c>

00:03:29.110 --> 00:03:29.120 align:start position:0%
so i think there's also something that's
 

00:03:29.120 --> 00:03:30.630 align:start position:0%
so i think there's also something that's
that's<00:03:29.360><c> very</c><00:03:29.599><c> common</c><00:03:29.920><c> for</c><00:03:30.080><c> people</c><00:03:30.319><c> which</c><00:03:30.480><c> is</c>

00:03:30.630 --> 00:03:30.640 align:start position:0%
that's very common for people which is
 

00:03:30.640 --> 00:03:31.910 align:start position:0%
that's very common for people which is
that<00:03:30.720><c> they</c><00:03:30.879><c> feel</c><00:03:31.120><c> like</c><00:03:31.280><c> they're</c><00:03:31.440><c> running</c><00:03:31.760><c> out</c>

00:03:31.910 --> 00:03:31.920 align:start position:0%
that they feel like they're running out
 

00:03:31.920 --> 00:03:33.430 align:start position:0%
that they feel like they're running out
of<00:03:32.000><c> time</c><00:03:32.239><c> to</c><00:03:32.480><c> experience</c><00:03:32.879><c> a</c><00:03:32.959><c> romantic</c>

00:03:33.430 --> 00:03:33.440 align:start position:0%
of time to experience a romantic
 

00:03:33.440 --> 00:03:34.789 align:start position:0%
of time to experience a romantic
relationship

00:03:34.789 --> 00:03:34.799 align:start position:0%
relationship
 

00:03:34.799 --> 00:03:36.550 align:start position:0%
relationship
and<00:03:34.959><c> that</c><00:03:35.120><c> makes</c><00:03:35.360><c> sense</c><00:03:35.680><c> like</c><00:03:35.840><c> the</c><00:03:36.080><c> time</c><00:03:36.400><c> you</c>

00:03:36.550 --> 00:03:36.560 align:start position:0%
and that makes sense like the time you
 

00:03:36.560 --> 00:03:38.390 align:start position:0%
and that makes sense like the time you
know<00:03:36.640><c> the</c><00:03:36.799><c> hourglasses</c><00:03:37.680><c> is</c><00:03:37.840><c> kind</c><00:03:38.000><c> of</c><00:03:38.080><c> going</c>

00:03:38.390 --> 00:03:38.400 align:start position:0%
know the hourglasses is kind of going
 

00:03:38.400 --> 00:03:39.509 align:start position:0%
know the hourglasses is kind of going
and<00:03:38.480><c> the</c><00:03:38.640><c> further</c><00:03:39.040><c> that</c><00:03:39.200><c> you</c>

things that we've discovered through our

00:03:45.990 --> 00:03:46.000 align:start position:0%
research i mean it's not
 

00:03:46.000 --> 00:03:48.070 align:start position:0%
research i mean it's not
like<00:03:46.400><c> this</c><00:03:46.640><c> stuff</c><00:03:46.959><c> is</c><00:03:47.040><c> sort</c><00:03:47.280><c> of</c><00:03:47.360><c> known</c><00:03:47.760><c> already</c>

00:03:48.070 --> 00:03:48.080 align:start position:0%
like this stuff is sort of known already
 

00:03:48.080 --> 00:03:49.589 align:start position:0%
like this stuff is sort of known already
but<00:03:48.239><c> like</c><00:03:48.400><c> this</c><00:03:48.560><c> is</c><00:03:48.640><c> what</c><00:03:48.799><c> we</c><00:03:48.959><c> piece</c><00:03:49.200><c> together</c>

00:03:49.589 --> 00:03:49.599 align:start position:0%
but like this is what we piece together
 

00:03:49.599 --> 00:03:50.949 align:start position:0%
but like this is what we piece together
is<00:03:49.680><c> maybe</c><00:03:49.920><c> a</c><00:03:50.000><c> better</c><00:03:50.159><c> way</c><00:03:50.319><c> to</c><00:03:50.400><c> put</c><00:03:50.560><c> it</c>

00:03:50.949 --> 00:03:50.959 align:start position:0%
is maybe a better way to put it
 

00:03:50.959 --> 00:03:53.110 align:start position:0%
is maybe a better way to put it
so<00:03:51.120><c> the</c><00:03:51.200><c> first</c><00:03:51.519><c> is</c><00:03:51.599><c> that</c><00:03:51.840><c> when</c><00:03:52.159><c> people</c><00:03:52.799><c> are</c><00:03:52.959><c> in</c>

00:03:53.110 --> 00:03:53.120 align:start position:0%
so the first is that when people are in
 

00:03:53.120 --> 00:03:54.149 align:start position:0%
so the first is that when people are in
cells<00:03:53.680><c> that</c>

00:03:54.149 --> 00:03:54.159 align:start position:0%
cells that
 

00:03:54.159 --> 00:03:55.429 align:start position:0%
cells that
it's<00:03:54.400><c> primarily</c><00:03:54.879><c> like</c><00:03:55.040><c> sort</c><00:03:55.200><c> of</c><00:03:55.360><c> a</c>

00:03:55.429 --> 00:03:55.439 align:start position:0%
it's primarily like sort of a
 

00:03:55.439 --> 00:03:57.750 align:start position:0%
it's primarily like sort of a
psychological<00:03:56.239><c> thing</c><00:03:56.720><c> so</c><00:03:56.879><c> it's</c><00:03:57.120><c> not</c><00:03:57.360><c> actually</c>

00:03:57.750 --> 00:03:57.760 align:start position:0%
psychological thing so it's not actually
 

00:03:57.760 --> 00:03:58.550 align:start position:0%
psychological thing so it's not actually
like

00:03:58.550 --> 00:03:58.560 align:start position:0%
like
 

00:03:58.560 --> 00:04:00.229 align:start position:0%
like
it's<00:03:58.720><c> a</c><00:03:58.799><c> belief</c><00:03:59.200><c> system</c><00:03:59.680><c> so</c><00:03:59.840><c> here's</c><00:04:00.080><c> what</c>

00:04:00.229 --> 00:04:00.239 align:start position:0%
it's a belief system so here's what
 

00:04:00.239 --> 00:04:01.670 align:start position:0%
it's a belief system so here's what
happens<00:04:00.560><c> with</c><00:04:00.720><c> an</c><00:04:00.879><c> insult</c>

00:04:01.670 --> 00:04:01.680 align:start position:0%
happens with an insult
 

00:04:01.680 --> 00:04:03.670 align:start position:0%
happens with an insult
so<00:04:01.840><c> they</c><00:04:02.080><c> start</c><00:04:02.319><c> out</c><00:04:02.480><c> with</c><00:04:02.720><c> usually</c><00:04:03.200><c> some</c><00:04:03.439><c> kind</c>

00:04:03.670 --> 00:04:03.680 align:start position:0%
so they start out with usually some kind
 

00:04:03.680 --> 00:04:04.710 align:start position:0%
so they start out with usually some kind
of<00:04:03.920><c> adverse</c>

00:04:04.710 --> 00:04:04.720 align:start position:0%
of adverse
 

00:04:04.720 --> 00:04:07.030 align:start position:0%
of adverse
experience<00:04:05.599><c> or</c><00:04:05.920><c> the</c><00:04:06.080><c> idea</c><00:04:06.400><c> of</c><00:04:06.560><c> a</c><00:04:06.640><c> missed</c>

00:04:07.030 --> 00:04:07.040 align:start position:0%

00:04:08.309 --> 00:04:08.319 align:start position:0%
milestone
 

00:04:08.319 --> 00:04:10.070 align:start position:0%
milestone
so<00:04:08.480><c> they</c><00:04:08.720><c> it's</c><00:04:08.959><c> not</c><00:04:09.120><c> even</c><00:04:09.360><c> like</c><00:04:09.519><c> necessarily</c>

00:04:10.070 --> 00:04:10.080 align:start position:0%
so they it's not even like necessarily
 

00:04:10.080 --> 00:04:11.670 align:start position:0%
so they it's not even like necessarily
something<00:04:10.480><c> bad</c><00:04:10.720><c> happened</c><00:04:11.040><c> to</c><00:04:11.120><c> them</c><00:04:11.280><c> but</c><00:04:11.439><c> they</c>

00:04:11.670 --> 00:04:11.680 align:start position:0%
something bad happened to them but they
 

00:04:11.680 --> 00:04:14.070 align:start position:0%
something bad happened to them but they

00:04:14.070 --> 00:04:14.080 align:start position:0%
turn 18 or they turn 21 or they graduate
 

00:04:14.080 --> 00:04:16.150 align:start position:0%
turn 18 or they turn 21 or they graduate
from<00:04:14.239><c> college</c><00:04:15.200><c> and</c><00:04:15.360><c> it</c><00:04:15.519><c> starts</c><00:04:15.840><c> with</c><00:04:16.000><c> this</c>

00:04:28.469 --> 00:04:28.479 align:start position:0%

00:04:28.479 --> 00:04:31.830 align:start position:0%
experience and then what's really
changed<00:04:29.120><c> now</c><00:04:29.600><c> is</c><00:04:29.840><c> that</c><00:04:30.320><c> we</c><00:04:30.560><c> can</c><00:04:30.800><c> sort</c><00:04:31.040><c> of</c>

00:04:31.830 --> 00:04:31.840 align:start position:0%
changed now is that we can sort of
 

00:04:31.840 --> 00:04:33.830 align:start position:0%
changed now is that we can sort of
engage<00:04:32.320><c> with</c><00:04:32.560><c> communities</c><00:04:33.360><c> that</c><00:04:33.520><c> will</c>

00:04:36.230 --> 00:04:36.240 align:start position:0%
actually like reinforce this idea
 

00:04:36.240 --> 00:04:37.909 align:start position:0%
actually like reinforce this idea
so<00:04:36.400><c> if</c><00:04:36.560><c> you</c><00:04:36.639><c> engage</c><00:04:36.960><c> with</c><00:04:37.120><c> a</c><00:04:37.199><c> community</c><00:04:37.680><c> where</c>

so if you engage with a community where

00:04:51.670 --> 00:04:51.680 align:start position:0%
maybe is actually changeable starts to
 

00:04:51.680 --> 00:04:53.430 align:start position:0%

00:05:27.110 --> 00:05:27.120 align:start position:0%

00:05:27.120 --> 00:05:28.870 align:start position:0%
and six and ten so there's this online
radicalization<00:05:27.919><c> effect</c><00:05:28.240><c> which</c><00:05:28.400><c> is</c><00:05:28.479><c> probably</c>

00:05:28.870 --> 00:05:28.880 align:start position:0%
radicalization effect which is probably
 

00:05:28.880 --> 00:05:30.390 align:start position:0%
radicalization effect which is probably
has<00:05:28.960><c> something</c><00:05:29.199><c> to</c><00:05:29.280><c> do</c><00:05:29.440><c> with</c><00:05:29.600><c> the</c><00:05:29.759><c> algorithms</c>

00:05:30.390 --> 00:05:30.400 align:start position:0%
has something to do with the algorithms
 

00:05:30.400 --> 00:05:31.909 align:start position:0%
has something to do with the algorithms
of<00:05:30.560><c> content</c><00:05:30.960><c> platforms</c>

00:05:31.909 --> 00:05:31.919 align:start position:0%
of content platforms
 

00:05:31.919 --> 00:05:33.510 align:start position:0%
of content platforms
so<00:05:32.080><c> it's</c><00:05:32.240><c> not</c><00:05:32.400><c> like</c><00:05:32.560><c> people</c><00:05:32.880><c> are</c><00:05:32.960><c> purposely</c>

00:05:33.510 --> 00:05:33.520 align:start position:0%
so it's not like people are purposely
 

00:05:33.520 --> 00:05:34.870 align:start position:0%
so it's not like people are purposely

00:05:36.230 --> 00:05:36.240 align:start position:0%

00:05:36.240 --> 00:05:38.070 align:start position:0%

00:05:38.070 --> 00:05:38.080 align:start position:0%

drift<00:05:38.560><c> so</c><00:05:38.720><c> you</c><00:05:38.880><c> start</c><00:05:39.199><c> out</c><00:05:39.360><c> with</c><00:05:39.520><c> sort</c><00:05:39.759><c> of</c><00:05:39.840><c> like</c>

00:05:40.150 --> 00:05:40.160 align:start position:0%
drift so you start out with sort of like
 

00:05:40.160 --> 00:05:43.189 align:start position:0%
drift so you start out with sort of like
the<00:05:40.479><c> gateway</c><00:05:40.960><c> drug</c><00:05:41.840><c> and</c><00:05:42.000><c> then</c><00:05:42.160><c> you</c><00:05:42.320><c> kind</c><00:05:42.479><c> of</c>

00:05:43.189 --> 00:05:43.199 align:start position:0%
the gateway drug and then you kind of
 

00:05:43.199 --> 00:05:45.270 align:start position:0%
the gateway drug and then you kind of
gradually<00:05:43.919><c> like</c><00:05:44.240><c> what</c><00:05:44.479><c> happens</c><00:05:44.880><c> is</c><00:05:45.039><c> these</c>

00:05:45.270 --> 00:05:45.280 align:start position:0%
gradually like what happens is these
 

00:05:45.280 --> 00:05:47.510 align:start position:0%
gradually like what happens is these
platforms<00:05:46.160><c> will</c><00:05:46.479><c> push</c><00:05:46.880><c> you</c>

00:05:47.510 --> 00:05:47.520 align:start position:0%
platforms will push you
 

00:05:47.520 --> 00:05:50.390 align:start position:0%
platforms will push you

00:05:50.390 --> 00:05:50.400 align:start position:0%
towards more radicalizing content so
 

00:05:50.400 --> 00:05:51.350 align:start position:0%
towards more radicalizing content so
this<00:05:50.560><c> is</c><00:05:50.720><c> why</c><00:05:50.880><c> you</c><00:05:51.039><c> see</c>

00:05:51.350 --> 00:05:51.360 align:start position:0%
this is why you see
 

00:05:51.360 --> 00:05:52.950 align:start position:0%
this is why you see
radicalization<00:05:52.160><c> in</c><00:05:52.240><c> general</c><00:05:52.560><c> amongst</c>

00:05:52.950 --> 00:05:52.960 align:start position:0%

00:05:54.720 --> 00:05:56.629 align:start position:0%

00:05:56.629 --> 00:05:56.639 align:start position:0%
so it has a really interesting effect on
 

00:05:56.639 --> 00:05:58.710 align:start position:0%
so it has a really interesting effect on

00:05:58.710 --> 00:05:58.720 align:start position:0%
your psychology
 

00:05:58.720 --> 00:06:01.270 align:start position:0%

00:06:01.270 --> 00:06:01.280 align:start position:0%
and so psychologically what starts to
 

00:06:01.280 --> 00:06:02.950 align:start position:0%
and so psychologically what starts to

00:06:02.950 --> 00:06:02.960 align:start position:0%
happen is your experience becomes
 

00:06:02.960 --> 00:06:04.469 align:start position:0%

00:07:53.749 --> 00:07:53.759 align:start position:0%
being an incel
 

00:07:53.759 --> 00:07:57.189 align:start position:0%
being an incel

00:07:57.189 --> 00:07:57.199 align:start position:0%
is getting laid or finding a partner
 

00:07:57.199 --> 00:07:59.510 align:start position:0%
is getting laid or finding a partner
and<00:07:57.360><c> so</c><00:07:57.599><c> then</c><00:07:57.919><c> you're</c><00:07:58.240><c> no</c><00:07:58.479><c> longer</c><00:07:58.800><c> an</c><00:07:58.960><c> insult</c>
