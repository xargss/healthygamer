00:06:28.469 --> 00:06:28.479 align:start position:0%
i think part of the problem is that
 

00:06:28.479 --> 00:06:30.309 align:start position:0%
i think part of the problem is that
therapists<00:06:29.120><c> are</c><00:06:29.280><c> afraid</c>

00:06:30.309 --> 00:06:30.319 align:start position:0%
therapists are afraid
 

00:06:30.319 --> 00:06:32.150 align:start position:0%

00:06:53.990 --> 00:06:54.000 align:start position:0%
that when you when you are a therapist
 

00:06:54.000 --> 00:06:55.749 align:start position:0%
that when you when you are a therapist

00:06:55.749 --> 00:06:55.759 align:start position:0%
and you go to supervision
 

00:06:55.759 --> 00:06:57.670 align:start position:0%
and you go to supervision
very<00:06:56.080><c> few</c><00:06:56.319><c> therapists</c><00:06:56.800><c> will</c><00:06:56.960><c> say</c><00:06:57.120><c> like</c><00:06:57.360><c> maybe</c>

00:06:57.670 --> 00:06:57.680 align:start position:0%
very few therapists will say like maybe
 

00:06:57.680 --> 00:06:58.950 align:start position:0%
very few therapists will say like maybe
you<00:06:57.840><c> could</c><00:06:58.000><c> have</c><00:06:58.080><c> done</c><00:06:58.319><c> something</c><00:06:58.639><c> better</c>

00:06:58.950 --> 00:06:58.960 align:start position:0%
you could have done something better
 

00:06:58.960 --> 00:07:00.629 align:start position:0%
you could have done something better
like<00:06:59.199><c> most</c><00:06:59.520><c> of</c><00:06:59.599><c> the</c><00:06:59.680><c> time</c><00:07:00.000><c> it's</c><00:07:00.160><c> the</c><00:07:00.319><c> sort</c><00:07:00.560><c> of</c>

00:07:00.629 --> 00:07:00.639 align:start position:0%
like most of the time it's the sort of
 

00:07:00.639 --> 00:07:01.430 align:start position:0%
like most of the time it's the sort of
thing<00:07:00.800><c> where</c><00:07:01.039><c> like</c>

00:07:01.430 --> 00:07:01.440 align:start position:0%
thing where like
 

00:07:01.440 --> 00:07:03.510 align:start position:0%
thing where like
you<00:07:01.599><c> know</c><00:07:01.680><c> the</c><00:07:01.840><c> patient</c><00:07:02.400><c> really</c><00:07:02.800><c> couldn't</c>

00:07:03.510 --> 00:07:03.520 align:start position:0%
you know the patient really couldn't
 

00:07:03.520 --> 00:07:05.270 align:start position:0%
you know the patient really couldn't
wasn't<00:07:03.919><c> ready</c><00:07:04.240><c> yet</c>

00:07:05.270 --> 00:07:05.280 align:start position:0%
wasn't ready yet
 

00:07:05.280 --> 00:07:07.110 align:start position:0%
wasn't ready yet
so<00:07:05.440><c> we</c><00:07:05.599><c> have</c><00:07:05.919><c> all</c><00:07:06.160><c> these</c><00:07:06.400><c> kinds</c><00:07:06.720><c> of</c><00:07:06.800><c> things</c>

00:07:07.110 --> 00:07:07.120 align:start position:0%
so we have all these kinds of things
 

00:07:07.120 --> 00:07:08.550 align:start position:0%
so we have all these kinds of things
that<00:07:07.280><c> we</c><00:07:07.440><c> sort</c><00:07:07.680><c> of</c><00:07:07.759><c> tell</c><00:07:08.000><c> ourselves</c><00:07:08.400><c> as</c>

00:07:08.550 --> 00:07:08.560 align:start position:0%
that we sort of tell ourselves as
 

00:07:08.560 --> 00:07:09.270 align:start position:0%
that we sort of tell ourselves as
therapists

00:07:09.270 --> 00:07:09.280 align:start position:0%
therapists
 

00:07:09.280 --> 00:07:12.550 align:start position:0%
therapists
that<00:07:09.759><c> sort</c><00:07:10.000><c> of</c><00:07:10.080><c> make</c><00:07:10.319><c> it</c><00:07:10.479><c> like</c><00:07:10.720><c> not</c><00:07:10.960><c> our</c><00:07:11.120><c> fault</c>

00:07:12.550 --> 00:07:12.560 align:start position:0%
that sort of make it like not our fault
 

00:07:12.560 --> 00:07:14.309 align:start position:0%
that sort of make it like not our fault
and<00:07:12.720><c> so</c><00:07:12.960><c> this</c><00:07:13.120><c> is</c><00:07:13.280><c> where</c><00:07:13.599><c> part</c><00:07:13.840><c> of</c><00:07:13.919><c> the</c><00:07:14.000><c> reason</c>

00:07:14.309 --> 00:07:14.319 align:start position:0%
and so this is where part of the reason
 

00:07:14.319 --> 00:07:16.710 align:start position:0%
and so this is where part of the reason
that<00:07:14.560><c> we</c><00:07:14.720><c> kind</c><00:07:14.880><c> of</c><00:07:15.120><c> have</c><00:07:15.520><c> a</c>

00:07:16.710 --> 00:07:16.720 align:start position:0%
that we kind of have a
 

00:07:16.720 --> 00:07:19.189 align:start position:0%
that we kind of have a
um<00:07:17.680><c> and</c><00:07:17.919><c> i</c><00:07:18.000><c> think</c><00:07:18.160><c> that</c><00:07:18.240><c> that</c><00:07:18.639><c> that</c><00:07:18.880><c> approach</c>

00:07:19.189 --> 00:07:19.199 align:start position:0%
um and i think that that that approach
 

00:07:19.199 --> 00:07:21.110 align:start position:0%
um and i think that that that approach
is<00:07:19.360><c> useful</c><00:07:19.759><c> okay</c><00:07:20.000><c> so</c><00:07:20.160><c> for</c><00:07:20.400><c> the</c><00:07:20.479><c> record</c><00:07:20.880><c> like</c><00:07:21.039><c> i</c>

00:07:21.110 --> 00:07:21.120 align:start position:0%
is useful okay so for the record like i
 

00:07:21.120 --> 00:07:22.469 align:start position:0%
is useful okay so for the record like i
think<00:07:21.199><c> that</c><00:07:21.440><c> therapy</c><00:07:21.759><c> is</c><00:07:21.840><c> really</c><00:07:22.000><c> good</c><00:07:22.240><c> like</c><00:07:22.400><c> i</c>

00:07:22.469 --> 00:07:22.479 align:start position:0%
think that therapy is really good like i
 

00:07:22.479 --> 00:07:24.150 align:start position:0%
think that therapy is really good like i
do<00:07:22.639><c> that</c><00:07:22.960><c> a</c><00:07:23.039><c> lot</c><00:07:23.280><c> you</c><00:07:23.440><c> know</c><00:07:23.520><c> i</c><00:07:23.680><c> bring</c><00:07:23.919><c> things</c>

00:07:24.150 --> 00:07:24.160 align:start position:0%
do that a lot you know i bring things
 

00:07:24.160 --> 00:07:25.589 align:start position:0%
do that a lot you know i bring things
out<00:07:24.319><c> of</c><00:07:24.400><c> people</c>

00:07:25.589 --> 00:07:25.599 align:start position:0%
out of people
 

00:07:25.599 --> 00:07:28.550 align:start position:0%
out of people
um<00:07:26.560><c> it's</c><00:07:27.039><c> useful</c><00:07:27.520><c> but</c><00:07:27.680><c> i</c><00:07:27.759><c> think</c><00:07:28.080><c> it</c><00:07:28.160><c> doesn't</c>

00:07:28.550 --> 00:07:28.560 align:start position:0%
um it's useful but i think it doesn't
 

00:07:28.560 --> 00:07:30.150 align:start position:0%
um it's useful but i think it doesn't
work<00:07:28.800><c> for</c><00:07:29.039><c> everyone</c><00:07:29.520><c> and</c><00:07:29.599><c> this</c><00:07:29.759><c> is</c><00:07:29.919><c> why</c><00:07:30.080><c> i</c>

00:07:30.150 --> 00:07:30.160 align:start position:0%
work for everyone and this is why i
 

00:07:30.160 --> 00:07:32.550 align:start position:0%
work for everyone and this is why i
think<00:07:30.400><c> coaching</c><00:07:30.800><c> has</c><00:07:30.960><c> emerged</c>

00:07:32.550 --> 00:07:32.560 align:start position:0%
think coaching has emerged
 

00:07:32.560 --> 00:07:34.870 align:start position:0%
think coaching has emerged
as<00:07:32.880><c> like</c><00:07:33.120><c> a</c><00:07:33.280><c> field</c><00:07:33.759><c> and</c><00:07:33.919><c> why</c><00:07:34.160><c> people</c><00:07:34.560><c> are</c><00:07:34.639><c> so</c>

00:07:34.870 --> 00:07:34.880 align:start position:0%
as like a field and why people are so
 

00:07:34.880 --> 00:07:35.909 align:start position:0%
as like a field and why people are so
interested<00:07:35.280><c> in</c><00:07:35.440><c> it</c>

00:07:35.909 --> 00:07:35.919 align:start position:0%
interested in it
 

00:07:35.919 --> 00:07:37.670 align:start position:0%
interested in it
because<00:07:36.240><c> coaches</c><00:07:36.720><c> are</c><00:07:36.880><c> better</c><00:07:37.199><c> at</c><00:07:37.360><c> like</c>

00:07:37.670 --> 00:07:37.680 align:start position:0%
because coaches are better at like

00:10:14.470 --> 00:10:14.480 align:start position:0%
so this is where like i think it's crazy
 

00:10:14.480 --> 00:10:15.430 align:start position:0%
so this is where like i think it's crazy
because<00:10:14.800><c> i</c><00:10:14.959><c> is</c><00:10:15.200><c> a</c>

00:10:15.430 --> 00:10:15.440 align:start position:0%
because i is a

00:10:17.430 --> 00:10:17.440 align:start position:0%
as a profession i think therapists like
 

00:10:17.440 --> 00:10:19.190 align:start position:0%
as a profession i think therapists like
this<00:10:17.600><c> is</c><00:10:17.680><c> just</c><00:10:17.839><c> my</c><00:10:18.079><c> opinion</c><00:10:18.480><c> okay</c><00:10:18.720><c> like</c><00:10:18.880><c> maybe</c>

00:10:19.190 --> 00:10:19.200 align:start position:0%
this is just my opinion okay like maybe
 

00:10:19.200 --> 00:10:20.389 align:start position:0%
this is just my opinion okay like maybe
people<00:10:19.440><c> disagree</c><00:10:20.000><c> but</c>

00:10:20.389 --> 00:10:20.399 align:start position:0%
people disagree but
 

00:10:20.399 --> 00:10:22.230 align:start position:0%
people disagree but
i'm<00:10:20.560><c> sure</c><00:10:20.800><c> people</c><00:10:21.040><c> disagree</c><00:10:21.760><c> but</c><00:10:22.000><c> i</c><00:10:22.079><c> think</c>

00:10:22.230 --> 00:10:22.240 align:start position:0%
i'm sure people disagree but i think
 

00:10:22.240 --> 00:10:24.389 align:start position:0%
i'm sure people disagree but i think
like<00:10:22.560><c> as</c><00:10:22.800><c> a</c><00:10:22.880><c> profession</c><00:10:23.440><c> we're</c><00:10:23.680><c> trained</c><00:10:24.160><c> to</c>

00:10:24.389 --> 00:10:24.399 align:start position:0%
like as a profession we're trained to
 

00:10:24.399 --> 00:10:27.110 align:start position:0%
like as a profession we're trained to
not<00:10:24.720><c> take</c><00:10:24.959><c> responsibility</c><00:10:25.760><c> for</c><00:10:26.000><c> our</c><00:10:26.079><c> patients</c>

00:10:27.110 --> 00:10:27.120 align:start position:0%
not take responsibility for our patients
 

00:10:27.120 --> 00:10:28.550 align:start position:0%
not take responsibility for our patients
right<00:10:27.279><c> and</c><00:10:27.360><c> it</c><00:10:27.519><c> sort</c><00:10:27.680><c> of</c><00:10:27.760><c> makes</c><00:10:28.000><c> sense</c><00:10:28.320><c> like</c><00:10:28.480><c> if</c>

00:10:28.550 --> 00:10:28.560 align:start position:0%
right and it sort of makes sense like if
 

00:10:28.560 --> 00:10:29.509 align:start position:0%
right and it sort of makes sense like if
you're<00:10:28.720><c> working</c><00:10:29.040><c> with</c><00:10:29.120><c> someone</c><00:10:29.360><c> who's</c>

00:10:29.509 --> 00:10:29.519 align:start position:0%
you're working with someone who's
 

00:10:29.519 --> 00:10:31.430 align:start position:0%
you're working with someone who's
suicidal<00:10:30.160><c> you</c><00:10:30.320><c> can't</c><00:10:30.560><c> really</c><00:10:30.880><c> like</c>

00:10:31.430 --> 00:10:31.440 align:start position:0%
suicidal you can't really like
 

00:10:31.440 --> 00:10:33.030 align:start position:0%
suicidal you can't really like
ultimately<00:10:31.839><c> it's</c><00:10:32.000><c> that</c><00:10:32.320><c> it's</c><00:10:32.480><c> gonna</c><00:10:32.640><c> be</c><00:10:32.720><c> their</c>

00:10:33.030 --> 00:10:33.040 align:start position:0%
ultimately it's that it's gonna be their
 

00:10:33.040 --> 00:10:34.470 align:start position:0%
ultimately it's that it's gonna be their
choice<00:10:33.360><c> like</c><00:10:33.519><c> whether</c><00:10:33.760><c> they</c><00:10:33.839><c> kill</c><00:10:34.079><c> themselves</c>

00:10:34.470 --> 00:10:34.480 align:start position:0%
choice like whether they kill themselves
 

00:10:34.480 --> 00:10:36.150 align:start position:0%
choice like whether they kill themselves
or<00:10:34.560><c> not</c><00:10:34.800><c> you</c><00:10:34.959><c> can't</c><00:10:35.279><c> make</c><00:10:35.519><c> them</c><00:10:35.680><c> do</c><00:10:35.839><c> anything</c>

00:10:36.150 --> 00:10:36.160 align:start position:0%
or not you can't make them do anything
 

00:10:36.160 --> 00:10:36.790 align:start position:0%
or not you can't make them do anything
you<00:10:36.320><c> can't</c>

00:10:36.790 --> 00:10:36.800 align:start position:0%
you can't
 

00:10:36.800 --> 00:10:38.230 align:start position:0%
you can't
control<00:10:37.200><c> another</c><00:10:37.519><c> human</c><00:10:37.760><c> being</c><00:10:38.000><c> so</c><00:10:38.079><c> i</c>

00:10:38.230 --> 00:10:38.240 align:start position:0%
control another human being so i
 

00:10:38.240 --> 00:10:39.829 align:start position:0%
control another human being so i
understand<00:10:39.040><c> where</c><00:10:39.279><c> that</c><00:10:39.519><c> lack</c><00:10:39.760><c> of</c>

00:10:39.829 --> 00:10:39.839 align:start position:0%
understand where that lack of
 

00:10:39.839 --> 00:10:41.990 align:start position:0%
understand where that lack of
responsibility<00:10:40.640><c> comes</c><00:10:40.880><c> from</c>

00:10:41.990 --> 00:10:42.000 align:start position:0%
responsibility comes from
 

00:10:42.000 --> 00:10:43.670 align:start position:0%
responsibility comes from
but<00:10:42.240><c> there's</c><00:10:42.480><c> also</c><00:10:42.800><c> like</c><00:10:42.959><c> a</c><00:10:43.279><c> lack</c><00:10:43.519><c> of</c>

00:10:43.670 --> 00:10:43.680 align:start position:0%
but there's also like a lack of
 

00:10:43.680 --> 00:10:45.829 align:start position:0%
but there's also like a lack of
responsibility<00:10:44.880><c> right</c><00:10:45.120><c> which</c><00:10:45.360><c> is</c><00:10:45.440><c> kind</c><00:10:45.600><c> of</c>

00:10:45.829 --> 00:10:45.839 align:start position:0%
responsibility right which is kind of
 

00:10:45.839 --> 00:10:46.790 align:start position:0%
responsibility right which is kind of
weird

00:10:46.790 --> 00:10:46.800 align:start position:0%
weird
 

00:10:46.800 --> 00:10:49.350 align:start position:0%
weird
and<00:10:46.959><c> so</c><00:10:47.120><c> this</c><00:10:47.360><c> is</c><00:10:47.440><c> where</c><00:10:47.680><c> like</c><00:10:48.959><c> you</c><00:10:49.040><c> know</c><00:10:49.200><c> i</c>

00:10:49.350 --> 00:10:49.360 align:start position:0%
and so this is where like you know i
 

00:10:49.360 --> 00:10:51.829 align:start position:0%
and so this is where like you know i
think<00:10:49.519><c> that</c>

00:10:51.829 --> 00:10:51.839 align:start position:0%
 
 

00:10:51.839 --> 00:10:53.509 align:start position:0%
 
this<00:10:52.079><c> needs</c><00:10:52.320><c> to</c><00:10:52.480><c> change</c><00:10:52.800><c> and</c><00:10:52.959><c> i</c><00:10:53.040><c> think</c><00:10:53.200><c> this</c><00:10:53.360><c> is</c>

00:10:53.509 --> 00:10:53.519 align:start position:0%
this needs to change and i think this is
 

00:10:53.519 --> 00:10:55.910 align:start position:0%
this needs to change and i think this is
why<00:10:53.760><c> coaching</c><00:10:54.160><c> is</c><00:10:54.560><c> is</c><00:10:54.800><c> growing</c><00:10:55.279><c> so</c><00:10:55.519><c> much</c><00:10:55.760><c> is</c>

00:10:55.910 --> 00:10:55.920 align:start position:0%
why coaching is is growing so much is
