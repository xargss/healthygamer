i'm thinking about killing myself and i
 

00:01:03.520 --> 00:01:05.350 align:start position:0%
i'm thinking about killing myself and i
still<00:01:03.840><c> may</c><00:01:04.000><c> not</c><00:01:04.239><c> hospitalize</c><00:01:04.720><c> them</c><00:01:04.879><c> in</c><00:01:05.040><c> fact</c><00:01:05.199><c> i</c>

00:01:05.350 --> 00:01:05.360 align:start position:0%
still may not hospitalize them in fact i
 

00:01:05.360 --> 00:01:06.710 align:start position:0%
still may not hospitalize them in fact i
usually<00:01:05.680><c> don't</c>

00:01:06.710 --> 00:01:06.720 align:start position:0%
usually don't
 

00:01:06.720 --> 00:01:08.870 align:start position:0%
usually don't
so<00:01:07.040><c> the</c><00:01:07.200><c> main</c><00:01:07.600><c> issue</c><00:01:08.000><c> is</c><00:01:08.080><c> whether</c><00:01:08.400><c> there</c><00:01:08.560><c> is</c><00:01:08.720><c> an</c>

00:01:08.870 --> 00:01:08.880 align:start position:0%
so the main issue is whether there is an
 

00:01:08.880 --> 00:01:10.710 align:start position:0%
so the main issue is whether there is an
acute<00:01:09.680><c> elevation</c>

00:01:10.710 --> 00:01:10.720 align:start position:0%
acute elevation
 

00:01:10.720 --> 00:01:13.990 align:start position:0%
acute elevation
a<00:01:10.960><c> temporary</c><00:01:11.760><c> elevation</c><00:01:12.960><c> of</c><00:01:13.119><c> your</c><00:01:13.280><c> risk</c><00:01:13.760><c> that</c>

00:01:13.990 --> 00:01:14.000 align:start position:0%
a temporary elevation of your risk that
 

00:01:14.000 --> 00:01:16.550 align:start position:0%
a temporary elevation of your risk that
is<00:01:14.080><c> very</c><00:01:14.400><c> problematic</c><00:01:15.200><c> in</c><00:01:15.360><c> that</c><00:01:15.520><c> moment</c>

00:01:16.550 --> 00:01:16.560 align:start position:0%
is very problematic in that moment
 

00:01:16.560 --> 00:01:18.870 align:start position:0%
is very problematic in that moment
and<00:01:16.799><c> if</c><00:01:17.040><c> the</c><00:01:17.200><c> answer</c><00:01:17.520><c> to</c><00:01:17.680><c> that</c><00:01:17.920><c> question</c><00:01:18.560><c> is</c>

00:01:18.870 --> 00:01:18.880 align:start position:0%
and if the answer to that question is
 

00:01:18.880 --> 00:01:19.910 align:start position:0%
and if the answer to that question is
yes

00:01:19.910 --> 00:01:19.920 align:start position:0%
yes
 

00:01:19.920 --> 00:01:21.990 align:start position:0%
yes
then<00:01:20.240><c> we</c><00:01:20.400><c> will</c><00:01:20.640><c> consider</c><00:01:21.360><c> involuntary</c>

00:01:21.990 --> 00:01:22.000 align:start position:0%
then we will consider involuntary
 

00:01:22.000 --> 00:01:23.109 align:start position:0%
then we will consider involuntary
hospitalization<00:01:22.640><c> or</c><00:01:22.720><c> at</c><00:01:22.720><c> least</c><00:01:22.880><c> me</c>

00:01:23.109 --> 00:01:23.119 align:start position:0%
hospitalization or at least me
 

00:01:23.119 --> 00:01:24.550 align:start position:0%
hospitalization or at least me
personally

00:01:24.550 --> 00:01:24.560 align:start position:0%
personally
 

00:01:24.560 --> 00:01:26.469 align:start position:0%
personally
so<00:01:24.880><c> that's</c><00:01:25.200><c> also</c><00:01:25.439><c> where</c><00:01:25.600><c> i</c><00:01:25.759><c> would</c><00:01:25.920><c> think</c><00:01:26.080><c> about</c>

00:01:26.469 --> 00:01:26.479 align:start position:0%
so that's also where i would think about
 

00:01:26.479 --> 00:01:28.789 align:start position:0%
so that's also where i would think about
voluntary<00:01:27.040><c> hospitalization</c><00:01:27.840><c> so</c><00:01:28.080><c> most</c><00:01:28.479><c> of</c><00:01:28.560><c> the</c>

00:01:28.789 --> 00:01:28.799 align:start position:0%
voluntary hospitalization so most of the
 

00:01:28.799 --> 00:01:30.469 align:start position:0%

00:01:30.469 --> 00:01:30.479 align:start position:0%
people that i've worked with like will
 

00:01:30.479 --> 00:01:32.870 align:start position:0%
people that i've worked with like will

i think maybe sixty percent is made
 

00:06:33.120 --> 00:06:36.629 align:start position:0%
i think maybe sixty percent is made
within<00:06:33.759><c> 60</c><00:06:34.080><c> to</c><00:06:34.240><c> 120</c><00:06:34.880><c> seconds</c><00:06:35.280><c> of</c><00:06:35.360><c> the</c><00:06:35.520><c> attempt</c>

00:12:33.030 --> 00:12:33.040 align:start position:0%

00:12:33.760 --> 00:12:36.629 align:start position:0%

so<00:12:33.920><c> as</c><00:12:34.000><c> soon</c><00:12:34.240><c> as</c><00:12:34.320><c> shallow</c><00:12:34.639><c> grave</c><00:12:35.120><c> ends</c><00:12:36.320><c> if</c><00:12:36.480><c> they</c>

00:12:36.629 --> 00:12:36.639 align:start position:0%
so as soon as shallow grave ends if they
 

00:12:36.639 --> 00:12:36.949 align:start position:0%
so as soon as shallow grave ends if they
take

00:12:36.949 --> 00:12:36.959 align:start position:0%
take
 

00:12:36.959 --> 00:12:39.590 align:start position:0%
take

00:12:39.590 --> 00:12:39.600 align:start position:0%
you know any damage they could still die
 

00:12:39.600 --> 00:12:41.190 align:start position:0%
you know any damage they could still die
so<00:12:39.760><c> what</c><00:12:39.920><c> i</c><00:12:40.000><c> think</c><00:12:40.160><c> about</c><00:12:40.320><c> a</c><00:12:40.399><c> hospitalization</c>

00:12:41.190 --> 00:12:41.200 align:start position:0%
so what i think about a hospitalization
 

00:12:41.200 --> 00:12:42.629 align:start position:0%
so what i think about a hospitalization

00:12:42.629 --> 00:12:42.639 align:start position:0%
is sort of like a shallow grave so it's
 

00:12:42.639 --> 00:12:44.550 align:start position:0%
is sort of like a shallow grave so it's
like<00:12:42.800><c> a</c><00:12:42.880><c> temporary</c><00:12:43.519><c> measure</c><00:12:43.920><c> that</c><00:12:44.079><c> keeps</c><00:12:44.399><c> you</c>

00:12:44.550 --> 00:12:44.560 align:start position:0%
like a temporary measure that keeps you
 

00:12:44.560 --> 00:12:45.350 align:start position:0%
like a temporary measure that keeps you

00:12:45.350 --> 00:12:45.360 align:start position:0%

00:12:45.360 --> 00:12:47.990 align:start position:0%

00:12:47.990 --> 00:12:48.000 align:start position:0%
but in my experience hospitalization can
 

00:12:48.000 --> 00:12:49.670 align:start position:0%
but in my experience hospitalization can
sometimes<00:12:48.560><c> fix</c><00:12:48.880><c> things</c>

00:12:49.670 --> 00:12:49.680 align:start position:0%
sometimes fix things
 

00:12:49.680 --> 00:12:51.750 align:start position:0%
sometimes fix things
but<00:12:49.839><c> it's</c><00:12:50.079><c> really</c><00:12:50.399><c> about</c><00:12:50.720><c> like</c><00:12:51.200><c> healing</c><00:12:51.519><c> you</c>

00:12:51.750 --> 00:12:51.760 align:start position:0%
