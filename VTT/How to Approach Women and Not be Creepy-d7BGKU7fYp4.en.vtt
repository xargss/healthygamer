00:02:35.789 --> 00:02:35.799 align:start position:0%
way there's there's no simple answer
 

00:02:35.799 --> 00:02:37.680 align:start position:0%
way there's there's no simple answer
there<00:02:36.250><c> except</c><00:02:36.639><c> that</c><00:02:36.819><c> it's</c><00:02:36.970><c> a</c><00:02:37.090><c> balance</c><00:02:37.480><c> between</c>

00:02:37.680 --> 00:02:37.690 align:start position:0%

there except that it's a balance between
