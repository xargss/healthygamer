it's kind of organized is sort of like
what

00:00:15.110 --> 00:00:15.120 align:start position:0%
what
 

00:00:15.120 --> 00:00:17.029 align:start position:0%
what
i<00:00:15.280><c> think</c><00:00:15.440><c> about</c><00:00:15.839><c> what</c><00:00:16.000><c> i</c><00:00:16.160><c> do</c><00:00:16.400><c> with</c><00:00:16.640><c> actual</c>

00:00:17.029 --> 00:00:17.039 align:start position:0%
i think about what i do with actual
 

00:00:17.039 --> 00:00:19.349 align:start position:0%
i think about what i do with actual
clients<00:00:18.000><c> and</c><00:00:18.160><c> what</c><00:00:18.400><c> i</c><00:00:18.480><c> do</c><00:00:18.640><c> with</c><00:00:18.800><c> clients</c><00:00:19.199><c> is</c>

00:00:19.349 --> 00:00:19.359 align:start position:0%
clients and what i do with clients is
 

00:00:19.359 --> 00:00:20.950 align:start position:0%
clients and what i do with clients is
not<00:00:19.520><c> like</c><00:00:19.760><c> you</c><00:00:19.840><c> know</c><00:00:20.000><c> one</c><00:00:20.240><c> size</c><00:00:20.560><c> fits</c><00:00:20.800><c> all</c>

00:00:20.950 --> 00:00:20.960 align:start position:0%
not like you know one size fits all
 

00:00:20.960 --> 00:00:22.630 align:start position:0%
not like you know one size fits all
solution<00:00:21.439><c> it's</c><00:00:21.520><c> sort</c><00:00:21.680><c> of</c><00:00:21.760><c> like</c><00:00:21.920><c> a</c><00:00:22.000><c> branching</c>

00:00:22.630 --> 00:00:22.640 align:start position:0%
solution it's sort of like a branching
 

00:00:22.640 --> 00:00:23.189 align:start position:0%
solution it's sort of like a branching
logic

00:00:23.189 --> 00:00:23.199 align:start position:0%
logic
 

00:00:23.199 --> 00:00:24.790 align:start position:0%
logic
and<00:00:23.279><c> so</c><00:00:23.600><c> the</c><00:00:23.760><c> goal</c><00:00:24.000><c> of</c><00:00:24.080><c> the</c><00:00:24.160><c> guides</c><00:00:24.560><c> is</c><00:00:24.640><c> to</c>

00:00:24.790 --> 00:00:24.800 align:start position:0%
and so the goal of the guides is to
 

00:00:24.800 --> 00:00:26.230 align:start position:0%
and so the goal of the guides is to
actually<00:00:25.199><c> like</c><00:00:25.359><c> kind</c><00:00:25.519><c> of</c><00:00:25.680><c> walk</c><00:00:26.000><c> that</c>

00:00:26.230 --> 00:00:26.240 align:start position:0%
actually like kind of walk that
 

00:00:26.240 --> 00:00:28.150 align:start position:0%
actually like kind of walk that
branching<00:00:26.720><c> journey</c><00:00:27.119><c> that</c><00:00:27.359><c> you</c><00:00:27.519><c> sort</c><00:00:27.760><c> of</c><00:00:27.920><c> pick</c>

00:00:28.150 --> 00:00:28.160 align:start position:0%
branching journey that you sort of pick
 

00:00:28.160 --> 00:00:29.750 align:start position:0%
branching journey that you sort of pick
at<00:00:28.320><c> each</c><00:00:28.480><c> of</c><00:00:28.640><c> the</c><00:00:28.720><c> branch</c><00:00:29.039><c> points</c><00:00:29.359><c> like</c><00:00:29.599><c> what</c>

00:00:29.750 --> 00:00:29.760 align:start position:0%
at each of the branch points like what
 

00:00:29.760 --> 00:00:30.470 align:start position:0%
at each of the branch points like what
you<00:00:29.920><c> want</c><00:00:30.080><c> to</c><00:00:30.160><c> do</c>

00:00:30.470 --> 00:00:30.480 align:start position:0%
you want to do

we're raised in a particular way and it
 

00:01:04.479 --> 00:01:05.750 align:start position:0%
we're raised in a particular way and it
tends<00:01:04.720><c> to</c><00:01:04.879><c> create</c><00:01:05.119><c> problems</c><00:01:05.519><c> in</c><00:01:05.680><c> our</c>

00:05:38.150 --> 00:05:38.160 align:start position:0%
happens a little while later is
 

00:05:38.160 --> 00:05:40.629 align:start position:0%
happens a little while later is
mom<00:05:38.479><c> usually</c><00:05:39.039><c> comes</c><00:05:39.360><c> back</c><00:05:39.600><c> into</c><00:05:39.840><c> the</c><00:05:39.919><c> room</c><00:05:40.400><c> and</c>

00:05:40.629 --> 00:05:40.639 align:start position:0%
mom usually comes back into the room and
 

00:05:40.639 --> 00:05:42.390 align:start position:0%
mom usually comes back into the room and

00:05:42.390 --> 00:05:42.400 align:start position:0%
is is kind of back
 

00:05:42.400 --> 00:05:44.790 align:start position:0%
is is kind of back
and<00:05:42.560><c> so</c><00:05:42.800><c> what</c><00:05:43.120><c> bowelbee</c><00:05:43.600><c> kind</c><00:05:43.759><c> of</c><00:05:43.919><c> noticed</c><00:05:44.560><c> is</c>

00:05:44.790 --> 00:05:44.800 align:start position:0%
and so what bowelbee kind of noticed is
 

00:05:44.800 --> 00:05:46.070 align:start position:0%
and so what bowelbee kind of noticed is
that<00:05:45.120><c> um</c>

00:05:46.070 --> 00:05:46.080 align:start position:0%
that um
 

00:05:46.080 --> 00:05:47.830 align:start position:0%
that um
there<00:05:46.479><c> are</c><00:05:46.800><c> actually</c><00:05:47.120><c> like</c><00:05:47.360><c> a</c><00:05:47.440><c> lot</c><00:05:47.680><c> of</c>

00:05:47.830 --> 00:05:47.840 align:start position:0%
there are actually like a lot of
 

00:05:47.840 --> 00:05:50.070 align:start position:0%
there are actually like a lot of
different<00:05:48.320><c> ways</c><00:05:48.720><c> that</c><00:05:48.880><c> the</c><00:05:49.120><c> child</c><00:05:49.600><c> actually</c>

00:05:50.070 --> 00:05:50.080 align:start position:0%
different ways that the child actually
 

00:05:50.080 --> 00:05:52.070 align:start position:0%
different ways that the child actually
responds<00:05:50.560><c> to</c><00:05:50.639><c> this</c><00:05:50.840><c> situation</c>

00:05:52.070 --> 00:05:52.080 align:start position:0%
responds to this situation
 

00:05:52.080 --> 00:05:53.990 align:start position:0%
responds to this situation
and<00:05:52.320><c> so</c><00:05:52.880><c> over</c><00:05:53.199><c> time</c><00:05:53.360><c> there</c><00:05:53.520><c> were</c><00:05:53.759><c> other</c>

00:05:53.990 --> 00:05:54.000 align:start position:0%
and so over time there were other
 

00:05:54.000 --> 00:05:55.670 align:start position:0%
and so over time there were other
researchers<00:05:54.560><c> who</c><00:05:54.720><c> kind</c><00:05:54.880><c> of</c><00:05:54.960><c> contributed</c><00:05:55.520><c> to</c>

00:05:55.670 --> 00:05:55.680 align:start position:0%
researchers who kind of contributed to
 

00:05:55.680 --> 00:05:56.469 align:start position:0%
researchers who kind of contributed to
this<00:05:55.919><c> work</c>

00:05:56.469 --> 00:05:56.479 align:start position:0%
this work
 

00:05:56.479 --> 00:05:59.189 align:start position:0%
this work
work<00:05:57.039><c> and</c><00:05:57.199><c> eventually</c><00:05:58.240><c> they</c><00:05:58.400><c> sort</c><00:05:58.560><c> of</c><00:05:58.720><c> came</c><00:05:59.039><c> up</c>

00:05:59.189 --> 00:05:59.199 align:start position:0%
work and eventually they sort of came up
 

00:05:59.199 --> 00:05:59.749 align:start position:0%
work and eventually they sort of came up
with

00:05:59.749 --> 00:05:59.759 align:start position:0%
with
 

00:05:59.759 --> 00:06:02.790 align:start position:0%
with
four<00:06:00.080><c> kinds</c><00:06:00.479><c> of</c><00:06:00.560><c> what</c><00:06:00.720><c> we</c><00:06:00.880><c> call</c><00:06:01.199><c> attachment</c>

00:06:02.790 --> 00:06:02.800 align:start position:0%
four kinds of what we call attachment
 

00:06:02.800 --> 00:06:04.390 align:start position:0%
four kinds of what we call attachment
so<00:06:03.039><c> the</c><00:06:03.199><c> first</c><00:06:03.440><c> kind</c><00:06:03.600><c> of</c><00:06:03.759><c> attachment</c><00:06:04.319><c> is</c>

00:06:04.390 --> 00:06:04.400 align:start position:0%
so the first kind of attachment is
 

00:06:04.400 --> 00:06:06.230 align:start position:0%
so the first kind of attachment is
something<00:06:04.639><c> called</c><00:06:04.960><c> secure</c><00:06:05.360><c> attachment</c>

00:06:06.230 --> 00:06:06.240 align:start position:0%
something called secure attachment
 

00:06:06.240 --> 00:06:07.909 align:start position:0%
something called secure attachment
so<00:06:06.400><c> what</c><00:06:06.560><c> happens</c><00:06:06.960><c> in</c><00:06:07.039><c> this</c><00:06:07.280><c> case</c><00:06:07.680><c> is</c><00:06:07.759><c> the</c>

00:06:07.909 --> 00:06:07.919 align:start position:0%
so what happens in this case is the
 

00:06:07.919 --> 00:06:09.350 align:start position:0%
so what happens in this case is the
parent<00:06:08.240><c> leaves</c><00:06:08.479><c> the</c><00:06:08.639><c> room</c><00:06:09.120><c> an</c>

00:06:09.350 --> 00:06:09.360 align:start position:0%
parent leaves the room an

00:06:13.430 --> 00:06:13.440 align:start position:0%
insecure in secure attachment
 

00:06:13.440 --> 00:06:15.270 align:start position:0%
insecure in secure attachment
the<00:06:13.680><c> child</c><00:06:14.080><c> may</c><00:06:14.319><c> start</c><00:06:14.560><c> to</c><00:06:14.639><c> cry</c><00:06:15.039><c> when</c><00:06:15.199><c> the</c>

00:06:15.270 --> 00:06:15.280 align:start position:0%
the child may start to cry when the
 

00:06:15.280 --> 00:06:18.469 align:start position:0%
the child may start to cry when the
stranger<00:06:15.759><c> enters</c><00:06:16.400><c> so</c><00:06:16.560><c> they'll</c><00:06:16.800><c> cry</c>

00:06:18.469 --> 00:06:18.479 align:start position:0%
stranger enters so they'll cry
 

00:06:18.479 --> 00:06:21.270 align:start position:0%
stranger enters so they'll cry
but<00:06:19.039><c> when</c><00:06:19.440><c> mom</c><00:06:19.759><c> comes</c><00:06:20.080><c> back</c><00:06:20.479><c> they</c><00:06:20.639><c> are</c><00:06:20.880><c> easily</c>

00:06:21.270 --> 00:06:21.280 align:start position:0%
but when mom comes back they are easily
 

00:06:21.280 --> 00:06:22.309 align:start position:0%
but when mom comes back they are easily
comforted

00:06:22.309 --> 00:06:22.319 align:start position:0%
comforted
 

00:06:22.319 --> 00:06:23.990 align:start position:0%

and so what that sort of results in is
 

00:09:34.720 --> 00:09:36.790 align:start position:0%
and so what that sort of results in is
kind<00:09:34.880><c> of</c><00:09:34.959><c> this</c><00:09:35.120><c> like</c><00:09:35.360><c> clinical</c><00:09:35.920><c> presentation</c>

00:09:36.790 --> 00:09:36.800 align:start position:0%
kind of this like clinical presentation
 

00:09:36.800 --> 00:09:39.190 align:start position:0%
kind of this like clinical presentation
of<00:09:36.959><c> mixed</c><00:09:37.279><c> signals</c><00:09:38.320><c> so</c><00:09:38.480><c> like</c><00:09:38.720><c> this</c><00:09:38.959><c> is</c><00:09:39.040><c> what</c>

00:09:39.190 --> 00:09:39.200 align:start position:0%
of mixed signals so like this is what
 

00:09:39.200 --> 00:09:40.470 align:start position:0%
of mixed signals so like this is what
this<00:09:39.360><c> kind</c><00:09:39.440><c> of</c><00:09:39.600><c> looks</c><00:09:39.760><c> like</c><00:09:39.920><c> so</c><00:09:40.080><c> it's</c><00:09:40.240><c> really</c>

00:09:40.470 --> 00:09:40.480 align:start position:0%
this kind of looks like so it's really
 

00:09:40.480 --> 00:09:42.389 align:start position:0%
this kind of looks like so it's really
characterized<00:09:41.040><c> by</c><00:09:41.279><c> mixed</c><00:09:41.600><c> signals</c>

00:09:42.389 --> 00:09:42.399 align:start position:0%
characterized by mixed signals
 

00:09:42.399 --> 00:09:44.790 align:start position:0%
characterized by mixed signals
okay<00:09:43.120><c> and</c><00:09:43.279><c> what</c><00:09:43.440><c> we</c><00:09:43.600><c> mean</c><00:09:43.760><c> by</c><00:09:44.000><c> mixed</c><00:09:44.240><c> signals</c>

00:09:44.790 --> 00:09:44.800 align:start position:0%
okay and what we mean by mixed signals
 

00:09:44.800 --> 00:09:46.550 align:start position:0%
okay and what we mean by mixed signals
is<00:09:44.959><c> like</c><00:09:45.120><c> these</c><00:09:45.360><c> can</c><00:09:45.519><c> be</c><00:09:45.680><c> internal</c><00:09:46.240><c> or</c>

00:09:46.550 --> 00:09:46.560 align:start position:0%
is like these can be internal or
 

00:09:46.560 --> 00:09:49.190 align:start position:0%
is like these can be internal or
external<00:09:47.519><c> so</c><00:09:47.920><c> in</c><00:09:48.080><c> the</c><00:09:48.160><c> relationship</c><00:09:48.880><c> you</c><00:09:48.959><c> can</c>

00:09:49.190 --> 00:09:49.200 align:start position:0%
external so in the relationship you can
 

00:09:49.200 --> 00:09:50.949 align:start position:0%
external so in the relationship you can
send<00:09:49.519><c> signals</c><00:09:49.920><c> to</c><00:09:50.080><c> someone</c><00:09:50.399><c> that</c><00:09:50.720><c> you</c><00:09:50.800><c> know</c>

00:09:50.949 --> 00:09:50.959 align:start position:0%
send signals to someone that you know
 

00:09:50.959 --> 00:09:52.070 align:start position:0%
send signals to someone that you know
you're<00:09:51.200><c> upset</c>

00:09:52.070 --> 00:09:52.080 align:start position:0%
you're upset
 

00:09:52.080 --> 00:09:54.150 align:start position:0%
you're upset

00:09:54.150 --> 00:09:54.160 align:start position:0%
but at the same time like if they ask
 

00:09:54.160 --> 00:09:55.269 align:start position:0%
but at the same time like if they ask
you<00:09:54.480><c> are</c><00:09:54.640><c> you</c><00:09:54.800><c> upset</c>

you're gonna say no so are you upset and
 

00:09:58.320 --> 00:09:58.790 align:start position:0%
you're gonna say no so are you upset and
then<00:09:58.480><c> you</c>

00:09:58.790 --> 00:09:58.800 align:start position:0%
then you
 

00:09:58.800 --> 00:10:02.310 align:start position:0%
then you
say<00:09:59.120><c> no</c><00:10:00.240><c> but</c><00:10:00.399><c> you</c><00:10:00.560><c> mean</c><00:10:00.880><c> yes</c><00:10:01.600><c> so</c><00:10:01.760><c> that's</c><00:10:02.079><c> one</c>

00:10:02.310 --> 00:10:02.320 align:start position:0%
say no but you mean yes so that's one
 

00:10:02.320 --> 00:10:03.750 align:start position:0%
say no but you mean yes so that's one
key<00:10:02.560><c> characteristic</c><00:10:03.279><c> of</c><00:10:03.360><c> the</c><00:10:03.440><c> anxious</c>

00:10:03.750 --> 00:10:03.760 align:start position:0%
key characteristic of the anxious
 

00:10:03.760 --> 00:10:05.269 align:start position:0%
key characteristic of the anxious

00:10:05.279 --> 00:10:06.710 align:start position:0%
ambivalent attachment style
the<00:10:05.440><c> other</c><00:10:05.600><c> thing</c><00:10:05.760><c> is</c><00:10:05.920><c> that</c><00:10:06.240><c> this</c><00:10:06.480><c> mixed</c>

00:10:06.710 --> 00:10:06.720 align:start position:0%
the other thing is that this mixed
 

00:10:06.720 --> 00:10:08.470 align:start position:0%
the other thing is that this mixed
signal<00:10:07.040><c> doesn't</c><00:10:07.279><c> have</c><00:10:07.440><c> to</c><00:10:07.519><c> be</c><00:10:07.839><c> external</c><00:10:08.399><c> it</c>

00:10:08.470 --> 00:10:08.480 align:start position:0%
signal doesn't have to be external it
 

00:10:08.480 --> 00:10:09.990 align:start position:0%
signal doesn't have to be external it
can<00:10:08.640><c> also</c><00:10:08.880><c> be</c><00:10:09.120><c> internal</c>

00:10:09.990 --> 00:10:10.000 align:start position:0%
can also be internal
 

00:10:10.000 --> 00:10:13.110 align:start position:0%
can also be internal
so<00:10:10.160><c> these</c><00:10:10.399><c> people</c><00:10:10.720><c> have</c><00:10:11.040><c> inner</c><00:10:11.360><c> turmoil</c><00:10:12.959><c> so</c>

00:10:13.110 --> 00:10:13.120 align:start position:0%
so these people have inner turmoil so
 

00:10:13.120 --> 00:10:14.230 align:start position:0%
so these people have inner turmoil so
they<00:10:13.279><c> feel</c><00:10:13.519><c> a</c><00:10:13.600><c> lot</c><00:10:13.839><c> of</c><00:10:13.920><c> like</c>

00:19:01.669 --> 00:19:01.679 align:start position:0%
is what the mixed signals are because
 

00:19:01.679 --> 00:19:03.350 align:start position:0%
is what the mixed signals are because
there's<00:19:01.840><c> a</c><00:19:01.919><c> part</c><00:19:02.160><c> of</c><00:19:02.240><c> you</c><00:19:02.400><c> that's</c><00:19:02.640><c> like</c>

so this is sort of what the the anxious
 

00:20:01.520 --> 00:20:03.510 align:start position:0%
so this is sort of what the the anxious
ambivalent<00:20:02.159><c> attachment</c><00:20:02.640><c> style</c><00:20:02.960><c> looks</c>

about it so that's the anxious
ambivalent<00:20:11.120><c> attachment</c>

00:20:11.990 --> 00:20:12.000 align:start position:0%
ambivalent attachment
 

00:20:12.000 --> 00:20:13.669 align:start position:0%

anxious avoidant attachment so the
 

00:20:15.760 --> 00:20:18.710 align:start position:0%
anxious avoidant attachment so the
anxious<00:20:16.320><c> avoidant</c><00:20:16.960><c> attachment</c>

uh<00:22:10.240><c> a</c><00:22:10.480><c> mask</c><00:22:10.960><c> for</c><00:22:11.200><c> their</c><00:22:11.440><c> internal</c><00:22:11.760><c> distress</c>

00:22:12.549 --> 00:22:12.559 align:start position:0%
uh a mask for their internal distress
 

00:22:12.559 --> 00:22:14.470 align:start position:0%
uh a mask for their internal distress
so<00:22:12.720><c> these</c><00:22:12.960><c> people</c><00:22:13.280><c> may</c><00:22:13.520><c> appear</c><00:22:14.000><c> fiercely</c>

00:22:14.470 --> 00:22:14.480 align:start position:0%
so these people may appear fiercely
 

00:22:14.480 --> 00:22:15.990 align:start position:0%
so these people may appear fiercely
independent<00:22:14.960><c> but</c><00:22:15.280><c> internally</c>

00:22:15.990 --> 00:22:16.000 align:start position:0%
independent but internally
 

00:22:16.000 --> 00:22:17.669 align:start position:0%
independent but internally
they're<00:22:16.240><c> like</c><00:22:16.559><c> really</c><00:22:16.880><c> really</c><00:22:17.120><c> distressed</c>

00:22:17.669 --> 00:22:17.679 align:start position:0%
they're like really really distressed
 

00:22:17.679 --> 00:22:19.750 align:start position:0%
they're like really really distressed
about<00:22:17.919><c> it</c><00:22:18.400><c> and</c><00:22:18.559><c> this</c><00:22:18.720><c> is</c><00:22:18.799><c> what's</c><00:22:19.200><c> really</c><00:22:19.520><c> cool</c>

00:22:19.750 --> 00:22:19.760 align:start position:0%
about it and this is what's really cool
 

00:22:19.760 --> 00:22:20.870 align:start position:0%
about it and this is what's really cool
about<00:22:20.000><c> this</c>

00:22:20.870 --> 00:22:20.880 align:start position:0%
about this
 

00:22:20.880 --> 00:22:22.710 align:start position:0%
about this
is<00:22:21.039><c> so</c><00:22:21.280><c> you</c><00:22:21.440><c> know</c><00:22:21.679><c> when</c><00:22:21.840><c> researchers</c><00:22:22.559><c> they</c>

00:22:22.710 --> 00:22:22.720 align:start position:0%
is so you know when researchers they
 

00:22:22.720 --> 00:22:24.070 align:start position:0%
is so you know when researchers they
were<00:22:22.799><c> doing</c><00:22:22.960><c> the</c><00:22:23.120><c> study</c><00:22:23.520><c> like</c><00:22:23.760><c> with</c>

00:22:24.070 --> 00:22:24.080 align:start position:0%
were doing the study like with
 

00:22:24.080 --> 00:22:26.230 align:start position:0%
were doing the study like with
two-year-olds<00:22:24.640><c> right</c><00:22:25.280><c> so</c><00:22:25.600><c> what</c><00:22:25.760><c> researchers</c>

00:22:26.230 --> 00:22:26.240 align:start position:0%
two-year-olds right so what researchers
 

00:22:26.240 --> 00:22:27.510 align:start position:0%
two-year-olds right so what researchers
were<00:22:26.400><c> trying</c><00:22:26.640><c> to</c><00:22:26.720><c> figure</c><00:22:26.960><c> out</c><00:22:27.120><c> is</c><00:22:27.200><c> okay</c><00:22:27.440><c> it</c>

00:22:27.510 --> 00:22:27.520 align:start position:0%
were trying to figure out is okay it
 

00:22:27.520 --> 00:22:29.190 align:start position:0%
were trying to figure out is okay it
seems<00:22:27.760><c> like</c><00:22:27.919><c> the</c><00:22:28.000><c> kid</c><00:22:28.240><c> actually</c><00:22:28.559><c> doesn't</c><00:22:28.880><c> care</c>

00:22:29.190 --> 00:22:29.200 align:start position:0%
seems like the kid actually doesn't care
 

00:22:29.200 --> 00:22:30.630 align:start position:0%
seems like the kid actually doesn't care
whether<00:22:29.440><c> like</c><00:22:29.679><c> mom</c><00:22:29.919><c> is</c><00:22:30.080><c> in</c><00:22:30.159><c> the</c><00:22:30.240><c> room</c>

00:22:30.630 --> 00:22:30.640 align:start position:0%
whether like mom is in the room

00:22:33.110 --> 00:22:33.120 align:start position:0%
or mom is not in the room and they were
 

00:22:33.120 --> 00:22:35.190 align:start position:0%
or mom is not in the room and they were

00:22:35.190 --> 00:22:35.200 align:start position:0%
theorizing like maybe this is a mask for

theorizing like maybe this is a mask for
distress<00:22:35.679><c> like</c><00:22:35.840><c> we're</c><00:22:36.000><c> gonna</c>

00:22:36.390 --> 00:22:36.400 align:start position:0%
distress like we're gonna
 

00:22:36.400 --> 00:22:38.070 align:start position:0%
distress like we're gonna

00:22:38.070 --> 00:22:38.080 align:start position:0%
pretend to be strong and we're gonna say
 

00:22:38.080 --> 00:22:40.390 align:start position:0%
pretend to be strong and we're gonna say
like<00:22:38.559><c> even</c><00:22:38.799><c> though</c><00:22:39.280><c> they're</c><00:22:39.600><c> internally</c><00:22:40.159><c> like</c>

00:22:40.390 --> 00:22:40.400 align:start position:0%
like even though they're internally like
 

00:22:40.400 --> 00:22:41.750 align:start position:0%
like even though they're internally like
they're<00:22:40.559><c> really</c><00:22:40.799><c> freaking</c><00:22:41.200><c> out</c>

00:22:41.750 --> 00:22:41.760 align:start position:0%
they're really freaking out
 

00:22:41.760 --> 00:22:43.110 align:start position:0%
they're really freaking out
on<00:22:41.919><c> the</c><00:22:42.000><c> outside</c><00:22:42.320><c> they're</c><00:22:42.480><c> like</c><00:22:42.640><c> yeah</c><00:22:42.799><c> it's</c><00:22:42.960><c> no</c>

00:22:43.110 --> 00:22:43.120 align:start position:0%
on the outside they're like yeah it's no
 

00:22:43.120 --> 00:22:44.789 align:start position:0%
on the outside they're like yeah it's no
big<00:22:43.280><c> deal</c><00:22:43.440><c> like</c><00:22:43.600><c> i</c><00:22:43.679><c> can</c><00:22:43.840><c> handle</c><00:22:44.080><c> this</c><00:22:44.320><c> i'm</c><00:22:44.480><c> cool</c>

00:22:44.789 --> 00:22:44.799 align:start position:0%
big deal like i can handle this i'm cool
 

00:22:44.799 --> 00:22:46.630 align:start position:0%
big deal like i can handle this i'm cool
like<00:22:45.039><c> it's</c><00:22:45.200><c> a</c><00:22:45.280><c> shell</c>

00:22:46.630 --> 00:22:46.640 align:start position:0%
like it's a shell
 

00:22:46.640 --> 00:22:48.710 align:start position:0%
like it's a shell
so<00:22:46.799><c> what</c><00:22:47.039><c> researchers</c><00:22:47.600><c> did</c><00:22:47.919><c> was</c><00:22:48.159><c> measure</c><00:22:48.559><c> the</c>

00:22:48.710 --> 00:22:48.720 align:start position:0%
so what researchers did was measure the
 

00:22:48.720 --> 00:22:50.950 align:start position:0%
so what researchers did was measure the
heart<00:22:49.039><c> rates</c><00:22:49.520><c> of</c><00:22:49.679><c> the</c><00:22:49.840><c> children</c>

00:22:50.950 --> 00:22:50.960 align:start position:0%
heart rates of the children
 

00:22:50.960 --> 00:22:53.590 align:start position:0%
heart rates of the children
who<00:22:51.679><c> appeared</c><00:22:52.080><c> to</c><00:22:52.240><c> be</c><00:22:52.400><c> completely</c><00:22:52.880><c> fine</c><00:22:53.520><c> and</c>

00:22:53.590 --> 00:22:53.600 align:start position:0%
who appeared to be completely fine and
 

00:22:53.600 --> 00:22:54.070 align:start position:0%
who appeared to be completely fine and
what<00:22:53.760><c> they</c>

00:22:54.070 --> 00:22:54.080 align:start position:0%
what they
 

00:22:54.080 --> 00:22:56.149 align:start position:0%
what they
actually<00:22:54.559><c> found</c><00:22:54.960><c> is</c><00:22:55.120><c> that</c><00:22:55.280><c> physiologically</c>

00:22:56.149 --> 00:22:56.159 align:start position:0%
actually found is that physiologically
 

00:22:56.159 --> 00:22:57.990 align:start position:0%
actually found is that physiologically
these<00:22:56.400><c> children</c><00:22:56.960><c> are</c><00:22:57.200><c> depressed</c>

00:22:57.990 --> 00:22:58.000 align:start position:0%
these children are depressed
 

00:22:58.000 --> 00:23:00.390 align:start position:0%
these children are depressed
i<00:22:58.080><c> mean</c><00:22:58.320><c> distressed</c><00:22:59.120><c> okay</c><00:22:59.679><c> so</c><00:22:59.840><c> what</c><00:23:00.000><c> happened</c>

00:23:00.390 --> 00:23:00.400 align:start position:0%
i mean distressed okay so what happened
 

00:23:00.400 --> 00:23:01.510 align:start position:0%
i mean distressed okay so what happened
is<00:23:00.480><c> like</c><00:23:00.640><c> they</c><00:23:00.799><c> would</c><00:23:00.880><c> measure</c><00:23:01.200><c> the</c><00:23:01.280><c> heart</c>

00:23:01.510 --> 00:23:01.520 align:start position:0%
is like they would measure the heart
 

00:23:01.520 --> 00:23:02.950 align:start position:0%
is like they would measure the heart
rates<00:23:01.760><c> and</c><00:23:01.840><c> what</c><00:23:01.919><c> they'd</c><00:23:02.159><c> find</c><00:23:02.400><c> is</c><00:23:02.480><c> that</c><00:23:02.640><c> like</c>

00:23:02.950 --> 00:23:02.960 align:start position:0%
rates and what they'd find is that like
 

00:23:02.960 --> 00:23:05.669 align:start position:0%
rates and what they'd find is that like
the<00:23:03.120><c> kid</c><00:23:03.360><c> is</c><00:23:03.440><c> putting</c><00:23:03.760><c> on</c><00:23:03.919><c> this</c><00:23:04.240><c> facade</c><00:23:05.520><c> of</c>

00:23:05.669 --> 00:23:05.679 align:start position:0%
the kid is putting on this facade of
 

00:23:05.679 --> 00:23:07.750 align:start position:0%
the kid is putting on this facade of
being<00:23:06.000><c> like</c><00:23:06.320><c> totally</c><00:23:06.720><c> fine</c><00:23:07.120><c> and</c><00:23:07.280><c> not</c><00:23:07.440><c> needing</c>

00:23:07.750 --> 00:23:07.760 align:start position:0%
being like totally fine and not needing
 

00:23:07.760 --> 00:23:09.430 align:start position:0%
being like totally fine and not needing
connection<00:23:08.240><c> and</c><00:23:08.400><c> being</c><00:23:08.640><c> independent</c>

00:23:09.430 --> 00:23:09.440 align:start position:0%
connection and being independent
 

00:23:09.440 --> 00:23:12.630 align:start position:0%
connection and being independent
but<00:23:09.760><c> internally</c><00:23:10.320><c> their</c><00:23:10.559><c> heart</c><00:23:10.799><c> is</c><00:23:10.880><c> hammering</c>

00:23:12.630 --> 00:23:12.640 align:start position:0%
but internally their heart is hammering
 

00:23:12.640 --> 00:23:13.750 align:start position:0%
but internally their heart is hammering
right<00:23:12.880><c> so</c><00:23:13.039><c> they</c><00:23:13.200><c> actually</c><00:23:13.600><c> are</c>

00:23:13.750 --> 00:23:13.760 align:start position:0%
right so they actually are
 

00:23:13.760 --> 00:23:15.909 align:start position:0%
right so they actually are
physiologically<00:23:14.799><c> very</c><00:23:15.039><c> very</c><00:23:15.280><c> distressed</c>

00:23:15.909 --> 00:23:15.919 align:start position:0%
physiologically very very distressed
 

00:23:15.919 --> 00:23:18.310 align:start position:0%
physiologically very very distressed
and<00:23:16.080><c> so</c><00:23:16.400><c> the</c><00:23:16.720><c> anxious</c><00:23:17.200><c> avoidant</c><00:23:17.760><c> attachment</c>

00:23:18.310 --> 00:23:18.320 align:start position:0%
and so the anxious avoidant attachment
 

00:23:18.320 --> 00:23:21.029 align:start position:0%
and so the anxious avoidant attachment
style<00:23:18.799><c> is</c><00:23:18.960><c> sort</c><00:23:19.200><c> of</c><00:23:19.280><c> like</c><00:23:19.520><c> a</c><00:23:19.679><c> protection</c>

00:23:21.029 --> 00:23:21.039 align:start position:0%
style is sort of like a protection
 

00:23:21.039 --> 00:23:25.110 align:start position:0%
style is sort of like a protection
against<00:23:22.240><c> like</c><00:23:22.559><c> the</c><00:23:22.720><c> emotional</c><00:23:23.360><c> hurt</c><00:23:23.760><c> okay</c>

00:23:25.110 --> 00:23:25.120 align:start position:0%
against like the emotional hurt okay
 

00:23:25.120 --> 00:23:27.830 align:start position:0%
against like the emotional hurt okay
so<00:23:25.919><c> um</c><00:23:26.480><c> what</c><00:23:26.640><c> this</c><00:23:26.960><c> actually</c><00:23:27.280><c> means</c><00:23:27.520><c> is</c><00:23:27.679><c> that</c>

00:23:27.830 --> 00:23:27.840 align:start position:0%
so um what this actually means is that
 

00:23:27.840 --> 00:23:29.029 align:start position:0%
so um what this actually means is that
the<00:23:28.080><c> the</c><00:23:28.240><c> kids</c><00:23:28.559><c> are</c><00:23:28.720><c> not</c>

00:23:29.029 --> 00:23:29.039 align:start position:0%
the the kids are not
 

00:23:29.039 --> 00:23:31.110 align:start position:0%
the the kids are not
actually<00:23:29.600><c> fine</c><00:23:30.000><c> right</c><00:23:30.159><c> they</c><00:23:30.320><c> may</c><00:23:30.559><c> appear</c><00:23:30.960><c> to</c>

00:23:31.110 --> 00:23:31.120 align:start position:0%
actually fine right they may appear to

00:23:56.149 --> 00:23:56.159 align:start position:0%

00:23:56.159 --> 00:23:58.870 align:start position:0%
so remember the ambivalent attachment

00:24:52.390 --> 00:24:52.400 align:start position:0%
this sort of creates like
 

00:24:52.400 --> 00:24:55.350 align:start position:0%
this sort of creates like

00:24:55.350 --> 00:24:55.360 align:start position:0%
a really problematic cycle and this is
 

00:24:55.360 --> 00:24:56.630 align:start position:0%
a really problematic cycle and this is

you<00:26:12.559><c> don't</c><00:26:12.720><c> want</c><00:26:12.880><c> to</c><00:26:12.960><c> like</c><00:26:13.120><c> break</c><00:26:13.440><c> up</c><00:26:13.520><c> with</c>

00:26:13.669 --> 00:26:13.679 align:start position:0%
you don't want to like break up with
 

00:26:13.679 --> 00:26:14.950 align:start position:0%
you don't want to like break up with
them

00:26:14.950 --> 00:26:14.960 align:start position:0%
them
 

00:26:14.960 --> 00:26:17.750 align:start position:0%
them
and<00:26:15.039><c> so</c><00:26:15.200><c> you</c><00:26:15.360><c> end</c><00:26:15.600><c> up</c><00:26:15.760><c> by</c><00:26:15.919><c> withdrawing</c><00:26:17.520><c> so</c>

00:26:17.750 --> 00:26:17.760 align:start position:0%
and so you end up by withdrawing so
 

00:26:17.760 --> 00:26:19.430 align:start position:0%
and so you end up by withdrawing so
these<00:26:18.080><c> infants</c><00:26:18.480><c> withdraw</c><00:26:19.039><c> from</c><00:26:19.200><c> their</c>

00:26:19.430 --> 00:26:19.440 align:start position:0%
these infants withdraw from their
 

00:26:19.440 --> 00:26:21.110 align:start position:0%
these infants withdraw from their
caregivers

00:26:21.110 --> 00:26:21.120 align:start position:0%
caregivers
 

00:26:21.120 --> 00:26:22.710 align:start position:0%
caregivers
and<00:26:21.360><c> and</c><00:26:21.520><c> this</c><00:26:21.760><c> is</c><00:26:21.840><c> where</c><00:26:22.000><c> things</c><00:26:22.240><c> get</c><00:26:22.400><c> really</c>

00:26:22.710 --> 00:26:22.720 align:start position:0%
and and this is where things get really
 

00:26:22.720 --> 00:26:24.149 align:start position:0%
and and this is where things get really
weird<00:26:23.039><c> because</c><00:26:23.360><c> actually</c><00:26:23.760><c> what</c>

00:26:24.149 --> 00:26:24.159 align:start position:0%
weird because actually what
 

00:26:24.159 --> 00:26:26.470 align:start position:0%
weird because actually what
we<00:26:24.320><c> do</c><00:26:24.559><c> is</c><00:26:24.720><c> like</c><00:26:24.960><c> we</c><00:26:25.120><c> withdraw</c><00:26:25.760><c> just</c><00:26:26.159><c> enough</c>

00:26:26.470 --> 00:26:26.480 align:start position:0%
we do is like we withdraw just enough
 

00:26:26.480 --> 00:26:28.310 align:start position:0%
we do is like we withdraw just enough
but<00:26:26.640><c> we</c><00:26:26.799><c> never</c><00:26:27.120><c> leave</c><00:26:27.440><c> entirely</c>

00:26:28.310 --> 00:26:28.320 align:start position:0%
but we never leave entirely
 

00:26:28.320 --> 00:26:30.549 align:start position:0%
but we never leave entirely
so<00:26:28.480><c> we</c><00:26:28.720><c> enter</c><00:26:29.039><c> this</c><00:26:29.200><c> like</c><00:26:29.440><c> paradoxical</c><00:26:30.320><c> like</c>

00:26:30.549 --> 00:26:30.559 align:start position:0%
so we enter this like paradoxical like
 

00:26:30.559 --> 00:26:32.470 align:start position:0%
so we enter this like paradoxical like
limbo<00:26:31.039><c> zone</c><00:26:31.360><c> which</c><00:26:31.520><c> is</c><00:26:31.679><c> also</c><00:26:31.919><c> like</c><00:26:32.080><c> the</c><00:26:32.240><c> safe</c>

00:26:32.470 --> 00:26:32.480 align:start position:0%
limbo zone which is also like the safe
 

00:26:32.480 --> 00:26:33.110 align:start position:0%
limbo zone which is also like the safe
zone

00:26:33.110 --> 00:26:33.120 align:start position:0%

00:26:33.120 --> 00:26:35.029 align:start position:0%

where<00:26:33.360><c> it's</c><00:26:33.520><c> like</c><00:26:34.159><c> i'm</c><00:26:34.320><c> never</c><00:26:34.559><c> going</c><00:26:34.720><c> to</c><00:26:34.799><c> get</c>

00:26:35.029 --> 00:26:35.039 align:start position:0%
where it's like i'm never going to get
 

00:26:35.039 --> 00:26:36.470 align:start position:0%
where it's like i'm never going to get

00:26:36.470 --> 00:26:36.480 align:start position:0%
close to you but i
 

00:26:36.480 --> 00:26:38.149 align:start position:0%
close to you but i
i<00:26:36.720><c> want</c><00:26:36.880><c> to</c><00:26:36.960><c> be</c><00:26:37.120><c> close</c><00:26:37.360><c> to</c><00:26:37.440><c> you</c><00:26:37.600><c> so</c><00:26:37.679><c> i'm</c><00:26:37.919><c> never</c>

00:26:38.149 --> 00:26:38.159 align:start position:0%
i want to be close to you so i'm never
 

00:26:38.159 --> 00:26:40.230 align:start position:0%
i want to be close to you so i'm never
going<00:26:38.320><c> to</c><00:26:38.400><c> leave</c><00:26:39.360><c> and</c><00:26:39.440><c> so</c><00:26:39.600><c> it</c><00:26:39.760><c> creates</c><00:26:40.080><c> this</c>

00:26:40.230 --> 00:26:40.240 align:start position:0%
going to leave and so it creates this
 

00:26:40.240 --> 00:26:41.909 align:start position:0%
going to leave and so it creates this
kind<00:26:40.400><c> of</c><00:26:40.559><c> really</c><00:26:40.880><c> tricky</c><00:26:41.200><c> situation</c><00:26:41.679><c> where</c>

00:26:41.909 --> 00:26:41.919 align:start position:0%
kind of really tricky situation where
 

00:26:41.919 --> 00:26:43.510 align:start position:0%
kind of really tricky situation where
like<00:26:42.080><c> men</c><00:26:42.320><c> have</c><00:26:42.559><c> difficulty</c><00:26:43.120><c> connecting</c>

00:26:43.510 --> 00:26:43.520 align:start position:0%
like men have difficulty connecting
 

00:26:43.520 --> 00:26:45.110 align:start position:0%
like men have difficulty connecting
women<00:26:43.760><c> can</c><00:26:43.919><c> do</c><00:26:44.080><c> this</c><00:26:44.240><c> too</c>

00:26:45.110 --> 00:26:45.120 align:start position:0%
women can do this too
 

00:26:45.120 --> 00:26:46.549 align:start position:0%
women can do this too
but<00:26:45.279><c> i</c><00:26:45.360><c> think</c><00:26:45.520><c> that</c><00:26:45.679><c> men</c><00:26:45.840><c> once</c><00:26:46.080><c> again</c><00:26:46.320><c> are</c><00:26:46.400><c> more</c>

00:26:46.549 --> 00:26:46.559 align:start position:0%
but i think that men once again are more
 

00:26:46.559 --> 00:26:49.430 align:start position:0%
but i think that men once again are more
socialized<00:26:47.200><c> to</c><00:26:47.600><c> this</c><00:26:47.760><c> kind</c><00:26:47.919><c> of</c><00:26:48.000><c> behavior</c>

00:26:49.430 --> 00:26:49.440 align:start position:0%
socialized to this kind of behavior
 

00:26:49.440 --> 00:26:52.149 align:start position:0%
socialized to this kind of behavior
and<00:26:49.679><c> so</c><00:26:50.159><c> we</c><00:26:50.320><c> kind</c><00:26:50.480><c> of</c><00:26:50.640><c> stay</c><00:26:50.960><c> at</c><00:26:51.039><c> the</c><00:26:51.279><c> threshold</c>

00:26:52.149 --> 00:26:52.159 align:start position:0%
and so we kind of stay at the threshold
 

00:26:52.159 --> 00:26:53.669 align:start position:0%
and so we kind of stay at the threshold
of<00:26:52.320><c> a</c><00:26:52.400><c> close</c><00:26:52.799><c> relationship</c>

00:26:53.669 --> 00:26:53.679 align:start position:0%
of a close relationship
 

00:26:53.679 --> 00:26:55.510 align:start position:0%
of a close relationship
and<00:26:53.840><c> we're</c><00:26:54.080><c> scared</c><00:26:54.400><c> to</c><00:26:54.559><c> move</c><00:26:54.880><c> closer</c><00:26:55.360><c> and</c>

00:26:55.510 --> 00:26:55.520 align:start position:0%
and we're scared to move closer and
 

00:26:55.520 --> 00:26:57.590 align:start position:0%
and we're scared to move closer and
we're<00:26:55.679><c> scared</c><00:26:56.000><c> to</c><00:26:56.159><c> move</c><00:26:56.400><c> further</c><00:26:56.720><c> away</c>

00:26:57.590 --> 00:26:57.600 align:start position:0%
we're scared to move further away
 

00:26:57.600 --> 00:26:59.510 align:start position:0%
we're scared to move further away

00:26:59.510 --> 00:26:59.520 align:start position:0%

so what this means is this is the
 

00:29:42.080 --> 00:29:44.230 align:start position:0%
so what this means is this is the

into the game just like video games
the<00:30:41.919><c> further</c><00:30:42.320><c> i</c><00:30:42.480><c> go</c><00:30:42.640><c> into</c><00:30:42.880><c> the</c><00:30:42.960><c> game</c><00:30:43.360><c> i</c><00:30:43.520><c> have</c>

00:30:43.909 --> 00:30:43.919 align:start position:0%
the further i go into the game i have
 

00:30:43.919 --> 00:30:46.470 align:start position:0%
the further i go into the game i have

00:30:46.470 --> 00:30:46.480 align:start position:0%
more of a choice about how i play
 

00:30:46.480 --> 00:30:47.990 align:start position:0%
more of a choice about how i play
right<00:30:46.720><c> because</c><00:30:46.880><c> when</c><00:30:47.039><c> i</c><00:30:47.200><c> spawn</c><00:30:47.520><c> like</c><00:30:47.679><c> this</c><00:30:47.919><c> is</c>

00:30:47.990 --> 00:30:48.000 align:start position:0%
right because when i spawn like this is

right because when i spawn like this is

things that we can do about it okay
 

00:31:10.159 --> 00:31:11.830 align:start position:0%
things that we can do about it okay
the<00:31:10.399><c> first</c><00:31:10.799><c> is</c><00:31:10.960><c> to</c><00:31:11.120><c> understand</c><00:31:11.519><c> that</c><00:31:11.679><c> your</c>

00:31:13.909 --> 00:31:13.919 align:start position:0%
fate is not set in stone
 

00:31:13.919 --> 00:31:17.509 align:start position:0%
fate is not set in stone
and<00:31:14.159><c> essentially</c><00:31:16.080><c> the</c><00:31:16.320><c> people</c><00:31:16.720><c> that</c><00:31:16.960><c> you</c><00:31:17.200><c> hang</c>

and essentially the people that you hang
 

00:31:17.519 --> 00:31:18.149 align:start position:0%
and essentially the people that you hang
out<00:31:17.679><c> with</c>

out with
 

00:31:18.159 --> 00:31:20.630 align:start position:0%
out with
will<00:31:18.399><c> determine</c><00:31:19.200><c> how</c><00:31:19.360><c> your</c><00:31:19.600><c> attachment</c><00:31:20.159><c> style</c>

will determine how your attachment style
 

00:31:20.640 --> 00:31:21.430 align:start position:0%
will determine how your attachment style
evolves

00:31:21.430 --> 00:31:21.440 align:start position:0%
evolves
 

00:31:21.440 --> 00:31:22.870 align:start position:0%
evolves
so<00:31:21.600><c> this</c><00:31:21.760><c> is</c><00:31:21.840><c> where</c><00:31:22.080><c> you</c><00:31:22.159><c> have</c><00:31:22.240><c> to</c><00:31:22.399><c> be</c><00:31:22.559><c> really</c>
