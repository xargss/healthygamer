00:04:17.270 --> 00:04:17.280 align:start position:0%
like i'm going to do this thing right
 

00:04:17.280 --> 00:04:17.509 align:start position:0%
like i'm going to do this thing right
and

00:04:17.509 --> 00:04:17.519 align:start position:0%
and
 

00:04:17.519 --> 00:04:18.710 align:start position:0%
and
i<00:04:17.600><c> don't</c><00:04:17.680><c> think</c><00:04:17.840><c> any</c><00:04:18.000><c> of</c><00:04:18.160><c> them</c><00:04:18.239><c> work</c><00:04:18.479><c> but</c><00:04:18.560><c> i'll</c>

00:04:18.710 --> 00:04:18.720 align:start position:0%
i don't think any of them work but i'll
 

00:04:18.720 --> 00:04:19.830 align:start position:0%
i don't think any of them work but i'll
share<00:04:18.880><c> it</c><00:04:18.959><c> anyway</c><00:04:19.280><c> i</c><00:04:19.359><c> think</c><00:04:19.440><c> there's</c><00:04:19.680><c> an</c>

00:04:19.830 --> 00:04:19.840 align:start position:0%
share it anyway i think there's an
 

00:04:19.840 --> 00:04:21.590 align:start position:0%
share it anyway i think there's an
important<00:04:20.239><c> principle</c><00:04:20.639><c> here</c><00:04:20.880><c> that</c><00:04:21.199><c> is</c>

00:04:21.590 --> 00:04:21.600 align:start position:0%
important principle here that is
 

00:04:21.600 --> 00:04:24.150 align:start position:0%
important principle here that is
accurate<00:04:22.720><c> is</c><00:04:23.120><c> so</c><00:04:23.280><c> the</c><00:04:23.440><c> cool</c><00:04:23.680><c> thing</c><00:04:23.840><c> that</c><00:04:24.000><c> that</c>

00:04:24.150 --> 00:04:24.160 align:start position:0%
accurate is so the cool thing that that
 

00:04:24.160 --> 00:04:25.670 align:start position:0%
accurate is so the cool thing that that
allowed<00:04:24.400><c> me</c><00:04:24.560><c> to</c><00:04:24.639><c> do</c><00:04:24.880><c> and</c><00:04:25.040><c> this</c><00:04:25.199><c> strategy</c><00:04:25.600><c> is</c>

00:04:25.670 --> 00:04:25.680 align:start position:0%
allowed me to do and this strategy is
 

00:04:25.680 --> 00:04:26.710 align:start position:0%
allowed me to do and this strategy is
dumb<00:04:26.000><c> but</c>

00:04:26.710 --> 00:04:26.720 align:start position:0%
dumb but
 

00:04:26.720 --> 00:04:28.150 align:start position:0%
dumb but
the<00:04:26.880><c> cool</c><00:04:27.040><c> thing</c><00:04:27.199><c> it</c><00:04:27.360><c> allowed</c><00:04:27.600><c> me</c><00:04:27.680><c> to</c><00:04:27.759><c> do</c><00:04:28.000><c> is</c>

00:04:28.150 --> 00:04:28.160 align:start position:0%
the cool thing it allowed me to do is
 

00:04:28.160 --> 00:04:30.070 align:start position:0%
the cool thing it allowed me to do is
like<00:04:28.479><c> let</c><00:04:28.720><c> go</c><00:04:28.880><c> of</c><00:04:28.960><c> the</c><00:04:29.199><c> expectation</c><00:04:29.919><c> that</c>

00:04:30.070 --> 00:04:30.080 align:start position:0%
like let go of the expectation that
 

00:04:30.080 --> 00:04:31.430 align:start position:0%
like let go of the expectation that
something<00:04:30.400><c> has</c><00:04:30.560><c> to</c><00:04:30.720><c> come</c><00:04:30.880><c> out</c><00:04:31.040><c> of</c><00:04:31.120><c> this</c><00:04:31.280><c> and</c><00:04:31.360><c> i</c>

00:04:31.430 --> 00:04:31.440 align:start position:0%
something has to come out of this and i
 

00:04:31.440 --> 00:04:33.909 align:start position:0%
something has to come out of this and i

have to get this person to like me
 

00:04:33.919 --> 00:04:35.590 align:start position:0%
have to get this person to like me
right<00:04:34.320><c> and</c><00:04:34.479><c> i</c><00:04:34.560><c> think</c><00:04:34.720><c> that</c><00:04:34.800><c> this</c><00:04:35.040><c> is</c><00:04:35.120><c> where</c><00:04:35.520><c> if</c>
