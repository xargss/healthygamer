we're going to talk a little bit about
evolution

00:02:41.830 --> 00:02:41.840 align:start position:0%
evolution
 

00:02:41.840 --> 00:02:43.670 align:start position:0%
evolution
so<00:02:42.000><c> do</c><00:02:42.160><c> you</c><00:02:42.319><c> guys</c><00:02:42.640><c> know</c><00:02:43.040><c> what</c><00:02:43.200><c> the</c><00:02:43.360><c> word</c>

00:02:43.670 --> 00:02:43.680 align:start position:0%
so do you guys know what the word
 

00:02:43.680 --> 00:02:47.190 align:start position:0%
so do you guys know what the word
vestigial<00:02:44.480><c> means</c>

00:02:47.190 --> 00:02:47.200 align:start position:0%
 
 

00:02:47.200 --> 00:02:48.949 align:start position:0%
 
anyone<00:02:47.519><c> know</c>

00:02:48.949 --> 00:02:48.959 align:start position:0%
anyone know
 

00:02:48.959 --> 00:02:50.869 align:start position:0%
anyone know
so<00:02:49.120><c> a</c><00:02:49.280><c> vestigial</c>

00:02:50.869 --> 00:02:50.879 align:start position:0%
so a vestigial
 

00:02:50.879 --> 00:02:54.229 align:start position:0%
so a vestigial
limb<00:02:51.599><c> is</c><00:02:51.760><c> something</c><00:02:52.319><c> that</c><00:02:52.959><c> is</c><00:02:53.200><c> like</c><00:02:53.519><c> no</c><00:02:53.760><c> longer</c>

00:02:54.229 --> 00:02:54.239 align:start position:0%
limb is something that is like no longer
 

00:02:54.239 --> 00:02:56.070 align:start position:0%
limb is something that is like no longer
necessary<00:02:55.200><c> okay</c>

00:02:56.070 --> 00:02:56.080 align:start position:0%
necessary okay
 

00:02:56.080 --> 00:02:58.630 align:start position:0%
necessary okay
so<00:02:56.400><c> in</c><00:02:56.720><c> evolution</c>

00:02:58.630 --> 00:02:58.640 align:start position:0%
so in evolution
 

00:02:58.640 --> 00:03:01.190 align:start position:0%
so in evolution
we<00:02:58.879><c> evolve</c><00:02:59.280><c> things</c><00:02:59.760><c> so</c><00:02:59.920><c> for</c><00:03:00.159><c> example</c><00:03:00.640><c> snakes</c>

00:03:01.190 --> 00:03:01.200 align:start position:0%
we evolve things so for example snakes
 

00:03:01.200 --> 00:03:02.790 align:start position:0%
we evolve things so for example snakes
actually<00:03:01.680><c> have</c><00:03:02.080><c> like</c>

00:03:02.790 --> 00:03:02.800 align:start position:0%
actually have like
 

00:03:02.800 --> 00:03:04.710 align:start position:0%
actually have like
some<00:03:03.280><c> i</c><00:03:03.360><c> think</c><00:03:03.519><c> most</c><00:03:03.760><c> snakes</c><00:03:04.159><c> actually</c><00:03:04.480><c> have</c>

00:03:04.710 --> 00:03:04.720 align:start position:0%
some i think most snakes actually have
 

00:03:04.720 --> 00:03:06.949 align:start position:0%
some i think most snakes actually have
legs<00:03:05.599><c> so</c><00:03:05.760><c> they</c><00:03:05.920><c> have</c><00:03:06.000><c> these</c><00:03:06.239><c> like</c><00:03:06.400><c> tiny</c><00:03:06.720><c> little</c>

00:03:06.949 --> 00:03:06.959 align:start position:0%
legs so they have these like tiny little
 

00:03:06.959 --> 00:03:08.630 align:start position:0%
legs so they have these like tiny little
legs<00:03:07.280><c> which</c><00:03:07.440><c> are</c><00:03:07.680><c> i</c><00:03:07.760><c> think</c><00:03:07.920><c> primarily</c><00:03:08.400><c> used</c>

00:03:08.630 --> 00:03:08.640 align:start position:0%
legs which are i think primarily used
 

00:03:08.640 --> 00:03:10.309 align:start position:0%
legs which are i think primarily used
for<00:03:08.800><c> essentially</c><00:03:09.280><c> mating</c>

00:03:10.309 --> 00:03:10.319 align:start position:0%
for essentially mating
 

00:03:10.319 --> 00:03:11.830 align:start position:0%
for essentially mating
but<00:03:10.480><c> they</c><00:03:10.640><c> have</c><00:03:10.879><c> these</c><00:03:11.040><c> tiny</c><00:03:11.280><c> little</c><00:03:11.519><c> legs</c>

00:03:11.830 --> 00:03:11.840 align:start position:0%
but they have these tiny little legs
 

00:03:11.840 --> 00:03:13.990 align:start position:0%
but they have these tiny little legs
which<00:03:12.000><c> are</c><00:03:12.159><c> like</c><00:03:12.400><c> tiny</c><00:03:12.720><c> and</c><00:03:12.800><c> small</c><00:03:13.519><c> so</c><00:03:13.760><c> some</c>

00:03:13.990 --> 00:03:14.000 align:start position:0%
which are like tiny and small so some
 

00:03:14.000 --> 00:03:15.670 align:start position:0%
which are like tiny and small so some
people<00:03:14.239><c> have</c><00:03:14.400><c> said</c><00:03:14.640><c> that</c><00:03:14.879><c> for</c><00:03:15.040><c> human</c><00:03:15.360><c> beings</c>

00:03:15.670 --> 00:03:15.680 align:start position:0%
people have said that for human beings
 

00:03:15.680 --> 00:03:19.350 align:start position:0%
people have said that for human beings
the<00:03:15.840><c> appendix</c><00:03:16.480><c> is</c><00:03:16.640><c> a</c><00:03:16.720><c> vestigial</c><00:03:17.519><c> organ</c>

00:03:19.350 --> 00:03:19.360 align:start position:0%
the appendix is a vestigial organ
 

00:03:19.360 --> 00:03:21.030 align:start position:0%
the appendix is a vestigial organ
and<00:03:19.519><c> so</c><00:03:19.680><c> the</c><00:03:19.840><c> running</c><00:03:20.159><c> theory</c><00:03:20.480><c> that</c><00:03:20.640><c> i</c><00:03:20.800><c> like</c>

00:03:21.030 --> 00:03:21.040 align:start position:0%
and so the running theory that i like
 

00:03:21.040 --> 00:03:23.110 align:start position:0%
and so the running theory that i like
about<00:03:21.200><c> what</c><00:03:21.360><c> the</c><00:03:21.519><c> appendix</c><00:03:22.000><c> is</c><00:03:22.080><c> for</c>

00:03:23.110 --> 00:03:23.120 align:start position:0%
about what the appendix is for
 

00:03:23.120 --> 00:03:25.270 align:start position:0%
about what the appendix is for
is<00:03:23.280><c> that</c><00:03:23.360><c> the</c><00:03:23.519><c> appendix</c><00:03:24.159><c> is</c><00:03:24.319><c> a</c><00:03:24.480><c> storage</c><00:03:25.120><c> of</c>

00:03:25.270 --> 00:03:25.280 align:start position:0%
is that the appendix is a storage of
 

00:03:25.280 --> 00:03:27.430 align:start position:0%
is that the appendix is a storage of
bacteria<00:03:26.319><c> so</c><00:03:26.480><c> it's</c><00:03:26.640><c> basically</c><00:03:27.040><c> like</c><00:03:27.280><c> if</c><00:03:27.360><c> you</c>

00:03:27.430 --> 00:03:27.440 align:start position:0%
bacteria so it's basically like if you
 

00:03:27.440 --> 00:03:28.949 align:start position:0%
bacteria so it's basically like if you
look<00:03:27.599><c> at</c><00:03:27.680><c> your</c><00:03:27.840><c> intestine</c><00:03:28.319><c> your</c><00:03:28.480><c> intestine</c><00:03:28.879><c> is</c>

00:03:28.949 --> 00:03:28.959 align:start position:0%
look at your intestine your intestine is
 

00:03:28.959 --> 00:03:30.710 align:start position:0%
look at your intestine your intestine is
like<00:03:29.120><c> a</c><00:03:29.200><c> loop</c><00:03:29.519><c> right</c><00:03:29.920><c> and</c><00:03:30.080><c> it</c><00:03:30.159><c> has</c><00:03:30.319><c> this</c><00:03:30.480><c> little</c>

00:03:30.710 --> 00:03:30.720 align:start position:0%
like a loop right and it has this little
 

00:03:30.720 --> 00:03:32.710 align:start position:0%
like a loop right and it has this little
like<00:03:31.040><c> pocket</c><00:03:31.599><c> off</c><00:03:31.760><c> to</c><00:03:31.920><c> the</c><00:03:32.080><c> side</c><00:03:32.400><c> let's</c><00:03:32.560><c> say</c>

00:03:32.710 --> 00:03:32.720 align:start position:0%
like pocket off to the side let's say
 

00:03:32.720 --> 00:03:34.470 align:start position:0%
like pocket off to the side let's say
like<00:03:32.959><c> there's</c><00:03:33.200><c> just</c><00:03:33.360><c> a</c><00:03:33.440><c> pocket</c><00:03:33.760><c> over</c><00:03:34.000><c> here</c>

00:03:34.470 --> 00:03:34.480 align:start position:0%
like there's just a pocket over here
 

00:03:34.480 --> 00:03:36.309 align:start position:0%
like there's just a pocket over here
that<00:03:34.640><c> just</c><00:03:34.879><c> stores</c><00:03:35.200><c> a</c><00:03:35.280><c> bunch</c><00:03:35.519><c> of</c><00:03:35.599><c> bacteria</c><00:03:36.159><c> and</c>

00:03:36.309 --> 00:03:36.319 align:start position:0%
that just stores a bunch of bacteria and
 

00:03:36.319 --> 00:03:37.750 align:start position:0%
that just stores a bunch of bacteria and
why<00:03:36.560><c> is</c><00:03:36.720><c> that</c><00:03:36.879><c> important</c><00:03:37.280><c> or</c><00:03:37.360><c> why</c><00:03:37.519><c> did</c><00:03:37.599><c> that</c>

00:03:37.750 --> 00:03:37.760 align:start position:0%
why is that important or why did that
 

00:03:37.760 --> 00:03:39.910 align:start position:0%
why is that important or why did that
used<00:03:37.920><c> to</c><00:03:38.080><c> be</c><00:03:38.159><c> important</c><00:03:38.959><c> so</c><00:03:39.200><c> as</c><00:03:39.360><c> human</c><00:03:39.599><c> beings</c>

00:03:39.910 --> 00:03:39.920 align:start position:0%
used to be important so as human beings
 

00:03:39.920 --> 00:03:42.710 align:start position:0%
used to be important so as human beings
when<00:03:40.080><c> we</c><00:03:40.239><c> used</c><00:03:40.480><c> to</c><00:03:40.560><c> get</c><00:03:40.799><c> diarrheal</c><00:03:41.440><c> illnesses</c>

00:03:42.710 --> 00:03:42.720 align:start position:0%
when we used to get diarrheal illnesses
 

00:03:42.720 --> 00:03:44.630 align:start position:0%
when we used to get diarrheal illnesses
our<00:03:42.879><c> bacteria</c><00:03:43.440><c> our</c><00:03:43.599><c> gut</c><00:03:43.760><c> would</c><00:03:43.920><c> get</c><00:03:44.080><c> infected</c>

00:03:44.630 --> 00:03:44.640 align:start position:0%
our bacteria our gut would get infected
 

00:03:44.640 --> 00:03:46.229 align:start position:0%
our bacteria our gut would get infected
with<00:03:44.799><c> some</c><00:03:44.959><c> kind</c><00:03:45.120><c> of</c><00:03:45.200><c> bacteria</c><00:03:45.920><c> and</c><00:03:46.000><c> we'd</c>

00:03:46.229 --> 00:03:46.239 align:start position:0%
with some kind of bacteria and we'd
 

00:03:46.239 --> 00:03:49.030 align:start position:0%
with some kind of bacteria and we'd
flush<00:03:46.640><c> that</c><00:03:46.799><c> bacteria</c><00:03:47.519><c> out</c><00:03:48.159><c> and</c><00:03:48.319><c> we'd</c><00:03:48.560><c> flush</c>

00:03:49.030 --> 00:03:49.040 align:start position:0%
flush that bacteria out and we'd flush
 

00:03:49.040 --> 00:03:51.030 align:start position:0%
flush that bacteria out and we'd flush
all<00:03:49.200><c> the</c><00:03:49.360><c> bacteria</c><00:03:49.920><c> out</c><00:03:50.000><c> of</c><00:03:50.159><c> our</c><00:03:50.239><c> system</c><00:03:50.959><c> and</c>

00:03:51.030 --> 00:03:51.040 align:start position:0%
all the bacteria out of our system and
 

00:03:51.040 --> 00:03:53.110 align:start position:0%
all the bacteria out of our system and
so<00:03:51.200><c> then</c><00:03:51.440><c> our</c><00:03:51.680><c> gi</c><00:03:52.080><c> tract</c><00:03:52.319><c> would</c><00:03:52.560><c> no</c><00:03:52.720><c> longer</c>

00:03:53.110 --> 00:03:53.120 align:start position:0%
so then our gi tract would no longer
 

00:03:53.120 --> 00:03:55.190 align:start position:0%
so then our gi tract would no longer
have<00:03:53.519><c> much</c><00:03:53.840><c> good</c><00:03:54.000><c> bacteria</c>

00:03:55.190 --> 00:03:55.200 align:start position:0%
have much good bacteria
 

00:03:55.200 --> 00:03:56.070 align:start position:0%
have much good bacteria
so

00:03:56.070 --> 00:03:56.080 align:start position:0%
so
 

00:03:56.080 --> 00:03:57.910 align:start position:0%
so
as<00:03:56.319><c> we</c><00:03:56.480><c> would</c><00:03:56.640><c> get</c><00:03:56.799><c> healthy</c><00:03:57.200><c> again</c><00:03:57.680><c> if</c><00:03:57.760><c> we</c>

as we would get healthy again if we

as we would get healthy again if we

00:04:00.550 --> 00:04:00.560 align:start position:0%
weren't careful we would populate our gi
 

00:04:00.560 --> 00:04:02.470 align:start position:0%
weren't careful we would populate our gi

00:04:33.990 --> 00:04:34.000 align:start position:0%
like it needs to come out and then they
 

00:04:34.000 --> 00:04:36.310 align:start position:0%
like it needs to come out and then they
started<00:04:34.320><c> removing</c><00:04:34.639><c> appendices</c><00:04:35.759><c> and</c><00:04:35.840><c> then</c>

00:04:36.310 --> 00:04:36.320 align:start position:0%
started removing appendices and then
 

00:04:36.320 --> 00:04:37.830 align:start position:0%
started removing appendices and then
well<00:04:36.560><c> the</c><00:04:36.720><c> appendix</c>

00:04:37.830 --> 00:04:37.840 align:start position:0%
well the appendix
 

00:04:37.840 --> 00:04:40.150 align:start position:0%
well the appendix
um<00:04:38.560><c> appendixes</c><00:04:39.199><c> maybe</c>

00:04:40.150 --> 00:04:40.160 align:start position:0%
um appendixes maybe
 

00:04:40.160 --> 00:04:41.990 align:start position:0%
um appendixes maybe
and<00:04:40.320><c> then</c><00:04:40.720><c> what</c><00:04:40.880><c> they</c><00:04:41.040><c> sort</c><00:04:41.199><c> of</c><00:04:41.360><c> discovered</c><00:04:41.919><c> is</c>

00:04:41.990 --> 00:04:42.000 align:start position:0%
and then what they sort of discovered is
 

00:04:42.000 --> 00:04:43.670 align:start position:0%
and then what they sort of discovered is
that<00:04:42.160><c> like</c><00:04:42.479><c> people</c><00:04:42.800><c> seem</c><00:04:42.960><c> to</c><00:04:43.120><c> be</c><00:04:43.199><c> doing</c><00:04:43.440><c> fine</c>

00:04:43.670 --> 00:04:43.680 align:start position:0%
that like people seem to be doing fine
 

00:04:43.680 --> 00:04:44.950 align:start position:0%
that like people seem to be doing fine
without<00:04:44.000><c> it</c><00:04:44.080><c> so</c><00:04:44.160><c> it</c><00:04:44.320><c> doesn't</c><00:04:44.479><c> seem</c><00:04:44.720><c> like</c><00:04:44.880><c> the</c>

00:04:44.950 --> 00:04:44.960 align:start position:0%
without it so it doesn't seem like the
 

00:04:44.960 --> 00:04:46.629 align:start position:0%
without it so it doesn't seem like the
appendix<00:04:45.440><c> actually</c><00:04:45.759><c> causes</c><00:04:46.240><c> like</c><00:04:46.400><c> losing</c>

00:04:46.629 --> 00:04:46.639 align:start position:0%
appendix actually causes like losing
 

00:04:46.639 --> 00:04:48.150 align:start position:0%
appendix actually causes like losing
your<00:04:46.800><c> appendix</c><00:04:47.199><c> doesn't</c><00:04:47.440><c> seem</c><00:04:47.600><c> to</c><00:04:47.680><c> cause</c><00:04:47.919><c> any</c>

00:04:48.150 --> 00:04:48.160 align:start position:0%
your appendix doesn't seem to cause any
 

00:04:48.160 --> 00:04:50.230 align:start position:0%
your appendix doesn't seem to cause any
problems<00:04:48.880><c> so</c><00:04:49.040><c> that's</c><00:04:49.280><c> an</c><00:04:49.360><c> example</c><00:04:49.759><c> of</c><00:04:49.840><c> that</c><00:04:50.080><c> of</c>

00:04:50.230 --> 00:04:50.240 align:start position:0%
problems so that's an example of that of
 

00:04:50.240 --> 00:04:52.070 align:start position:0%
problems so that's an example of that of
a<00:04:50.320><c> vestigial</c><00:04:51.120><c> organ</c><00:04:51.360><c> maybe</c><00:04:51.600><c> the</c><00:04:51.680><c> appendix</c>

00:04:52.070 --> 00:04:52.080 align:start position:0%
a vestigial organ maybe the appendix
 

00:04:52.080 --> 00:04:53.430 align:start position:0%
a vestigial organ maybe the appendix
does<00:04:52.479><c> do</c><00:04:52.639><c> something</c><00:04:52.880><c> and</c><00:04:53.040><c> i</c><00:04:53.120><c> just</c><00:04:53.280><c> don't</c>

00:04:53.430 --> 00:04:53.440 align:start position:0%
does do something and i just don't
 

00:04:53.440 --> 00:04:54.710 align:start position:0%
does do something and i just don't
really<00:04:53.600><c> know</c><00:04:53.759><c> about</c><00:04:53.919><c> it</c><00:04:54.080><c> i'm</c><00:04:54.160><c> not</c><00:04:54.320><c> a</c><00:04:54.400><c> gi</c>

00:04:54.710 --> 00:04:54.720 align:start position:0%
really know about it i'm not a gi
 

00:04:54.720 --> 00:04:56.469 align:start position:0%
really know about it i'm not a gi

so<00:04:56.639><c> a</c><00:04:56.720><c> lot</c><00:04:56.880><c> of</c><00:04:57.040><c> times</c><00:04:57.840><c> evolution</c><00:04:58.479><c> will</c><00:04:58.639><c> sort</c><00:04:58.800><c> of</c>

00:04:59.030 --> 00:04:59.040 align:start position:0%
so a lot of times evolution will sort of
 

00:04:59.040 --> 00:05:01.909 align:start position:0%
so a lot of times evolution will sort of
have<00:04:59.680><c> vestigial</c><00:05:00.560><c> parts</c><00:05:01.039><c> that</c><00:05:01.280><c> no</c><00:05:01.520><c> longer</c>

i<00:05:04.160><c> think</c><00:05:04.320><c> what's</c><00:05:04.560><c> happening</c><00:05:04.960><c> right</c><00:05:05.120><c> now</c><00:05:05.360><c> in</c>

00:05:10.469 --> 00:05:10.479 align:start position:0%
something that used to be so basic
