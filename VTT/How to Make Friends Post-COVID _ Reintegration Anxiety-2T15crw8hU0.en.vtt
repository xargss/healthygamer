00:06:39.670 --> 00:06:39.680 align:start position:0%
what tends to happen is that our brain
 

00:06:39.680 --> 00:06:41.430 align:start position:0%
what tends to happen is that our brain

00:10:01.190 --> 00:10:01.200 align:start position:0%
this situation where like we're we're
 

00:10:01.200 --> 00:10:03.110 align:start position:0%
this situation where like we're we're
basically<00:10:01.680><c> like</c><00:10:01.920><c> out</c><00:10:02.160><c> of</c><00:10:02.320><c> practice</c>

00:10:03.110 --> 00:10:03.120 align:start position:0%
basically like out of practice
 

00:10:03.120 --> 00:10:05.190 align:start position:0%
basically like out of practice
integrating<00:10:03.680><c> into</c><00:10:03.920><c> the</c><00:10:04.000><c> real</c><00:10:04.240><c> world</c><00:10:04.480><c> again</c>

00:10:05.190 --> 00:10:05.200 align:start position:0%
integrating into the real world again
 

00:10:05.200 --> 00:10:06.630 align:start position:0%
integrating into the real world again
and<00:10:05.360><c> since</c><00:10:05.600><c> we're</c><00:10:05.839><c> out</c><00:10:06.000><c> of</c><00:10:06.079><c> practice</c><00:10:06.480><c> this</c>

00:10:06.630 --> 00:10:06.640 align:start position:0%
and since we're out of practice this
 

00:10:06.640 --> 00:10:08.630 align:start position:0%
and since we're out of practice this
sort<00:10:06.880><c> of</c><00:10:06.959><c> results</c><00:10:07.360><c> in</c><00:10:07.519><c> anxiety</c>

00:10:08.630 --> 00:10:08.640 align:start position:0%
sort of results in anxiety
 

00:10:08.640 --> 00:10:10.470 align:start position:0%
sort of results in anxiety
and<00:10:08.720><c> so</c><00:10:08.959><c> people</c><00:10:09.279><c> sort</c><00:10:09.440><c> of</c><00:10:09.600><c> ask</c><00:10:09.760><c> me</c><00:10:10.000><c> okay</c><00:10:10.240><c> what</c>

00:10:10.470 --> 00:10:10.480 align:start position:0%
and so people sort of ask me okay what
 

00:10:10.480 --> 00:10:11.670 align:start position:0%
and so people sort of ask me okay what
should<00:10:10.640><c> i</c><00:10:10.880><c> do</c><00:10:11.040><c> about</c><00:10:11.360><c> this</c>

00:10:11.670 --> 00:10:11.680 align:start position:0%
should i do about this
 

00:10:11.680 --> 00:10:14.150 align:start position:0%
should i do about this
right<00:10:12.560><c> and</c><00:10:12.720><c> so</c><00:10:12.880><c> this</c><00:10:13.120><c> is</c><00:10:13.440><c> the</c><00:10:13.519><c> kind</c><00:10:13.680><c> of</c><00:10:13.839><c> tricky</c>

00:10:14.150 --> 00:10:14.160 align:start position:0%
right and so this is the kind of tricky
 

00:10:14.160 --> 00:10:17.670 align:start position:0%
right and so this is the kind of tricky
part<00:10:14.480><c> but</c><00:10:14.640><c> like</c><00:10:14.800><c> there's</c><00:10:15.200><c> no</c><00:10:15.519><c> way</c><00:10:15.920><c> to</c>

00:10:17.670 --> 00:10:17.680 align:start position:0%
part but like there's no way to
 

00:10:17.680 --> 00:10:19.509 align:start position:0%
part but like there's no way to
artificially<00:10:18.480><c> turn</c><00:10:18.720><c> on</c><00:10:18.880><c> those</c><00:10:19.120><c> circuits</c>

00:10:19.509 --> 00:10:19.519 align:start position:0%
artificially turn on those circuits
 

00:10:19.519 --> 00:10:21.110 align:start position:0%
artificially turn on those circuits
again<00:10:19.920><c> and</c><00:10:20.000><c> there's</c><00:10:20.240><c> no</c><00:10:20.399><c> way</c><00:10:20.640><c> that</c><00:10:20.800><c> i've</c><00:10:20.959><c> been</c>

00:10:21.110 --> 00:10:21.120 align:start position:0%
again and there's no way that i've been
 

00:10:21.120 --> 00:10:22.710 align:start position:0%
again and there's no way that i've been
able<00:10:21.279><c> to</c><00:10:21.440><c> discover</c><00:10:21.839><c> to</c><00:10:22.000><c> sort</c><00:10:22.240><c> of</c><00:10:22.320><c> make</c><00:10:22.560><c> it</c>

00:10:22.710 --> 00:10:22.720 align:start position:0%

00:10:22.720 --> 00:10:23.670 align:start position:0%
able to discover to sort of make it

march or april some places started
in<00:14:55.680><c> person</c><00:14:56.000><c> classes</c><00:14:56.399><c> then</c><00:14:57.040><c> i</c><00:14:57.199><c> noticed</c><00:14:57.440><c> that</c>

00:14:57.590 --> 00:14:57.600 align:start position:0%
in person classes then i noticed that
 

00:14:57.600 --> 00:14:59.430 align:start position:0%
in person classes then i noticed that
people<00:14:57.839><c> also</c><00:14:58.079><c> had</c><00:14:58.240><c> reintegration</c><00:14:58.959><c> anxiety</c>

00:14:59.430 --> 00:14:59.440 align:start position:0%
people also had reintegration anxiety
 

00:14:59.440 --> 00:15:00.710 align:start position:0%
people also had reintegration anxiety
and<00:14:59.600><c> it</c><00:14:59.680><c> kind</c><00:14:59.839><c> of</c><00:14:59.920><c> got</c><00:15:00.079><c> better</c>

00:15:00.710 --> 00:15:00.720 align:start position:0%
and it kind of got better
 

00:15:00.720 --> 00:15:02.310 align:start position:0%
and it kind of got better
yeah<00:15:00.959><c> so</c><00:15:01.120><c> someone's</c><00:15:01.440><c> asking</c><00:15:01.760><c> what</c><00:15:01.920><c> if</c><00:15:02.000><c> you</c><00:15:02.160><c> had</c>

00:15:02.310 --> 00:15:02.320 align:start position:0%
yeah so someone's asking what if you had
 

00:15:02.320 --> 00:15:04.069 align:start position:0%
yeah so someone's asking what if you had
social<00:15:02.639><c> anxiety</c><00:15:03.199><c> before</c>

00:15:04.069 --> 00:15:04.079 align:start position:0%
social anxiety before
 

00:15:04.079 --> 00:15:06.150 align:start position:0%
social anxiety before
and<00:15:04.240><c> it's</c><00:15:04.480><c> worse</c><00:15:04.880><c> now</c><00:15:05.120><c> during</c><00:15:05.360><c> covid</c><00:15:05.920><c> i</c><00:15:06.000><c> think</c>

00:15:06.150 --> 00:15:06.160 align:start position:0%
and it's worse now during covid i think
 

00:15:06.160 --> 00:15:07.670 align:start position:0%
and it's worse now during covid i think
i've<00:15:06.320><c> seen</c><00:15:06.560><c> the</c><00:15:06.639><c> same</c><00:15:06.959><c> thing</c>

00:15:07.670 --> 00:15:07.680 align:start position:0%
i've seen the same thing
 

00:15:07.680 --> 00:15:09.829 align:start position:0%
i've seen the same thing
so<00:15:07.839><c> the</c><00:15:07.920><c> reason</c><00:15:08.320><c> it's</c><00:15:08.560><c> worse</c><00:15:09.040><c> as</c><00:15:09.199><c> far</c><00:15:09.440><c> as</c><00:15:09.600><c> i</c><00:15:09.680><c> can</c>

00:15:09.829 --> 00:15:09.839 align:start position:0%
so the reason it's worse as far as i can
 

00:15:09.839 --> 00:15:11.750 align:start position:0%
so the reason it's worse as far as i can
tell<00:15:10.160><c> is</c><00:15:10.240><c> because</c><00:15:10.639><c> like</c><00:15:10.800><c> we've</c><00:15:10.959><c> gotten</c><00:15:11.279><c> rusty</c>

00:15:11.750 --> 00:15:11.760 align:start position:0%
tell is because like we've gotten rusty
 

00:15:11.760 --> 00:15:12.629 align:start position:0%
tell is because like we've gotten rusty

00:15:35.030 --> 00:15:35.040 align:start position:0%
confidence so this is a great
 

00:15:35.040 --> 00:15:37.189 align:start position:0%
confidence so this is a great
question<00:15:35.759><c> because</c><00:15:36.240><c> that's</c><00:15:36.560><c> exactly</c><00:15:36.959><c> how</c><00:15:37.120><c> it</c>

00:15:37.199 --> 00:15:38.470 align:start position:0%
question because that's exactly how it
manifests

00:15:38.470 --> 00:15:38.480 align:start position:0%

so<00:15:38.800><c> you</c><00:15:38.959><c> don't</c><00:15:39.519><c> if</c><00:15:39.759><c> you</c><00:15:39.839><c> think</c><00:15:40.079><c> about</c><00:15:40.639><c> what</c><00:15:40.800><c> is</c>

00:15:40.949 --> 00:15:40.959 align:start position:0%

so<00:16:33.759><c> this</c><00:16:33.920><c> is</c><00:16:34.000><c> when</c><00:16:34.160><c> someone</c><00:16:34.480><c> says</c><00:16:34.959><c> so</c><00:16:35.360><c> it</c><00:16:35.519><c> will</c>

00:16:35.670 --> 00:16:35.680 align:start position:0%
so this is when someone says so it will
 

00:16:35.680 --> 00:16:37.110 align:start position:0%

00:16:37.110 --> 00:16:37.120 align:start position:0%
just get better i know it sounds
 

00:16:37.120 --> 00:16:37.990 align:start position:0%
just get better i know it sounds

00:16:42.629 --> 00:16:42.639 align:start position:0%
