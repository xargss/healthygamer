answer your question and then i'm going
to<00:07:13.440><c> share</c><00:07:13.680><c> one</c><00:07:13.840><c> or</c><00:07:14.000><c> two</c><00:07:14.160><c> principles</c><00:07:14.840><c> okay</c><00:07:15.840><c> so</c><00:07:16.000><c> i</c>

00:07:16.070 --> 00:07:16.080 align:start position:0%
to share one or two principles okay so i
 

00:07:16.080 --> 00:07:17.589 align:start position:0%
to share one or two principles okay so i
think<00:07:16.240><c> the</c><00:07:16.400><c> way</c><00:07:16.560><c> that</c><00:07:16.720><c> you</c><00:07:17.039><c> tell</c><00:07:17.280><c> them</c>

00:07:17.589 --> 00:07:17.599 align:start position:0%
think the way that you tell them
 

00:07:17.599 --> 00:07:20.390 align:start position:0%
think the way that you tell them
is<00:07:17.840><c> just</c><00:07:18.160><c> like</c><00:07:18.400><c> that</c><00:07:19.039><c> so</c><00:07:19.199><c> you</c><00:07:19.360><c> just</c><00:07:19.599><c> say</c><00:07:20.160><c> mom</c>

00:07:20.390 --> 00:07:20.400 align:start position:0%

right these are your parents thoughts
 

00:14:25.760 --> 00:14:27.350 align:start position:0%
right these are your parents thoughts
they're<00:14:25.920><c> not</c><00:14:26.160><c> actually</c><00:14:26.560><c> a</c><00:14:26.639><c> measure</c><00:14:27.040><c> of</c><00:14:27.120><c> your</c>

00:14:27.350 --> 00:14:27.360 align:start position:0%
they're not actually a measure of your
 

00:14:27.360 --> 00:14:29.189 align:start position:0%
they're not actually a measure of your
value<00:14:27.839><c> like</c><00:14:28.079><c> they're</c><00:14:28.320><c> not</c>

00:14:29.189 --> 00:14:29.199 align:start position:0%
value like they're not
 

00:14:29.199 --> 00:14:30.870 align:start position:0%
value like they're not
you<00:14:29.279><c> know</c><00:14:29.440><c> they're</c><00:14:29.600><c> not</c><00:14:29.839><c> true</c><00:14:30.399><c> they're</c><00:14:30.639><c> just</c>

00:14:30.870 --> 00:14:30.880 align:start position:0%
you know they're not true they're just
 

00:14:30.880 --> 00:14:32.710 align:start position:0%
you know they're not true they're just
like<00:14:31.120><c> echoes</c>

00:14:32.710 --> 00:14:32.720 align:start position:0%
like echoes
 

00:14:32.720 --> 00:14:34.629 align:start position:0%
like echoes
and<00:14:32.880><c> so</c><00:14:33.120><c> i</c><00:14:33.199><c> think</c><00:14:33.360><c> that</c><00:14:33.760><c> that</c><00:14:34.079><c> process</c><00:14:34.560><c> and</c>

00:14:34.629 --> 00:14:34.639 align:start position:0%
and so i think that that process and
 

00:14:34.639 --> 00:14:36.150 align:start position:0%
and so i think that that process and
this<00:14:34.800><c> is</c><00:14:34.959><c> where</c><00:14:35.279><c> you</c><00:14:35.360><c> know</c><00:14:35.440><c> if</c><00:14:35.600><c> we</c><00:14:35.680><c> want</c><00:14:35.839><c> to</c><00:14:35.920><c> be</c>

00:14:36.150 --> 00:14:36.160 align:start position:0%
this is where you know if we want to be
 

00:14:36.160 --> 00:14:38.310 align:start position:0%
this is where you know if we want to be
a<00:14:36.240><c> little</c><00:14:36.399><c> bit</c>

00:14:38.310 --> 00:14:38.320 align:start position:0%
a little bit
 

00:14:38.320 --> 00:14:41.350 align:start position:0%
a little bit
forgiving<00:14:40.160><c> so</c><00:14:40.320><c> i</c><00:14:40.399><c> think</c><00:14:40.560><c> one</c><00:14:40.800><c> way</c><00:14:40.959><c> to</c><00:14:41.120><c> move</c>

00:14:41.350 --> 00:14:41.360 align:start position:0%
forgiving so i think one way to move
 

00:14:41.360 --> 00:14:43.750 align:start position:0%
forgiving so i think one way to move
forward<00:14:41.680><c> here</c><00:14:42.000><c> is</c><00:14:42.160><c> to</c><00:14:42.320><c> forgive</c>

00:14:43.750 --> 00:14:43.760 align:start position:0%
forward here is to forgive
 

00:14:43.760 --> 00:14:45.430 align:start position:0%
forward here is to forgive
but<00:14:44.000><c> in</c><00:14:44.160><c> order</c><00:14:44.480><c> to</c><00:14:44.560><c> forgive</c><00:14:45.040><c> you</c><00:14:45.199><c> have</c><00:14:45.279><c> to</c>

00:14:45.430 --> 00:14:45.440 align:start position:0%
but in order to forgive you have to
 

00:14:45.440 --> 00:14:47.110 align:start position:0%
but in order to forgive you have to
blame<00:14:45.760><c> them</c><00:14:46.000><c> first</c>

00:14:47.110 --> 00:14:47.120 align:start position:0%
blame them first
 

00:14:47.120 --> 00:14:48.550 align:start position:0%
blame them first
right<00:14:47.360><c> and</c><00:14:47.440><c> this</c><00:14:47.600><c> is</c><00:14:47.680><c> where</c><00:14:47.839><c> the</c><00:14:48.000><c> tricky</c><00:14:48.320><c> part</c>

00:14:48.550 --> 00:14:48.560 align:start position:0%
right and this is where the tricky part
 

00:14:48.560 --> 00:14:50.230 align:start position:0%
right and this is where the tricky part
comes<00:14:48.800><c> in</c><00:14:48.959><c> whereas</c><00:14:49.279><c> like</c><00:14:49.519><c> if</c><00:14:49.680><c> you</c><00:14:49.839><c> can</c><00:14:50.000><c> never</c>

00:14:50.230 --> 00:14:50.240 align:start position:0%
comes in whereas like if you can never
 

00:14:50.240 --> 00:14:51.750 align:start position:0%
comes in whereas like if you can never
move<00:14:50.480><c> past</c><00:14:50.720><c> it</c><00:14:50.880><c> if</c><00:14:50.959><c> it's</c><00:14:51.120><c> not</c><00:14:51.360><c> like</c><00:14:51.519><c> if</c><00:14:51.680><c> you</c>

00:14:51.750 --> 00:14:51.760 align:start position:0%
move past it if it's not like if you
 

00:14:51.760 --> 00:14:52.870 align:start position:0%
move past it if it's not like if you
don't<00:14:51.920><c> blame</c><00:14:52.240><c> them</c>

00:14:52.870 --> 00:14:52.880 align:start position:0%
don't blame them
 

00:14:52.880 --> 00:14:55.110 align:start position:0%
don't blame them
you<00:14:53.040><c> can't</c><00:14:53.279><c> forgive</c><00:14:53.600><c> them</c><00:14:54.880><c> because</c><00:14:55.040><c> i</c>

00:14:55.110 --> 00:14:55.120 align:start position:0%
you can't forgive them because i
 

00:14:55.120 --> 00:14:56.550 align:start position:0%
you can't forgive them because i

00:14:56.550 --> 00:14:56.560 align:start position:0%
certainly did a number on you i think
 

00:14:56.560 --> 00:14:58.310 align:start position:0%
certainly did a number on you i think
everyone's<00:14:57.040><c> aware</c><00:14:57.279><c> of</c><00:14:57.360><c> that</c>

everyone's aware of that
 

00:14:58.320 --> 00:15:00.550 align:start position:0%
everyone's aware of that
yeah<00:14:59.120><c> and</c><00:14:59.519><c> and</c><00:14:59.680><c> so</c><00:14:59.920><c> i'm</c><00:15:00.000><c> not</c><00:15:00.160><c> saying</c><00:15:00.399><c> you</c><00:15:00.480><c> have</c>

00:15:38.710 --> 00:15:38.720 align:start position:0%
and you're kind of inconveniencing them
 

00:15:38.720 --> 00:15:40.629 align:start position:0%
and you're kind of inconveniencing them
by<00:15:38.959><c> having</c><00:15:39.279><c> it</c>

00:15:40.629 --> 00:15:40.639 align:start position:0%
by having it
 

00:15:40.639 --> 00:15:43.030 align:start position:0%

so there's all of that which is like a
some<00:15:43.279><c> scar</c><00:15:43.600><c> and</c><00:15:43.680><c> then</c><00:15:43.839><c> there's</c><00:15:44.160><c> also</c><00:15:44.720><c> the</c>

you and nothing to do with them it's
 

00:15:48.639 --> 00:15:50.550 align:start position:0%
you and nothing to do with them it's
just<00:15:48.880><c> if</c><00:15:48.959><c> they</c><00:15:49.120><c> haven't</c><00:15:49.440><c> learned</c><00:15:49.759><c> it</c>

00:15:50.550 --> 00:15:50.560 align:start position:0%
