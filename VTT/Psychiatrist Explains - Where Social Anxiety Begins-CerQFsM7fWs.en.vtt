00:04:23.670 --> 00:04:23.680 align:start position:0%
in bullying and then eventually how that

want to explain is something called the
 

00:04:28.000 --> 00:04:28.950 align:start position:0%
want to explain is something called the

the<00:04:29.120><c> amygdala</c><00:04:29.840><c> is</c><00:04:30.000><c> a</c><00:04:30.080><c> really</c><00:04:30.400><c> primitive</c>

00:04:30.870 --> 00:04:30.880 align:start position:0%
the amygdala is a really primitive

the amygdala is a really primitive
structure<00:04:31.280><c> in</c><00:04:31.440><c> our</c><00:04:31.600><c> brain</c><00:04:31.919><c> and</c>

00:04:32.230 --> 00:04:32.240 align:start position:0%
structure in our brain and
 

00:04:32.240 --> 00:04:34.070 align:start position:0%
structure in our brain and
what<00:04:32.400><c> primitive</c><00:04:32.880><c> means</c><00:04:33.199><c> is</c><00:04:33.360><c> that</c><00:04:33.520><c> it</c><00:04:33.600><c> serves</c><00:04:33.919><c> a</c>

00:04:34.070 --> 00:04:34.080 align:start position:0%
what primitive means is that it serves a
 

00:04:34.080 --> 00:04:35.590 align:start position:0%
what primitive means is that it serves a

00:04:35.590 --> 00:04:35.600 align:start position:0%
really basic

really basic
um<00:04:36.400><c> function</c><00:04:37.040><c> and</c><00:04:37.199><c> is</c><00:04:37.360><c> sort</c><00:04:37.520><c> of</c><00:04:38.080><c> even</c><00:04:38.400><c> in</c><00:04:38.479><c> like</c>

00:04:38.870 --> 00:04:38.880 align:start position:0%
um function and is sort of even in like
 

00:04:38.880 --> 00:04:40.629 align:start position:0%
um function and is sort of even in like
animals<00:04:39.360><c> and</c><00:04:39.440><c> stuff</c><00:04:39.680><c> the</c><00:04:39.840><c> amygdala</c><00:04:40.320><c> is</c><00:04:40.479><c> pretty</c>

00:04:40.629 --> 00:04:40.639 align:start position:0%
animals and stuff the amygdala is pretty
 

00:04:40.639 --> 00:04:42.550 align:start position:0%
animals and stuff the amygdala is pretty
much<00:04:41.120><c> the</c><00:04:41.280><c> same</c>

much the same
 

00:04:42.560 --> 00:04:44.950 align:start position:0%

so<00:04:42.800><c> the</c><00:04:42.880><c> amygdala</c><00:04:43.520><c> is</c><00:04:43.680><c> our</c><00:04:43.919><c> fear</c><00:04:44.240><c> and</c><00:04:44.400><c> survival</c>

00:04:44.950 --> 00:04:44.960 align:start position:0%
so the amygdala is our fear and survival

it activates his limbic system it
 

00:10:54.320 --> 00:10:56.230 align:start position:0%
it activates his limbic system it

activates his sympathetic nervous system
 

00:10:56.240 --> 00:10:58.790 align:start position:0%
activates his sympathetic nervous system
he<00:10:56.480><c> starts</c><00:10:56.800><c> to</c><00:10:57.200><c> get</c><00:10:57.519><c> flushed</c><00:10:57.920><c> with</c><00:10:58.079><c> adrenaline</c>

he starts to get flushed with adrenaline
 

00:10:58.800 --> 00:10:59.990 align:start position:0%
he starts to get flushed with adrenaline

we think about this for a second
 

00:11:03.839 --> 00:11:05.670 align:start position:0%
we think about this for a second
we'd<00:11:04.079><c> think</c><00:11:04.320><c> like</c><00:11:04.480><c> oh</c><00:11:04.720><c> this</c><00:11:04.959><c> is</c><00:11:05.279><c> social</c>

00:11:10.000 --> 00:11:11.990 align:start position:0%
right but if we really pay attention
what<00:11:10.160><c> we</c><00:11:10.320><c> discover</c><00:11:11.360><c> is</c><00:11:11.519><c> that</c>

00:11:11.990 --> 00:11:12.000 align:start position:0%
what we discover is that
 

00:11:12.000 --> 00:11:14.550 align:start position:0%
what we discover is that
this<00:11:12.240><c> isn't</c><00:11:12.480><c> his</c><00:11:12.720><c> brain</c><00:11:13.040><c> malfunctioning</c><00:11:14.320><c> this</c>

00:11:18.949 --> 00:11:18.959 align:start position:0%
to this is his brain

00:11:25.829 --> 00:11:25.839 align:start position:0%
and so what what happens is each time he
 

00:11:25.839 --> 00:11:27.110 align:start position:0%
and so what what happens is each time he
kind<00:11:26.000><c> of</c><00:11:26.160><c> goes</c><00:11:26.399><c> into</c><00:11:26.560><c> these</c><00:11:26.720><c> social</c>

00:11:30.150 --> 00:11:30.160 align:start position:0%
there are signals in his brain telling
 

00:11:30.160 --> 00:11:32.389 align:start position:0%
there are signals in his brain telling

brain and learn something new
 

00:15:03.519 --> 00:15:05.189 align:start position:0%
brain and learn something new
right<00:15:03.760><c> it's</c><00:15:04.000><c> really</c><00:15:04.240><c> hard</c><00:15:04.480><c> to</c><00:15:04.639><c> move</c><00:15:04.800><c> forward</c>

right it's really hard to move forward
 

00:15:05.199 --> 00:15:07.269 align:start position:0%
right it's really hard to move forward
in<00:15:05.279><c> life</c><00:15:05.760><c> when</c><00:15:06.000><c> all</c><00:15:06.240><c> you</c><00:15:06.399><c> feel</c><00:15:06.720><c> is</c><00:15:06.800><c> like</c><00:15:06.959><c> shame</c>

00:15:07.269 --> 00:15:07.279 align:start position:0%
in life when all you feel is like shame
 

00:15:07.279 --> 00:15:08.710 align:start position:0%
in life when all you feel is like shame
and<00:15:07.360><c> frustration</c><00:15:07.920><c> with</c><00:15:08.000><c> yourself</c>

00:15:08.710 --> 00:15:08.720 align:start position:0%
and frustration with yourself
 

00:15:08.720 --> 00:15:10.310 align:start position:0%
and frustration with yourself
so<00:15:08.880><c> the</c><00:15:09.040><c> first</c><00:15:09.199><c> thing</c><00:15:09.440><c> is</c><00:15:09.600><c> to</c><00:15:09.760><c> explain</c><00:15:10.079><c> to</c><00:15:10.160><c> him</c>

00:15:10.310 --> 00:15:10.320 align:start position:0%
so the first thing is to explain to him
 

00:15:10.320 --> 00:15:11.910 align:start position:0%
so the first thing is to explain to him
hey<00:15:10.480><c> man</c><00:15:10.720><c> like</c><00:15:10.880><c> you're</c><00:15:11.040><c> not</c><00:15:11.199><c> busted</c><00:15:11.600><c> you</c><00:15:11.760><c> can</c>

00:15:11.910 --> 00:15:11.920 align:start position:0%
hey man like you're not busted you can
 

00:15:11.920 --> 00:15:13.269 align:start position:0%
hey man like you're not busted you can
actually<00:15:12.240><c> change</c><00:15:12.560><c> this</c>

00:15:13.269 --> 00:15:13.279 align:start position:0%
actually change this
 

00:15:13.279 --> 00:15:14.870 align:start position:0%
actually change this
it's<00:15:13.600><c> just</c><00:15:13.839><c> this</c><00:15:14.000><c> is</c><00:15:14.079><c> what</c><00:15:14.320><c> happened</c><00:15:14.639><c> to</c><00:15:14.720><c> you</c>

00:15:14.870 --> 00:15:14.880 align:start position:0%
it's just this is what happened to you
 

00:15:14.880 --> 00:15:17.110 align:start position:0%
it's just this is what happened to you
and<00:15:14.959><c> this</c><00:15:15.199><c> is</c><00:15:15.519><c> how</c><00:15:15.680><c> your</c><00:15:15.920><c> brain</c><00:15:16.320><c> wired</c><00:15:16.800><c> because</c>

00:15:17.110 --> 00:15:17.120 align:start position:0%
and this is how your brain wired because
 

00:15:17.120 --> 00:15:19.430 align:start position:0%
and this is how your brain wired because
you<00:15:17.360><c> used</c><00:15:17.519><c> to</c><00:15:17.600><c> be</c><00:15:17.760><c> in</c><00:15:17.839><c> danger</c>

00:15:19.430 --> 00:15:19.440 align:start position:0%
you used to be in danger
 

00:15:19.440 --> 00:15:21.990 align:start position:0%
you used to be in danger
so<00:15:19.600><c> that</c><00:15:19.920><c> actually</c><00:15:20.320><c> helped</c><00:15:20.560><c> a</c><00:15:20.639><c> lot</c><00:15:21.199><c> the</c><00:15:21.440><c> second</c>

00:15:21.990 --> 00:15:22.000 align:start position:0%
so that actually helped a lot the second
 

00:15:22.000 --> 00:15:23.430 align:start position:0%
so that actually helped a lot the second
thing<00:15:22.160><c> that</c><00:15:22.320><c> we</c><00:15:22.399><c> did</c><00:15:22.639><c> is</c><00:15:22.720><c> we</c><00:15:22.880><c> taught</c><00:15:23.040><c> him</c><00:15:23.279><c> how</c>

00:15:23.430 --> 00:15:23.440 align:start position:0%
thing that we did is we taught him how
 

00:15:23.440 --> 00:15:25.509 align:start position:0%

sort of teaching him how to meditate in
 

00:15:27.120 --> 00:15:28.550 align:start position:0%

00:15:28.550 --> 00:15:28.560 align:start position:0%
and of itself
 

00:15:28.560 --> 00:15:31.509 align:start position:0%
and of itself
is<00:15:28.800><c> that</c><00:15:29.120><c> we</c><00:15:29.600><c> um</c><00:15:30.160><c> helped</c><00:15:30.480><c> him</c><00:15:30.800><c> notice</c><00:15:31.279><c> his</c>

00:15:31.509 --> 00:15:31.519 align:start position:0%
is that we um helped him notice his
 

00:15:31.519 --> 00:15:32.629 align:start position:0%
is that we um helped him notice his
reaction

00:15:32.629 --> 00:15:32.639 align:start position:0%
reaction
 

00:15:32.639 --> 00:15:34.790 align:start position:0%

and<00:15:32.800><c> so</c><00:15:32.959><c> what</c><00:15:33.120><c> he</c><00:15:33.279><c> was</c><00:15:33.440><c> able</c><00:15:33.680><c> to</c><00:15:33.839><c> do</c><00:15:34.240><c> is</c><00:15:34.480><c> like</c>

00:15:34.790 --> 00:15:34.800 align:start position:0%
