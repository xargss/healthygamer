there's like an exchange in
 

00:19:50.000 --> 00:19:51.430 align:start position:0%
there's like an exchange in

getting<00:19:51.679><c> much</c><00:19:52.000><c> of</c><00:19:52.640><c> the</c><00:19:52.799><c> interesting</c><00:19:53.120><c> thing</c><00:19:53.360><c> is</c>

00:19:53.430 --> 00:19:53.440 align:start position:0%
getting much of the interesting thing is
 

00:19:53.440 --> 00:19:54.950 align:start position:0%
getting much of the interesting thing is
that<00:19:53.520><c> i</c><00:19:53.679><c> think</c><00:19:53.760><c> that</c><00:19:53.919><c> this</c><00:19:54.080><c> person</c><00:19:54.400><c> does</c><00:19:54.720><c> do</c>

00:19:54.950 --> 00:19:54.960 align:start position:0%
that i think that this person does do
 

00:19:54.960 --> 00:19:56.230 align:start position:0%
that i think that this person does do
this

00:19:56.230 --> 00:19:56.240 align:start position:0%
this
 

00:19:56.240 --> 00:19:57.669 align:start position:0%
this
so

00:19:57.669 --> 00:19:57.679 align:start position:0%
so
 

00:19:57.679 --> 00:19:58.870 align:start position:0%
so
it's<00:19:57.840><c> kind</c><00:19:58.000><c> of</c><00:19:58.160><c> interesting</c><00:19:58.400><c> because</c><00:19:58.559><c> if</c><00:19:58.720><c> you</c>

00:19:58.870 --> 00:19:58.880 align:start position:0%
it's kind of interesting because if you
 

00:19:58.880 --> 00:20:00.710 align:start position:0%
it's kind of interesting because if you
really<00:19:59.120><c> talk</c><00:19:59.360><c> about</c><00:19:59.520><c> this</c><00:19:59.760><c> example</c><00:20:00.240><c> like</c><00:20:00.480><c> good</c>

think this conditioning and all this
 

00:20:13.919 --> 00:20:15.430 align:start position:0%
think this conditioning and all this
other<00:20:14.080><c> crap</c><00:20:14.320><c> gets</c><00:20:14.559><c> in</c><00:20:14.640><c> the</c><00:20:14.720><c> way</c><00:20:14.960><c> so</c><00:20:15.120><c> the</c><00:20:15.200><c> right</c>

and<00:20:35.520><c> then</c><00:20:35.600><c> we</c><00:20:35.760><c> kind</c><00:20:35.919><c> of</c><00:20:36.000><c> get</c><00:20:36.159><c> to</c><00:20:36.240><c> the</c><00:20:36.320><c> last</c>

we try to

00:21:03.440 --> 00:21:06.149 align:start position:0%

so this is kind of related to
 

00:21:06.159 --> 00:21:07.350 align:start position:0%
so this is kind of related to
um

00:21:07.350 --> 00:21:07.360 align:start position:0%
um

but if i am impulsive and
 

00:21:16.320 --> 00:21:17.669 align:start position:0%
but if i am impulsive and
you<00:21:16.400><c> know</c><00:21:16.559><c> like</c>

00:21:17.669 --> 00:21:17.679 align:start position:0%
you know like

and vulnerable to alcoholism
 

00:21:22.000 --> 00:21:24.710 align:start position:0%
and vulnerable to alcoholism
then<00:21:22.799><c> i</c><00:21:22.960><c> think</c><00:21:23.200><c> i</c><00:21:23.280><c> can</c><00:21:23.520><c> fix</c><00:21:23.840><c> that</c><00:21:24.240><c> by</c>

00:21:24.710 --> 00:21:24.720 align:start position:0%
then i think i can fix that by
 

00:21:24.720 --> 00:21:26.470 align:start position:0%
then i think i can fix that by

00:30:40.389 --> 00:30:40.399 align:start position:0%
is like
 

00:30:40.399 --> 00:30:42.149 align:start position:0%
is like

00:30:42.149 --> 00:30:42.159 align:start position:0%
through the roof
 

00:30:42.159 --> 00:30:44.070 align:start position:0%
through the roof
you're<00:30:42.399><c> tachycardic</c><00:30:43.279><c> and</c><00:30:43.360><c> you're</c><00:30:43.600><c> sweating</c>

00:30:44.070 --> 00:30:44.080 align:start position:0%
you're tachycardic and you're sweating
 

00:30:44.080 --> 00:30:45.430 align:start position:0%
you're tachycardic and you're sweating
and<00:30:44.240><c> you're</c><00:30:44.399><c> just</c><00:30:44.559><c> like</c><00:30:44.720><c> trying</c><00:30:44.960><c> to</c><00:30:45.039><c> get</c><00:30:45.200><c> into</c>

00:30:45.430 --> 00:30:45.440 align:start position:0%
and you're just like trying to get into
 

00:30:45.440 --> 00:30:48.630 align:start position:0%
and you're just like trying to get into
a<00:30:45.520><c> car</c><00:30:45.840><c> like</c><00:30:46.000><c> what's</c><00:30:46.480><c> wrong</c><00:30:46.880><c> here</c>

00:30:48.630 --> 00:30:48.640 align:start position:0%
a car like what's wrong here
 

00:30:48.640 --> 00:30:50.789 align:start position:0%
a car like what's wrong here
and<00:30:48.720><c> then</c><00:30:48.960><c> you</c><00:30:49.120><c> realize</c><00:30:49.679><c> like</c><00:30:50.159><c> something</c><00:30:50.559><c> is</c>

00:30:50.789 --> 00:30:50.799 align:start position:0%
and then you realize like something is
 

00:30:50.799 --> 00:30:53.269 align:start position:0%
and then you realize like something is
up

00:30:53.269 --> 00:30:53.279 align:start position:0%
 
 

00:30:53.279 --> 00:30:55.110 align:start position:0%
 
right<00:30:53.440><c> so</c><00:30:53.760><c> awareness</c><00:30:54.320><c> of</c><00:30:54.399><c> conditioning</c><00:30:54.960><c> is</c>

00:30:55.110 --> 00:30:55.120 align:start position:0%
right so awareness of conditioning is
 

00:30:55.120 --> 00:30:56.870 align:start position:0%
right so awareness of conditioning is
critical<00:30:55.600><c> and</c><00:30:55.679><c> then</c><00:30:56.000><c> once</c><00:30:56.240><c> you</c><00:30:56.320><c> become</c><00:30:56.559><c> aware</c>

00:30:56.870 --> 00:30:56.880 align:start position:0%
critical and then once you become aware
 

00:30:56.880 --> 00:30:58.389 align:start position:0%
critical and then once you become aware
of<00:30:57.039><c> it</c><00:30:57.120><c> then</c><00:30:57.279><c> you</c><00:30:57.360><c> can</c><00:30:57.519><c> sort</c><00:30:57.679><c> of</c><00:30:57.840><c> realize</c><00:30:58.240><c> like</c>

00:30:58.389 --> 00:30:58.399 align:start position:0%
of it then you can sort of realize like
 

00:30:58.399 --> 00:31:01.110 align:start position:0%
of it then you can sort of realize like
oh<00:30:59.120><c> this</c><00:30:59.360><c> is</c><00:30:59.519><c> me</c><00:30:59.760><c> being</c><00:31:00.080><c> afraid</c><00:31:00.559><c> that</c><00:31:00.720><c> like</c><00:31:00.960><c> i'm</c>

00:31:01.110 --> 00:31:01.120 align:start position:0%
oh this is me being afraid that like i'm

00:31:09.430 --> 00:31:09.440 align:start position:0%
are you can say yes like that fear is
 

00:31:09.440 --> 00:31:13.430 align:start position:0%
are you can say yes like that fear is
too<00:31:09.600><c> much</c><00:31:09.840><c> right</c><00:31:10.080><c> now</c><00:31:10.559><c> so</c><00:31:10.799><c> be</c><00:31:10.960><c> it</c>

00:31:13.430 --> 00:31:13.440 align:start position:0%
 
 

00:31:13.440 --> 00:31:15.430 align:start position:0%
 
or<00:31:13.840><c> i'm</c><00:31:14.080><c> gonna</c><00:31:14.240><c> set</c><00:31:14.399><c> that</c><00:31:14.559><c> fear</c><00:31:14.799><c> aside</c><00:31:15.120><c> and</c><00:31:15.279><c> i'm</c>

00:31:15.430 --> 00:31:15.440 align:start position:0%
or i'm gonna set that fear aside and i'm
 

00:31:15.440 --> 00:31:18.630 align:start position:0%
or i'm gonna set that fear aside and i'm
gonna<00:31:15.600><c> try</c><00:31:15.840><c> to</c><00:31:15.919><c> go</c>

00:31:18.630 --> 00:31:18.640 align:start position:0%
gonna try to go
 

00:31:18.640 --> 00:31:20.389 align:start position:0%
gonna try to go
right<00:31:18.880><c> and</c><00:31:18.960><c> then</c><00:31:19.120><c> you</c><00:31:19.360><c> start</c><00:31:19.600><c> to</c><00:31:19.840><c> condition</c>

00:31:20.389 --> 00:31:20.399 align:start position:0%
right and then you start to condition
 

00:31:20.399 --> 00:31:22.870 align:start position:0%
right and then you start to condition
yourself<00:31:20.880><c> in</c><00:31:21.039><c> other</c><00:31:21.279><c> ways</c>

00:31:22.870 --> 00:31:22.880 align:start position:0%
yourself in other ways
 

00:31:22.880 --> 00:31:25.269 align:start position:0%
yourself in other ways
so<00:31:23.120><c> neurons</c><00:31:23.600><c> that</c>

00:31:25.269 --> 00:31:25.279 align:start position:0%
so neurons that
 

00:31:25.279 --> 00:31:27.990 align:start position:0%
so neurons that
fire<00:31:25.760><c> repeatedly</c><00:31:26.559><c> get</c><00:31:26.799><c> well</c><00:31:27.200><c> grooved</c><00:31:27.840><c> right</c>

00:31:27.990 --> 00:31:28.000 align:start position:0%
fire repeatedly get well grooved right
 

00:31:28.000 --> 00:31:29.110 align:start position:0%
fire repeatedly get well grooved right
so<00:31:28.159><c> if</c><00:31:28.240><c> we</c><00:31:28.320><c> want</c><00:31:28.480><c> to</c><00:31:28.559><c> understand</c><00:31:28.880><c> how</c>

00:31:29.110 --> 00:31:29.120 align:start position:0%
so if we want to understand how
 

00:31:29.120 --> 00:31:30.630 align:start position:0%
so if we want to understand how
conditioning<00:31:29.600><c> works</c>

00:31:30.630 --> 00:31:30.640 align:start position:0%
conditioning works
 

00:31:30.640 --> 00:31:32.789 align:start position:0%
conditioning works
it's<00:31:30.880><c> kind</c><00:31:31.039><c> of</c><00:31:31.120><c> like</c><00:31:31.279><c> a</c><00:31:31.440><c> game</c><00:31:31.840><c> trail</c><00:31:32.559><c> in</c><00:31:32.720><c> the</c>

00:31:32.789 --> 00:31:32.799 align:start position:0%
it's kind of like a game trail in the
 

00:31:32.799 --> 00:31:34.070 align:start position:0%
it's kind of like a game trail in the
wilderness

00:31:34.070 --> 00:31:34.080 align:start position:0%
wilderness
 

00:31:34.080 --> 00:31:35.990 align:start position:0%
wilderness
so<00:31:34.240><c> it</c><00:31:34.399><c> starts</c><00:31:34.640><c> off</c><00:31:34.799><c> with</c><00:31:34.960><c> a</c><00:31:35.120><c> field</c><00:31:35.440><c> of</c><00:31:35.600><c> grass</c>

00:31:35.990 --> 00:31:36.000 align:start position:0%
so it starts off with a field of grass
 

00:31:36.000 --> 00:31:39.509 align:start position:0%
so it starts off with a field of grass
that<00:31:36.240><c> is</c><00:31:36.799><c> equally</c><00:31:37.679><c> is</c><00:31:37.840><c> all</c><00:31:38.000><c> the</c><00:31:38.159><c> same</c>

00:31:39.509 --> 00:31:39.519 align:start position:0%
that is equally is all the same
 

00:31:39.519 --> 00:31:40.789 align:start position:0%
that is equally is all the same
then<00:31:39.760><c> a</c><00:31:39.919><c> mouse</c>

00:31:40.789 --> 00:31:40.799 align:start position:0%
then a mouse
 

00:31:40.799 --> 00:31:43.029 align:start position:0%
then a mouse
runs<00:31:41.200><c> through</c><00:31:41.440><c> the</c><00:31:41.519><c> field</c><00:31:42.240><c> and</c><00:31:42.399><c> tramples</c><00:31:42.880><c> a</c>

00:31:43.029 --> 00:31:43.039 align:start position:0%
runs through the field and tramples a
 

00:31:43.039 --> 00:31:44.630 align:start position:0%
runs through the field and tramples a
little<00:31:43.279><c> bit</c><00:31:43.440><c> of</c><00:31:43.519><c> grass</c>

00:31:44.630 --> 00:31:44.640 align:start position:0%
little bit of grass
 

00:31:44.640 --> 00:31:46.789 align:start position:0%
little bit of grass
and<00:31:44.720><c> then</c><00:31:44.880><c> what</c><00:31:45.120><c> happens</c><00:31:45.440><c> is</c><00:31:45.600><c> a</c><00:31:45.760><c> rabbit</c><00:31:46.399><c> is</c>

00:31:46.789 --> 00:31:46.799 align:start position:0%
and then what happens is a rabbit is
 

00:31:46.799 --> 00:31:48.230 align:start position:0%
and then what happens is a rabbit is
approaches<00:31:47.279><c> the</c><00:31:47.360><c> field</c><00:31:47.600><c> and</c><00:31:47.760><c> sees</c><00:31:48.000><c> oh</c><00:31:48.080><c> there's</c>

00:31:48.230 --> 00:31:48.240 align:start position:0%
approaches the field and sees oh there's
 

00:31:48.240 --> 00:31:50.070 align:start position:0%
approaches the field and sees oh there's
one<00:31:48.399><c> area</c><00:31:48.640><c> where</c><00:31:48.799><c> the</c><00:31:48.880><c> grass</c><00:31:49.200><c> is</c><00:31:49.360><c> a</c><00:31:49.440><c> little</c><00:31:49.600><c> bit</c>

00:31:50.070 --> 00:31:50.080 align:start position:0%
one area where the grass is a little bit
 

00:31:50.080 --> 00:31:51.990 align:start position:0%
one area where the grass is a little bit
trampled<00:31:50.799><c> so</c><00:31:50.960><c> the</c><00:31:51.039><c> rabbit</c><00:31:51.360><c> runs</c><00:31:51.600><c> across</c><00:31:51.840><c> the</c>

00:31:51.990 --> 00:31:52.000 align:start position:0%
trampled so the rabbit runs across the
 

00:31:52.000 --> 00:31:53.669 align:start position:0%
trampled so the rabbit runs across the
field<00:31:52.559><c> rabbit's</c><00:31:52.880><c> bigger</c><00:31:53.120><c> than</c><00:31:53.200><c> a</c><00:31:53.279><c> mouse</c><00:31:53.440><c> so</c><00:31:53.519><c> it</c>

00:31:53.669 --> 00:31:53.679 align:start position:0%
field rabbit's bigger than a mouse so it
 

00:31:53.679 --> 00:31:56.470 align:start position:0%
field rabbit's bigger than a mouse so it
tramples<00:31:54.000><c> a</c><00:31:54.080><c> little</c><00:31:54.240><c> bit</c><00:31:54.320><c> more</c><00:31:54.640><c> grass</c>

00:31:56.470 --> 00:31:56.480 align:start position:0%
tramples a little bit more grass
 

00:31:56.480 --> 00:31:58.310 align:start position:0%
tramples a little bit more grass
and<00:31:56.640><c> then</c><00:31:56.720><c> there's</c><00:31:56.960><c> something</c><00:31:57.200><c> like</c><00:31:57.440><c> a</c>

00:31:58.310 --> 00:31:58.320 align:start position:0%
and then there's something like a
 

00:31:58.320 --> 00:32:00.470 align:start position:0%
and then there's something like a
you<00:31:58.480><c> know</c><00:31:58.559><c> like</c><00:31:58.720><c> a</c><00:31:58.880><c> small</c><00:31:59.279><c> deer</c>

00:32:00.470 --> 00:32:00.480 align:start position:0%
you know like a small deer
 

00:32:00.480 --> 00:32:02.230 align:start position:0%
you know like a small deer
that<00:32:00.720><c> walks</c><00:32:01.039><c> across</c><00:32:01.360><c> it</c><00:32:01.600><c> because</c><00:32:01.760><c> it</c><00:32:01.840><c> sees</c><00:32:02.080><c> an</c>

00:32:02.230 --> 00:32:02.240 align:start position:0%

00:32:27.990 --> 00:32:28.000 align:start position:0%
right so when you start to think in a

right so when you start to think in a

00:32:29.669 --> 00:32:29.679 align:start position:0%
particular way all those neurons will
 

00:32:29.679 --> 00:32:31.430 align:start position:0%
particular way all those neurons will
get<00:32:29.840><c> connected</c><00:32:30.559><c> and</c><00:32:30.640><c> then</c><00:32:30.880><c> all</c><00:32:31.039><c> you</c><00:32:31.200><c> have</c><00:32:31.279><c> to</c>

00:32:31.430 --> 00:32:31.440 align:start position:0%
get connected and then all you have to
 

00:32:31.440 --> 00:32:33.110 align:start position:0%
get connected and then all you have to
do<00:32:31.600><c> is</c><00:32:31.760><c> trigger</c><00:32:32.159><c> one</c><00:32:32.399><c> neuron</c><00:32:32.799><c> and</c><00:32:32.880><c> it'll</c>

00:32:33.110 --> 00:32:33.120 align:start position:0%
do is trigger one neuron and it'll
 

00:32:33.120 --> 00:32:38.149 align:start position:0%
do is trigger one neuron and it'll
trigger<00:32:33.440><c> everything</c><00:32:33.840><c> down</c><00:32:34.080><c> the</c><00:32:34.159><c> path</c>

00:32:38.159 --> 00:32:40.149 align:start position:0%
 
so<00:32:38.320><c> how</c><00:32:38.480><c> do</c><00:32:38.559><c> you</c><00:32:38.720><c> start</c><00:32:38.960><c> to</c><00:32:39.519><c> do</c><00:32:39.679><c> that</c><00:32:39.840><c> it's</c><00:32:40.000><c> the</c>

00:32:40.149 --> 00:32:40.159 align:start position:0%
so how do you start to do that it's the
 

00:32:40.159 --> 00:32:42.870 align:start position:0%
so how do you start to do that it's the
same<00:32:40.320><c> way</c><00:32:40.480><c> you</c><00:32:40.559><c> make</c><00:32:40.720><c> a</c><00:32:40.799><c> new</c><00:32:41.039><c> game</c><00:32:41.279><c> trail</c><00:32:42.320><c> so</c><00:32:42.720><c> in</c>

00:32:42.870 --> 00:32:42.880 align:start position:0%
same way you make a new game trail so in
 

00:32:42.880 --> 00:32:45.110 align:start position:0%
same way you make a new game trail so in
a<00:32:42.960><c> given</c><00:32:43.279><c> moment</c><00:32:43.679><c> in</c><00:32:43.840><c> your</c><00:32:44.000><c> life</c><00:32:44.799><c> there's</c>

00:32:45.110 --> 00:32:45.120 align:start position:0%
a given moment in your life there's
 

00:32:45.120 --> 00:32:46.710 align:start position:0%
a given moment in your life there's

gonna be an easy path which you've

00:32:51.350 --> 00:32:51.360 align:start position:0%

00:32:51.360 --> 00:32:52.870 align:start position:0%
or there's a hard path
you<00:32:51.519><c> have</c><00:32:51.600><c> to</c><00:32:51.760><c> walk</c><00:32:52.000><c> through</c><00:32:52.240><c> the</c><00:32:52.320><c> grass</c><00:32:52.799><c> and</c>

00:32:52.870 --> 00:32:52.880 align:start position:0%
you have to walk through the grass and
 

00:32:52.880 --> 00:32:54.549 align:start position:0%
you have to walk through the grass and
that's<00:32:53.120><c> gonna</c><00:32:53.279><c> require</c><00:32:53.760><c> more</c><00:32:54.080><c> energy</c><00:32:54.399><c> it's</c>

00:32:54.549 --> 00:32:54.559 align:start position:0%
that's gonna require more energy it's
 

00:32:54.559 --> 00:32:57.830 align:start position:0%
that's gonna require more energy it's

00:32:57.840 --> 00:32:59.590 align:start position:0%

you recognize that right that's like

you're going to go to the philosophy
 

00:33:02.240 --> 00:33:03.669 align:start position:0%
you're going to go to the philosophy
