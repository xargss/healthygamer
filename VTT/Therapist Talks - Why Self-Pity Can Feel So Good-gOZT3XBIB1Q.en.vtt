also<00:01:27.920><c> feels</c><00:01:28.320><c> good</c>

00:01:29.590 --> 00:01:29.600 align:start position:0%
also feels good
 

00:01:29.600 --> 00:01:31.590 align:start position:0%
also feels good
and<00:01:29.840><c> sometimes</c><00:01:30.400><c> i</c><00:01:30.560><c> fight</c><00:01:30.880><c> it</c><00:01:31.040><c> but</c><00:01:31.200><c> when</c><00:01:31.360><c> i</c>

00:01:31.590 --> 00:01:31.600 align:start position:0%

00:01:32.710 --> 00:01:32.720 align:start position:0%
fight it
 

00:01:32.720 --> 00:01:33.910 align:start position:0%
fight it
it<00:01:32.960><c> hurts</c>

00:01:33.910 --> 00:01:33.920 align:start position:0%
it hurts
 

00:01:33.920 --> 00:01:36.550 align:start position:0%
it hurts
like<00:01:34.079><c> what's</c><00:01:34.400><c> up</c><00:01:34.560><c> with</c><00:01:34.720><c> that</c><00:01:35.200><c> okay</c>

00:01:36.550 --> 00:01:36.560 align:start position:0%
like what's up with that okay
 

00:01:36.560 --> 00:01:38.069 align:start position:0%
like what's up with that okay
there's<00:01:36.799><c> a</c><00:01:36.799><c> lot</c><00:01:37.040><c> of</c><00:01:37.119><c> really</c><00:01:37.360><c> good</c><00:01:37.520><c> stuff</c><00:01:37.840><c> here</c>

00:01:38.069 --> 00:01:38.079 align:start position:0%
there's a lot of really good stuff here
 

00:01:38.079 --> 00:01:40.710 align:start position:0%
there's a lot of really good stuff here
so<00:01:38.240><c> let's</c><00:01:38.479><c> start</c><00:01:38.720><c> at</c><00:01:38.799><c> the</c><00:01:38.880><c> top</c>

00:01:40.710 --> 00:01:40.720 align:start position:0%
so let's start at the top
 

00:01:40.720 --> 00:01:43.270 align:start position:0%
so let's start at the top
the<00:01:40.960><c> first</c><00:01:41.280><c> thing</c><00:01:41.759><c> is</c><00:01:41.920><c> that</c><00:01:42.079><c> our</c><00:01:42.320><c> brain</c><00:01:42.799><c> is</c><00:01:42.960><c> not</c>

00:01:43.270 --> 00:01:43.280 align:start position:0%
the first thing is that our brain is not
 

00:01:43.280 --> 00:01:45.670 align:start position:0%
the first thing is that our brain is not
designed<00:01:43.840><c> to</c>

00:01:45.670 --> 00:01:45.680 align:start position:0%
designed to
 

00:01:45.680 --> 00:01:48.069 align:start position:0%
designed to
feel<00:01:46.079><c> good</c><00:01:46.720><c> it's</c><00:01:47.040><c> designed</c><00:01:47.520><c> to</c><00:01:47.759><c> like</c>

00:01:48.069 --> 00:01:48.079 align:start position:0%
feel good it's designed to like
 

00:01:48.079 --> 00:01:50.710 align:start position:0%
feel good it's designed to like
understand<00:01:48.880><c> things</c><00:01:49.360><c> and</c><00:01:49.600><c> like</c><00:01:49.920><c> put</c><00:01:50.159><c> things</c><00:01:50.479><c> in</c>

00:01:50.710 --> 00:01:50.720 align:start position:0%
understand things and like put things in
 

00:01:50.720 --> 00:01:53.350 align:start position:0%
understand things and like put things in
order<00:01:51.280><c> okay</c><00:01:52.079><c> so</c><00:01:52.320><c> what</c><00:01:52.560><c> i</c><00:01:52.640><c> mean</c><00:01:52.880><c> by</c><00:01:53.040><c> that</c><00:01:53.280><c> is</c>

00:01:53.350 --> 00:01:53.360 align:start position:0%
order okay so what i mean by that is
 

00:01:53.360 --> 00:01:57.270 align:start position:0%
order okay so what i mean by that is
that<00:01:53.600><c> like</c><00:01:53.920><c> the</c><00:01:54.079><c> brain</c><00:01:54.720><c> seeks</c><00:01:55.280><c> to</c><00:01:55.920><c> bring</c>

00:01:57.270 --> 00:01:57.280 align:start position:0%
that like the brain seeks to bring
 

00:01:57.280 --> 00:02:00.310 align:start position:0%
that like the brain seeks to bring
order<00:01:57.920><c> from</c><00:01:58.240><c> chaos</c><00:01:59.200><c> it's</c><00:01:59.520><c> all</c><00:01:59.759><c> about</c><00:02:00.079><c> like</c>

00:02:00.310 --> 00:02:00.320 align:start position:0%
order from chaos it's all about like
 

00:02:00.320 --> 00:02:02.149 align:start position:0%
order from chaos it's all about like
generating<00:02:01.040><c> patterns</c><00:02:01.520><c> so</c><00:02:01.680><c> that</c><00:02:01.759><c> we</c><00:02:01.920><c> can</c>

00:02:02.149 --> 00:02:02.159 align:start position:0%
generating patterns so that we can
 

00:02:02.159 --> 00:02:05.270 align:start position:0%
generating patterns so that we can
understand<00:02:02.719><c> and</c><00:02:02.880><c> make</c><00:02:03.040><c> sense</c><00:02:03.360><c> of</c><00:02:03.439><c> the</c><00:02:03.520><c> world</c>

00:02:05.270 --> 00:02:05.280 align:start position:0%
understand and make sense of the world
 

00:02:05.280 --> 00:02:08.229 align:start position:0%
understand and make sense of the world
the<00:02:05.439><c> brain</c><00:02:05.840><c> would</c><00:02:06.079><c> rather</c><00:02:06.640><c> generate</c><00:02:07.520><c> a</c><00:02:07.759><c> bad</c>

00:02:08.229 --> 00:02:08.239 align:start position:0%
the brain would rather generate a bad
 

00:02:08.239 --> 00:02:10.630 align:start position:0%
the brain would rather generate a bad
pattern<00:02:08.720><c> that</c><00:02:08.879><c> makes</c><00:02:09.200><c> us</c><00:02:09.360><c> feel</c><00:02:09.759><c> bad</c><00:02:10.319><c> rather</c>

00:02:10.630 --> 00:02:10.640 align:start position:0%
pattern that makes us feel bad rather
 

00:02:10.640 --> 00:02:13.110 align:start position:0%
pattern that makes us feel bad rather
than<00:02:10.959><c> have</c><00:02:11.280><c> chaos</c><00:02:11.760><c> and</c><00:02:11.840><c> confusion</c><00:02:12.640><c> okay</c><00:02:12.879><c> this</c>

00:02:13.110 --> 00:02:13.120 align:start position:0%
than have chaos and confusion okay this
 

00:02:13.120 --> 00:02:14.309 align:start position:0%
than have chaos and confusion okay this
is<00:02:13.200><c> a</c><00:02:13.360><c> really</c><00:02:13.680><c> important</c><00:02:14.000><c> thing</c><00:02:14.160><c> to</c>

00:02:14.309 --> 00:02:14.319 align:start position:0%
is a really important thing to
 

00:02:14.319 --> 00:02:15.750 align:start position:0%
is a really important thing to
understand

00:02:15.750 --> 00:02:15.760 align:start position:0%
understand
 

00:02:15.760 --> 00:02:17.830 align:start position:0%
understand
so<00:02:16.000><c> if</c><00:02:16.080><c> you</c><00:02:16.160><c> look</c><00:02:16.400><c> at</c><00:02:16.560><c> people</c><00:02:17.120><c> who</c><00:02:17.280><c> get</c><00:02:17.520><c> into</c>

00:02:17.830 --> 00:02:17.840 align:start position:0%
so if you look at people who get into
 

00:02:17.840 --> 00:02:20.229 align:start position:0%
so if you look at people who get into
abusive<00:02:18.319><c> relationships</c><00:02:19.200><c> over</c><00:02:19.520><c> and</c><00:02:19.760><c> over</c><00:02:20.000><c> and</c>

over again like why on earth do they do
 

00:02:22.160 --> 00:02:23.910 align:start position:0%
over again like why on earth do they do
this<00:02:22.560><c> okay</c><00:02:22.959><c> it's</c><00:02:23.200><c> really</c><00:02:23.599><c> it's</c><00:02:23.760><c> an</c>
