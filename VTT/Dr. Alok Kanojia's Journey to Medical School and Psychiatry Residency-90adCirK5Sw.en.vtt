00:01:37.700 --> 00:01:41.470 align:start position:0%
happened as I entered the first grade is
like<00:01:38.060><c> a</c><00:01:38.090><c> five</c><00:01:38.450><c> year</c><00:01:38.660><c> old</c><00:01:38.810><c> and</c><00:01:39.490><c> a</c><00:01:40.490><c> six</c><00:01:41.210><c> year</c><00:01:41.420><c> old</c>

00:01:41.470 --> 00:01:41.480 align:start position:0%
like a five year old and a six year old
 

00:01:41.480 --> 00:01:43.990 align:start position:0%
like a five year old and a six year old
I<00:01:41.630><c> guess</c><00:01:41.810><c> a</c><00:01:42.220><c> second</c><00:01:43.220><c> grade</c><00:01:43.370><c> is</c><00:01:43.520><c> a</c><00:01:43.550><c> six</c><00:01:43.820><c> year</c><00:01:43.940><c> old</c>

00:01:43.990 --> 00:01:44.000 align:start position:0%
I guess a second grade is a six year old
 

00:01:44.000 --> 00:01:45.310 align:start position:0%
I guess a second grade is a six year old
or<00:01:44.180><c> something</c><00:01:44.420><c> with</c><00:01:44.510><c> that</c><00:01:44.660><c> I</c><00:01:44.690><c> was</c><00:01:44.900><c> one</c><00:01:45.080><c> year</c>

00:01:45.310 --> 00:01:45.320 align:start position:0%
or something with that I was one year
 

00:01:45.320 --> 00:01:47.010 align:start position:0%
or something with that I was one year
younger<00:01:45.530><c> than</c><00:01:45.740><c> than</c><00:01:46.250><c> all</c><00:01:46.400><c> of</c><00:01:46.520><c> my</c><00:01:46.550><c> classmates</c>

00:01:47.010 --> 00:01:47.020 align:start position:0%
younger than than all of my classmates
 

00:01:47.020 --> 00:01:49.240 align:start position:0%
younger than than all of my classmates
and<00:01:48.020><c> so</c><00:01:48.140><c> the</c><00:01:48.230><c> first</c><00:01:48.410><c> thing</c><00:01:48.560><c> that</c><00:01:48.680><c> happened</c><00:01:49.190><c> is</c>

00:01:49.240 --> 00:01:49.250 align:start position:0%
and so the first thing that happened is
 

00:01:49.250 --> 00:01:52.210 align:start position:0%
and so the first thing that happened is
I<00:01:49.370><c> sucked</c><00:01:49.700><c> at</c><00:01:49.850><c> sports</c><00:01:50.680><c> because</c><00:01:51.680><c> I</c><00:01:51.710><c> was</c><00:01:52.040><c> like</c><00:01:52.190><c> a</c>

00:01:52.210 --> 00:01:52.220 align:start position:0%
I sucked at sports because I was like a
 

00:01:52.220 --> 00:01:53.890 align:start position:0%
I sucked at sports because I was like a
five-year-old<00:01:52.850><c> competing</c><00:01:53.540><c> against</c>

00:01:53.890 --> 00:01:53.900 align:start position:0%
five-year-old competing against
 

00:01:53.900 --> 00:01:56.080 align:start position:0%
five-year-old competing against
six-year-olds<00:01:54.530><c> if</c><00:01:55.370><c> you</c><00:01:55.460><c> think</c><00:01:55.670><c> about</c><00:01:55.790><c> that</c>

00:01:56.080 --> 00:01:56.090 align:start position:0%
six-year-olds if you think about that
 

00:01:56.090 --> 00:01:58.960 align:start position:0%
six-year-olds if you think about that
like<00:01:56.300><c> a</c><00:01:56.540><c> five-year-old</c><00:01:57.260><c> is</c><00:01:57.530><c> just</c><00:01:57.740><c> not</c><00:01:58.250><c> gonna</c>

00:01:58.960 --> 00:01:58.970 align:start position:0%
like a five-year-old is just not gonna
 

00:01:58.970 --> 00:02:01.450 align:start position:0%
like a five-year-old is just not gonna
compete<00:01:59.450><c> on</c><00:01:59.660><c> any</c><00:02:00.050><c> level</c><00:02:00.350><c> with</c><00:02:00.890><c> six-year-olds</c>

00:02:01.450 --> 00:02:01.460 align:start position:0%
compete on any level with six-year-olds
 

00:02:01.460 --> 00:02:08.169 align:start position:0%
compete on any level with six-year-olds
and<00:02:03.760><c> so</c><00:02:04.760><c> I</c><00:02:04.790><c> think</c><00:02:05.000><c> that</c><00:02:06.430><c> you</c><00:02:07.430><c> know</c><00:02:07.520><c> what</c><00:02:07.700><c> what</c>

00:02:08.169 --> 00:02:08.179 align:start position:0%
and so I think that you know what what
 

00:02:08.179 --> 00:02:09.910 align:start position:0%
and so I think that you know what what
happened<00:02:08.630><c> is</c><00:02:08.780><c> like</c><00:02:08.929><c> I</c><00:02:09.050><c> started</c><00:02:09.350><c> off</c><00:02:09.500><c> being</c><00:02:09.679><c> bad</c>

00:02:09.910 --> 00:02:09.920 align:start position:0%
happened is like I started off being bad
 

00:02:09.920 --> 00:02:12.010 align:start position:0%
happened is like I started off being bad
at<00:02:10.100><c> sports</c><00:02:10.369><c> and</c><00:02:10.760><c> then</c><00:02:11.030><c> I</c><00:02:11.060><c> gravitated</c><00:02:11.720><c> towards</c>

00:02:12.010 --> 00:02:12.020 align:start position:0%
at sports and then I gravitated towards
 

00:02:12.020 --> 00:02:14.350 align:start position:0%
at sports and then I gravitated towards
video<00:02:12.290><c> games</c><00:02:12.530><c> because</c><00:02:12.770><c> like</c><00:02:13.070><c> in</c><00:02:13.760><c> video</c><00:02:13.970><c> games</c>

00:02:14.350 --> 00:02:14.360 align:start position:0%
video games because like in video games
 

00:02:14.360 --> 00:02:15.940 align:start position:0%
video games because like in video games
I<00:02:14.510><c> could</c><00:02:14.660><c> be</c><00:02:14.750><c> just</c><00:02:14.990><c> as</c><00:02:15.140><c> good</c><00:02:15.260><c> as</c><00:02:15.410><c> my</c><00:02:15.530><c> colleagues</c>

00:02:15.940 --> 00:02:15.950 align:start position:0%
I could be just as good as my colleagues
 

00:02:15.950 --> 00:02:17.980 align:start position:0%
I could be just as good as my colleagues
and<00:02:16.160><c> the</c><00:02:16.670><c> reason</c><00:02:16.970><c> that</c><00:02:17.000><c> I</c><00:02:17.090><c> was</c><00:02:17.240><c> I</c><00:02:17.450><c> started</c><00:02:17.750><c> to</c>

00:02:17.980 --> 00:02:17.990 align:start position:0%
and the reason that I was I started to
 

00:02:17.990 --> 00:02:19.390 align:start position:0%
and the reason that I was I started to
believe<00:02:18.110><c> I</c><00:02:18.380><c> was</c><00:02:18.470><c> bad</c><00:02:18.680><c> at</c><00:02:18.830><c> sports</c><00:02:19.070><c> and</c><00:02:19.310><c> I</c><00:02:19.370><c> was</c>

00:02:19.390 --> 00:02:19.400 align:start position:0%
believe I was bad at sports and I was
 

00:02:19.400 --> 00:02:21.040 align:start position:0%

00:02:23.140 --> 00:02:23.150 align:start position:0%
just a year younger so there's no way
 

00:02:23.150 --> 00:02:24.430 align:start position:0%

00:05:14.040 --> 00:05:14.050 align:start position:0%
like how does that work so I started off
 

00:05:14.050 --> 00:05:17.220 align:start position:0%
like how does that work so I started off
