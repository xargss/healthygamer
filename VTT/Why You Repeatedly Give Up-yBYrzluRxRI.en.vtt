so<00:01:17.920><c> i</c><00:01:18.080><c> think</c><00:01:18.240><c> the</c><00:01:18.479><c> way</c><00:01:18.640><c> to</c><00:01:18.880><c> approach</c>

00:01:20.070 --> 00:01:20.080 align:start position:0%
so i think the way to approach
 

00:01:20.080 --> 00:01:21.670 align:start position:0%
so i think the way to approach
situations<00:01:20.880><c> like</c><00:01:21.040><c> this</c><00:01:21.360><c> like</c>

00:01:21.670 --> 00:01:21.680 align:start position:0%
situations like this like
 

00:01:21.680 --> 00:01:25.109 align:start position:0%
situations like this like
is<00:01:21.920><c> to</c><00:01:22.159><c> first</c><00:01:22.560><c> understand</c><00:01:24.080><c> what</c><00:01:24.400><c> is</c><00:01:24.560><c> going</c><00:01:24.880><c> on</c>

00:01:25.109 --> 00:01:25.119 align:start position:0%
is to first understand what is going on
 

00:01:25.119 --> 00:01:26.469 align:start position:0%
is to first understand what is going on
inside<00:01:25.600><c> you</c>

00:01:26.469 --> 00:01:26.479 align:start position:0%
inside you
 

00:01:26.479 --> 00:01:28.630 align:start position:0%
inside you
so<00:01:26.640><c> when</c><00:01:26.799><c> a</c><00:01:26.960><c> relationship</c><00:01:27.680><c> comes</c><00:01:28.080><c> is</c><00:01:28.320><c> starting</c>

00:01:28.630 --> 00:01:28.640 align:start position:0%
so when a relationship comes is starting
 

00:01:28.640 --> 00:01:29.670 align:start position:0%
so when a relationship comes is starting

to come to an
 

00:01:29.680 --> 00:01:33.350 align:start position:0%
to come to an
end<00:01:31.360><c> let's</c><00:01:31.680><c> actually</c><00:01:32.000><c> start</c><00:01:32.240><c> a</c><00:01:32.320><c> little</c><00:01:32.560><c> bit</c>

00:01:33.350 --> 00:01:33.360 align:start position:0%
end let's actually start a little bit

you were like
 

00:03:27.200 --> 00:03:29.430 align:start position:0%
you were like
when<00:03:27.440><c> relationships</c><00:03:28.159><c> are</c><00:03:28.319><c> unhealthy</c><00:03:28.879><c> for</c><00:03:29.040><c> me</c>

when relationships are unhealthy for me
 

00:03:29.440 --> 00:03:31.110 align:start position:0%
when relationships are unhealthy for me

i don't
 

00:03:31.120 --> 00:03:32.390 align:start position:0%
i don't
it<00:03:31.200><c> was</c><00:03:31.360><c> almost</c><00:03:31.680><c> like</c><00:03:31.760><c> you</c><00:03:31.920><c> were</c><00:03:32.000><c> saying</c><00:03:32.239><c> i</c>

it was almost like you were saying i
 

00:03:32.400 --> 00:03:34.229 align:start position:0%
it was almost like you were saying i
don't<00:03:32.560><c> have</c><00:03:32.720><c> the</c><00:03:32.959><c> courage</c>

00:03:34.229 --> 00:03:34.239 align:start position:0%
don't have the courage
 

00:03:34.239 --> 00:03:36.630 align:start position:0%
don't have the courage
to<00:03:34.480><c> break</c><00:03:34.799><c> up</c><00:03:34.959><c> with</c><00:03:35.120><c> them</c><00:03:36.159><c> does</c><00:03:36.400><c> that</c><00:03:36.480><c> make</c>

00:03:36.630 --> 00:03:36.640 align:start position:0%
to break up with them does that make
 

00:03:36.640 --> 00:03:37.910 align:start position:0%
to break up with them does that make
sense

00:03:37.910 --> 00:03:37.920 align:start position:0%
sense
 

00:03:37.920 --> 00:03:39.509 align:start position:0%
sense
yeah<00:03:38.080><c> that</c><00:03:38.239><c> kind</c><00:03:38.400><c> of</c><00:03:38.480><c> makes</c><00:03:38.640><c> sense</c><00:03:38.879><c> yeah</c><00:03:39.200><c> but</c><00:03:39.360><c> i</c>

00:03:39.509 --> 00:03:39.519 align:start position:0%
yeah that kind of makes sense yeah but i
 

00:03:39.519 --> 00:03:41.030 align:start position:0%
yeah that kind of makes sense yeah but i
i<00:03:39.680><c> think</c><00:03:39.840><c> that</c><00:03:40.000><c> that's</c><00:03:40.239><c> sort</c><00:03:40.400><c> of</c><00:03:40.560><c> uh</c><00:03:40.799><c> that</c>

00:03:41.030 --> 00:03:41.040 align:start position:0%
i think that that's sort of uh that
 

00:03:41.040 --> 00:03:43.030 align:start position:0%
i think that that's sort of uh that
could<00:03:41.200><c> be</c><00:03:41.360><c> a</c><00:03:41.440><c> little</c><00:03:41.680><c> bit</c><00:03:41.840><c> misleading</c><00:03:42.560><c> because</c>

00:03:43.030 --> 00:03:43.040 align:start position:0%
could be a little bit misleading because
 

00:03:43.040 --> 00:03:46.070 align:start position:0%
could be a little bit misleading because
if<00:03:43.360><c> in</c><00:03:43.519><c> the</c><00:03:43.760><c> moment</c><00:03:45.200><c> you</c><00:03:45.519><c> actually</c>

00:03:46.070 --> 00:03:46.080 align:start position:0%
if in the moment you actually
 

00:03:46.080 --> 00:03:49.110 align:start position:0%
if in the moment you actually
believe<00:03:46.799><c> what</c><00:03:47.040><c> they</c><00:03:47.360><c> say</c><00:03:48.480><c> then</c><00:03:48.720><c> it's</c><00:03:48.879><c> not</c>

00:03:49.110 --> 00:03:49.120 align:start position:0%
believe what they say then it's not
 

00:03:49.120 --> 00:03:50.630 align:start position:0%
believe what they say then it's not
about<00:03:49.440><c> courage</c><00:03:49.920><c> because</c>

00:03:50.630 --> 00:03:50.640 align:start position:0%
about courage because
 

00:03:50.640 --> 00:03:52.390 align:start position:0%
about courage because
you<00:03:50.879><c> actually</c><00:03:51.280><c> genuinely</c><00:03:51.840><c> think</c><00:03:52.000><c> that</c><00:03:52.159><c> you're</c>

00:03:52.390 --> 00:03:52.400 align:start position:0%
you actually genuinely think that you're
 

00:03:52.400 --> 00:03:54.550 align:start position:0%
you actually genuinely think that you're
at<00:03:52.560><c> fault</c>

00:03:54.550 --> 00:03:54.560 align:start position:0%
at fault
 

00:03:54.560 --> 00:03:56.550 align:start position:0%
at fault
yeah<00:03:55.040><c> right</c><00:03:55.280><c> there</c><00:03:55.439><c> are</c><00:03:55.519><c> two</c><00:03:55.680><c> issues</c><00:03:56.000><c> here</c><00:03:56.239><c> one</c>

00:03:56.550 --> 00:03:56.560 align:start position:0%
yeah right there are two issues here one
 

00:03:56.560 --> 00:03:58.949 align:start position:0%
yeah right there are two issues here one
is<00:03:56.640><c> that</c><00:03:57.120><c> you</c><00:03:57.280><c> may</c><00:03:57.519><c> believe</c><00:03:58.080><c> that</c><00:03:58.400><c> you're</c><00:03:58.720><c> at</c>

00:03:58.949 --> 00:03:58.959 align:start position:0%
is that you may believe that you're at
 

00:03:58.959 --> 00:03:59.750 align:start position:0%
is that you may believe that you're at
fault

00:03:59.750 --> 00:03:59.760 align:start position:0%
fault
 

00:03:59.760 --> 00:04:02.470 align:start position:0%
fault
and<00:04:00.080><c> so</c><00:04:00.319><c> like</c><00:04:00.560><c> if</c><00:04:00.720><c> you're</c><00:04:00.959><c> the</c><00:04:01.200><c> problem</c><00:04:01.680><c> like</c>

00:04:02.470 --> 00:04:02.480 align:start position:0%
and so like if you're the problem like
 

00:04:02.480 --> 00:04:03.509 align:start position:0%
and so like if you're the problem like
how<00:04:02.640><c> does</c><00:04:02.879><c> breaking</c><00:04:03.280><c> up</c>

00:04:03.509 --> 00:04:03.519 align:start position:0%
how does breaking up
 

00:04:03.519 --> 00:04:05.910 align:start position:0%
how does breaking up
help<00:04:03.840><c> anything</c><00:04:04.720><c> you</c><00:04:04.879><c> need</c><00:04:05.040><c> to</c><00:04:05.200><c> fix</c><00:04:05.519><c> yourself</c>

00:04:05.910 --> 00:04:05.920 align:start position:0%
help anything you need to fix yourself
 

00:04:05.920 --> 00:04:07.270 align:start position:0%
help anything you need to fix yourself
and<00:04:06.000><c> then</c><00:04:06.159><c> the</c><00:04:06.319><c> relationship</c><00:04:06.879><c> will</c><00:04:07.120><c> be</c>

00:04:07.270 --> 00:04:07.280 align:start position:0%
and then the relationship will be
 

00:04:07.280 --> 00:04:08.309 align:start position:0%
and then the relationship will be
healthy

00:04:08.309 --> 00:04:08.319 align:start position:0%
healthy
 

00:04:08.319 --> 00:04:11.190 align:start position:0%
healthy
does<00:04:08.480><c> that</c><00:04:08.640><c> make</c><00:04:08.799><c> sense</c><00:04:10.000><c> uh</c><00:04:10.239><c> yeah</c><00:04:10.400><c> it</c><00:04:10.480><c> makes</c>

00:04:11.190 --> 00:04:11.200 align:start position:0%
does that make sense uh yeah it makes
 

00:04:11.200 --> 00:04:12.070 align:start position:0%
does that make sense uh yeah it makes
sense

00:04:12.070 --> 00:04:12.080 align:start position:0%
sense
 

00:04:12.080 --> 00:04:13.910 align:start position:0%
sense
and<00:04:12.239><c> then</c><00:04:12.400><c> the</c><00:04:12.640><c> other</c><00:04:12.879><c> option</c><00:04:13.280><c> is</c><00:04:13.360><c> that</c><00:04:13.680><c> you're</c>

00:04:13.910 --> 00:04:13.920 align:start position:0%
and then the other option is that you're
 

00:04:13.920 --> 00:04:15.670 align:start position:0%
and then the other option is that you're
not<00:04:14.239><c> at</c><00:04:14.400><c> fault</c><00:04:14.799><c> but</c><00:04:15.040><c> you</c><00:04:15.280><c> have</c>

there's it's kind of interesting because
it's<00:07:36.880><c> sort</c><00:07:37.039><c> of</c><00:07:37.120><c> like</c><00:07:37.280><c> you</c><00:07:37.440><c> don't</c><00:07:37.680><c> have</c><00:07:38.000><c> the</c>

00:07:43.670 --> 00:07:43.680 align:start position:0%
something really really
 

00:07:43.680 --> 00:07:45.749 align:start position:0%

00:07:45.749 --> 00:07:45.759 align:start position:0%
dangerous which is a lethal combination
 

00:07:45.759 --> 00:07:48.230 align:start position:0%
dangerous which is a lethal combination
with<00:07:45.919><c> that</c><00:07:46.080><c> one</c><00:07:46.319><c> it's</c><00:07:46.479><c> like</c><00:07:46.639><c> a</c><00:07:46.800><c> combo</c>

00:07:48.230 --> 00:07:48.240 align:start position:0%
with that one it's like a combo
 

00:07:48.240 --> 00:07:50.150 align:start position:0%
with that one it's like a combo
which<00:07:48.479><c> is</c><00:07:48.560><c> that</c><00:07:48.720><c> you</c><00:07:48.960><c> do</c><00:07:49.199><c> have</c><00:07:49.440><c> the</c><00:07:49.680><c> power</c><00:07:50.000><c> to</c>

00:07:50.150 --> 00:07:50.160 align:start position:0%
which is that you do have the power to
 

00:07:50.160 --> 00:07:51.909 align:start position:0%
which is that you do have the power to
control<00:07:50.560><c> their</c><00:07:50.800><c> lives</c>

00:07:51.909 --> 00:07:51.919 align:start position:0%
control their lives
 

00:07:51.919 --> 00:07:53.749 align:start position:0%
control their lives
because<00:07:52.240><c> if</c><00:07:52.400><c> you</c><00:07:52.639><c> don't</c><00:07:52.879><c> break</c><00:07:53.120><c> up</c><00:07:53.280><c> with</c><00:07:53.440><c> them</c>

00:07:53.749 --> 00:07:53.759 align:start position:0%
because if you don't break up with them
 

00:07:53.759 --> 00:07:55.350 align:start position:0%
because if you don't break up with them
at<00:07:53.919><c> least</c><00:07:54.319><c> they'll</c><00:07:54.560><c> be</c><00:07:54.800><c> happy</c>

00:07:55.350 --> 00:07:55.360 align:start position:0%
at least they'll be happy
 

00:07:55.360 --> 00:07:56.869 align:start position:0%
at least they'll be happy
or<00:07:55.520><c> if</c><00:07:55.680><c> you</c><00:07:55.759><c> do</c><00:07:55.919><c> break</c><00:07:56.160><c> up</c><00:07:56.319><c> with</c><00:07:56.400><c> them</c><00:07:56.639><c> they'll</c>

00:07:56.869 --> 00:07:56.879 align:start position:0%
or if you do break up with them they'll
 

00:07:56.879 --> 00:07:59.830 align:start position:0%
or if you do break up with them they'll
be<00:07:57.120><c> sad</c><00:07:57.440><c> and</c><00:07:57.599><c> that's</c><00:07:57.840><c> something</c><00:07:58.160><c> you</c><00:07:58.319><c> can</c><00:07:58.560><c> fix</c>

00:07:59.830 --> 00:07:59.840 align:start position:0%
be sad and that's something you can fix
 

00:07:59.840 --> 00:08:01.189 align:start position:0%
be sad and that's something you can fix
so<00:08:00.000><c> i</c><00:08:00.080><c> think</c><00:08:00.240><c> the</c><00:08:00.400><c> reason</c><00:08:00.720><c> that</c><00:08:00.879><c> you</c><00:08:01.039><c> have</c>

00:08:01.189 --> 00:08:01.199 align:start position:0%
so i think the reason that you have
 

00:08:01.199 --> 00:08:02.950 align:start position:0%
so i think the reason that you have
trouble<00:08:01.520><c> in</c><00:08:01.599><c> these</c><00:08:01.759><c> sorts</c><00:08:02.000><c> of</c><00:08:02.160><c> situations</c><00:08:02.800><c> is</c>

00:08:02.950 --> 00:08:02.960 align:start position:0%
trouble in these sorts of situations is
 

00:08:02.960 --> 00:08:04.950 align:start position:0%
trouble in these sorts of situations is
because<00:08:03.199><c> there's</c><00:08:03.440><c> like</c><00:08:03.599><c> a</c><00:08:03.680><c> one-two</c><00:08:04.160><c> punch</c><00:08:04.560><c> of</c>

00:08:04.950 --> 00:08:04.960 align:start position:0%
because there's like a one-two punch of
 

00:08:04.960 --> 00:08:08.230 align:start position:0%
because there's like a one-two punch of
i<00:08:05.120><c> can't</c><00:08:05.440><c> fix</c><00:08:05.680><c> my</c><00:08:06.000><c> i</c><00:08:06.160><c> can't</c><00:08:06.400><c> make</c><00:08:06.639><c> myself</c><00:08:07.120><c> happy</c>

00:08:08.230 --> 00:08:08.240 align:start position:0%
i can't fix my i can't make myself happy
 

00:08:08.240 --> 00:08:10.869 align:start position:0%
i can't fix my i can't make myself happy
but<00:08:08.479><c> i</c><00:08:08.639><c> can</c><00:08:08.879><c> make</c><00:08:09.120><c> them</c><00:08:09.360><c> happy</c><00:08:10.319><c> and</c><00:08:10.479><c> so</c><00:08:10.639><c> if</c><00:08:10.720><c> you</c>

00:08:10.869 --> 00:08:10.879 align:start position:0%
but i can make them happy and so if you
 

00:08:10.879 --> 00:08:12.230 align:start position:0%
but i can make them happy and so if you
really<00:08:11.120><c> think</c><00:08:11.360><c> about</c><00:08:11.599><c> it</c><00:08:11.759><c> it's</c><00:08:11.919><c> like</c><00:08:12.160><c> a</c>

00:08:12.230 --> 00:08:12.240 align:start position:0%
really think about it it's like a
 

00:08:12.240 --> 00:08:14.309 align:start position:0%
really think about it it's like a
logical<00:08:12.800><c> no-brainer</c><00:08:13.440><c> that</c><00:08:13.599><c> like</c><00:08:13.840><c> why</c><00:08:14.080><c> would</c>

00:08:14.309 --> 00:08:14.319 align:start position:0%
logical no-brainer that like why would
 

00:08:14.319 --> 00:08:14.710 align:start position:0%
logical no-brainer that like why would
you

00:08:14.710 --> 00:08:14.720 align:start position:0%
you
 

00:08:14.720 --> 00:08:15.990 align:start position:0%
you
because<00:08:14.879><c> you're</c><00:08:15.120><c> if</c><00:08:15.280><c> you</c><00:08:15.360><c> break</c><00:08:15.599><c> up</c><00:08:15.759><c> with</c><00:08:15.840><c> them</c>

00:08:15.990 --> 00:08:16.000 align:start position:0%
because you're if you break up with them
 

00:08:16.000 --> 00:08:16.950 align:start position:0%
because you're if you break up with them
it's<00:08:16.160><c> not</c><00:08:16.240><c> like</c><00:08:16.400><c> you're</c><00:08:16.560><c> going</c><00:08:16.639><c> to</c><00:08:16.720><c> be</c><00:08:16.800><c> able</c><00:08:16.879><c> to</c>

00:08:16.950 --> 00:08:16.960 align:start position:0%
it's not like you're going to be able to
 

00:08:16.960 --> 00:08:18.950 align:start position:0%
it's not like you're going to be able to
fix<00:08:17.199><c> the</c><00:08:17.280><c> problem</c><00:08:17.599><c> anyway</c>

00:08:18.950 --> 00:08:18.960 align:start position:0%
fix the problem anyway
 

00:08:18.960 --> 00:08:20.869 align:start position:0%
fix the problem anyway
so<00:08:19.199><c> why</c><00:08:19.360><c> would</c><00:08:19.599><c> you</c><00:08:19.840><c> hurt</c><00:08:20.080><c> them</c><00:08:20.560><c> if</c><00:08:20.720><c> you're</c>

00:08:20.869 --> 00:08:20.879 align:start position:0%
so why would you hurt them if you're
 

00:08:20.879 --> 00:08:22.390 align:start position:0%
so why would you hurt them if you're
just<00:08:21.120><c> going</c><00:08:21.199><c> to</c><00:08:21.280><c> be</c><00:08:21.440><c> screwed</c><00:08:21.759><c> on</c><00:08:21.919><c> your</c><00:08:22.080><c> own</c><00:08:22.319><c> and</c>

00:08:22.390 --> 00:08:22.400 align:start position:0%
just going to be screwed on your own and
 

00:08:22.400 --> 00:08:23.830 align:start position:0%
just going to be screwed on your own and
you're<00:08:22.560><c> going</c><00:08:22.639><c> to</c><00:08:22.720><c> screw</c><00:08:22.960><c> them</c><00:08:23.199><c> over</c><00:08:23.440><c> too</c>

00:08:23.830 --> 00:08:23.840 align:start position:0%
you're going to screw them over too
 

00:08:23.840 --> 00:08:25.589 align:start position:0%
you're going to screw them over too
why<00:08:24.080><c> not</c><00:08:24.240><c> just</c><00:08:24.479><c> stay</c><00:08:24.720><c> in</c><00:08:24.800><c> the</c><00:08:24.879><c> relationship</c>

00:08:25.589 --> 00:08:25.599 align:start position:0%
why not just stay in the relationship
 

00:08:25.599 --> 00:08:27.110 align:start position:0%
why not just stay in the relationship
and<00:08:25.680><c> at</c><00:08:25.759><c> least</c><00:08:26.080><c> make</c><00:08:26.319><c> them</c><00:08:26.560><c> happy</c><00:08:26.879><c> because</c>

00:08:27.110 --> 00:08:27.120 align:start position:0%
and at least make them happy because
 

00:08:27.120 --> 00:08:30.469 align:start position:0%
and at least make them happy because
it's<00:08:27.280><c> not</c><00:08:27.440><c> like</c><00:08:27.680><c> you're</c><00:08:27.919><c> salvageable</c>

it's not like you're salvageable
 

00:08:30.479 --> 00:08:32.870 align:start position:0%
it's not like you're salvageable
does<00:08:30.639><c> that</c><00:08:30.960><c> resonate</c><00:08:31.440><c> at</c><00:08:31.599><c> all</c><00:08:31.840><c> or</c><00:08:32.159><c> not</c><00:08:32.320><c> so</c><00:08:32.479><c> much</c>

00:08:32.870 --> 00:08:32.880 align:start position:0%
does that resonate at all or not so much
 

00:08:32.880 --> 00:08:33.589 align:start position:0%
does that resonate at all or not so much

immune system that fights viruses and so
in<00:14:11.760><c> that</c><00:14:11.920><c> way</c><00:14:12.160><c> like</c><00:14:12.320><c> you</c><00:14:12.480><c> have</c><00:14:12.639><c> this</c><00:14:12.880><c> pattern</c>

00:14:13.350 --> 00:14:13.360 align:start position:0%
in that way like you have this pattern
 

00:14:13.360 --> 00:14:14.310 align:start position:0%
in that way like you have this pattern
in<00:14:13.440><c> your</c><00:14:13.600><c> mind</c>

helps you
 

00:14:17.760 --> 00:14:19.829 align:start position:0%
helps you
get<00:14:18.000><c> out</c><00:14:18.160><c> of</c><00:14:18.320><c> like</c><00:14:18.560><c> negative</c><00:14:19.199><c> emotional</c><00:14:19.760><c> and</c>

where i think it's really important to
 

00:14:27.279 --> 00:14:28.629 align:start position:0%
where i think it's really important to
recognize<00:14:27.920><c> that</c>

00:14:28.629 --> 00:14:28.639 align:start position:0%
recognize that
 

00:14:28.639 --> 00:14:31.189 align:start position:0%
recognize that
you're<00:14:28.880><c> not</c><00:14:29.279><c> actually</c><00:14:29.839><c> failing</c><00:14:30.480><c> it's</c><00:14:30.800><c> just</c>

00:14:31.189 --> 00:14:31.199 align:start position:0%
you're not actually failing it's just
 

00:14:31.199 --> 00:14:33.350 align:start position:0%
you're not actually failing it's just
any<00:14:31.519><c> time</c><00:14:31.839><c> something</c><00:14:32.320><c> anytime</c><00:14:32.720><c> you</c><00:14:32.959><c> start</c><00:14:33.199><c> to</c>

00:14:33.350 --> 00:14:33.360 align:start position:0%
any time something anytime you start to
 

00:14:33.360 --> 00:14:34.470 align:start position:0%
any time something anytime you start to
succeed<00:14:33.839><c> and</c><00:14:33.920><c> you're</c>

00:14:34.470 --> 00:14:34.480 align:start position:0%
succeed and you're
 

00:14:34.480 --> 00:14:36.310 align:start position:0%
succeed and you're
actually<00:14:34.959><c> succeeding</c><00:14:35.519><c> this</c><00:14:35.760><c> pattern</c><00:14:36.160><c> is</c>

00:14:36.310 --> 00:14:36.320 align:start position:0%
actually succeeding this pattern is
 

00:14:36.320 --> 00:14:37.590 align:start position:0%
actually succeeding this pattern is
going<00:14:36.399><c> to</c><00:14:36.560><c> wake</c><00:14:36.800><c> up</c><00:14:37.279><c> and</c>

00:14:37.590 --> 00:14:37.600 align:start position:0%
going to wake up and
 

00:14:37.600 --> 00:14:40.710 align:start position:0%
going to wake up and
tell<00:14:37.839><c> you</c><00:14:38.079><c> that</c><00:14:38.240><c> you're</c><00:14:38.480><c> failing</c>

00:14:40.710 --> 00:14:40.720 align:start position:0%
tell you that you're failing
 

00:14:40.720 --> 00:14:43.189 align:start position:0%
tell you that you're failing
and<00:14:40.959><c> be</c><00:14:41.199><c> aware</c><00:14:41.600><c> of</c><00:14:41.680><c> that</c><00:14:42.079><c> and</c><00:14:42.320><c> recognize</c><00:14:42.959><c> that</c>

00:14:43.189 --> 00:14:43.199 align:start position:0%
and be aware of that and recognize that
 

00:14:43.199 --> 00:14:45.670 align:start position:0%
and be aware of that and recognize that
like<00:14:43.680><c> the</c><00:14:43.920><c> stronger</c><00:14:44.480><c> that</c><00:14:44.720><c> pattern</c><00:14:45.199><c> is</c>

00:14:45.670 --> 00:14:45.680 align:start position:0%
like the stronger that pattern is
 

00:14:45.680 --> 00:14:49.110 align:start position:0%
like the stronger that pattern is
oddly<00:14:46.240><c> enough</c><00:14:47.199><c> the</c><00:14:47.360><c> better</c><00:14:47.680><c> you're</c><00:14:47.920><c> doing</c>

00:14:49.110 --> 00:14:49.120 align:start position:0%
oddly enough the better you're doing
 

00:14:49.120 --> 00:14:51.189 align:start position:0%
oddly enough the better you're doing
because<00:14:49.440><c> it</c><00:14:49.680><c> doesn't</c><00:14:50.079><c> turn</c><00:14:50.320><c> on</c><00:14:50.639><c> unless</c><00:14:50.959><c> you're</c>

00:14:51.189 --> 00:14:51.199 align:start position:0%
because it doesn't turn on unless you're
 

00:14:51.199 --> 00:14:56.069 align:start position:0%
because it doesn't turn on unless you're
doing<00:14:51.440><c> well</c>

00:14:56.069 --> 00:14:56.079 align:start position:0%
 
 

00:14:56.079 --> 00:14:59.189 align:start position:0%
 
what<00:14:56.240><c> do</c><00:14:56.320><c> you</c><00:14:56.399><c> think</c><00:14:56.639><c> about</c><00:14:56.880><c> that</c><00:14:58.399><c> um</c>

00:14:59.189 --> 00:14:59.199 align:start position:0%
what do you think about that um

what do you think about that um
yeah<00:14:59.360><c> i</c><00:14:59.440><c> mean</c><00:14:59.519><c> that</c><00:14:59.760><c> makes</c><00:15:00.000><c> sense</c><00:15:00.399><c> like</c><00:15:00.639><c> it's</c>

00:15:00.870 --> 00:15:00.880 align:start position:0%
yeah i mean that makes sense like it's
