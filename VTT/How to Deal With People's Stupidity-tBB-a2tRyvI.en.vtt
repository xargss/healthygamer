00:04:43.199 --> 00:04:44.790 align:start position:0%
god
so<00:04:43.360><c> we</c><00:04:43.520><c> take</c><00:04:43.759><c> that</c><00:04:44.000><c> angle</c><00:04:44.240><c> which</c><00:04:44.479><c> it</c><00:04:44.560><c> sounds</c>

00:04:44.790 --> 00:04:44.800 align:start position:0%
so we take that angle which it sounds
 

00:04:44.800 --> 00:04:45.990 align:start position:0%
so we take that angle which it sounds
like<00:04:44.880><c> you're</c><00:04:45.040><c> pretty</c><00:04:45.280><c> familiar</c><00:04:45.600><c> with</c><00:04:45.759><c> so</c><00:04:45.919><c> i</c>

00:04:45.990 --> 00:04:46.000 align:start position:0%
like you're pretty familiar with so i
 

00:04:46.000 --> 00:04:47.510 align:start position:0%
like you're pretty familiar with so i
would<00:04:46.160><c> encourage</c><00:04:46.479><c> you</c><00:04:46.639><c> to</c><00:04:46.720><c> explore</c><00:04:47.040><c> that</c>

00:04:47.510 --> 00:04:47.520 align:start position:0%
would encourage you to explore that
 

00:04:47.520 --> 00:04:48.790 align:start position:0%
would encourage you to explore that
the<00:04:47.680><c> second</c><00:04:48.000><c> thing</c><00:04:48.160><c> that</c><00:04:48.240><c> you</c><00:04:48.400><c> could</c><00:04:48.479><c> do</c><00:04:48.639><c> is</c>

00:04:48.790 --> 00:04:48.800 align:start position:0%
the second thing that you could do is
 

00:04:48.800 --> 00:04:51.030 align:start position:0%
the second thing that you could do is
balance<00:04:49.120><c> your</c><00:04:49.280><c> ayurvedic</c><00:04:49.840><c> dosha</c>

00:04:51.030 --> 00:04:51.040 align:start position:0%
balance your ayurvedic dosha
 

00:04:51.040 --> 00:04:53.030 align:start position:0%
balance your ayurvedic dosha
so<00:04:51.199><c> if</c><00:04:51.280><c> we</c><00:04:51.440><c> think</c><00:04:51.600><c> about</c><00:04:51.919><c> res</c><00:04:52.400><c> like</c><00:04:52.560><c> you're</c>

00:04:53.030 --> 00:04:53.040 align:start position:0%
so if we think about res like you're
 

00:04:53.040 --> 00:04:54.070 align:start position:0%
so if we think about res like you're
you're<00:04:53.280><c> asking</c><00:04:53.680><c> me</c>

00:04:54.070 --> 00:04:54.080 align:start position:0%
you're asking me
 

00:04:54.080 --> 00:04:57.909 align:start position:0%
you're asking me
not<00:04:54.400><c> how</c><00:04:54.639><c> to</c><00:04:54.960><c> deal</c><00:04:55.919><c> with</c><00:04:56.160><c> the</c><00:04:56.320><c> impulsive</c><00:04:56.800><c> anger</c>

00:04:57.909 --> 00:04:57.919 align:start position:0%
not how to deal with the impulsive anger
 

00:04:57.919 --> 00:05:01.749 align:start position:0%
not how to deal with the impulsive anger
but<00:04:58.639><c> how</c><00:04:58.960><c> to</c><00:04:59.680><c> prevent</c><00:05:00.160><c> the</c><00:05:00.320><c> impulsive</c><00:05:00.800><c> anger</c>

00:05:01.749 --> 00:05:01.759 align:start position:0%
but how to prevent the impulsive anger
 

00:05:01.759 --> 00:05:03.350 align:start position:0%
but how to prevent the impulsive anger
right<00:05:02.000><c> how</c><00:05:02.160><c> to</c><00:05:02.240><c> stop</c><00:05:02.479><c> the</c><00:05:02.639><c> short</c><00:05:02.880><c> fuse</c><00:05:03.199><c> in</c><00:05:03.280><c> the</c>

00:05:03.350 --> 00:05:03.360 align:start position:0%
right how to stop the short fuse in the
 

00:05:03.360 --> 00:05:05.270 align:start position:0%
right how to stop the short fuse in the
first<00:05:03.600><c> place</c>

00:05:05.270 --> 00:05:05.280 align:start position:0%
first place
 

00:05:05.280 --> 00:05:06.950 align:start position:0%
first place
and<00:05:05.360><c> so</c><00:05:05.520><c> that's</c><00:05:05.759><c> where</c><00:05:06.000><c> i</c><00:05:06.320><c> encourage</c><00:05:06.720><c> you</c><00:05:06.880><c> to</c>

00:05:06.950 --> 00:05:06.960 align:start position:0%
and so that's where i encourage you to
 

00:05:06.960 --> 00:05:09.670 align:start position:0%
and so that's where i encourage you to
think<00:05:07.199><c> a</c><00:05:07.280><c> little</c><00:05:07.520><c> bit</c><00:05:07.680><c> about</c><00:05:08.160><c> expectation</c>

00:05:09.670 --> 00:05:09.680 align:start position:0%
think a little bit about expectation
 

00:05:09.680 --> 00:05:11.590 align:start position:0%
think a little bit about expectation
and<00:05:09.919><c> what</c><00:05:10.160><c> you</c><00:05:10.320><c> expect</c><00:05:10.720><c> from</c><00:05:10.960><c> other</c><00:05:11.199><c> people</c>

00:05:11.590 --> 00:05:11.600 align:start position:0%
and what you expect from other people
 

00:05:11.600 --> 00:05:13.749 align:start position:0%
and what you expect from other people
because<00:05:11.840><c> i</c><00:05:12.000><c> would</c><00:05:12.160><c> suspect</c><00:05:12.720><c> that</c>

00:05:13.749 --> 00:05:13.759 align:start position:0%
because i would suspect that
 

00:05:13.759 --> 00:05:16.070 align:start position:0%
because i would suspect that
it<00:05:14.000><c> is</c><00:05:14.320><c> other</c><00:05:14.560><c> people's</c><00:05:15.120><c> inability</c><00:05:15.680><c> to</c><00:05:15.840><c> live</c>

00:05:16.070 --> 00:05:16.080 align:start position:0%
it is other people's inability to live
 

00:05:16.080 --> 00:05:17.749 align:start position:0%
it is other people's inability to live
up<00:05:16.160><c> to</c><00:05:16.240><c> your</c><00:05:16.479><c> expectations</c><00:05:17.280><c> that</c><00:05:17.520><c> is</c><00:05:17.600><c> the</c>

00:05:17.749 --> 00:05:17.759 align:start position:0%
up to your expectations that is the
 

00:05:17.759 --> 00:05:18.150 align:start position:0%
up to your expectations that is the
short

00:05:18.150 --> 00:05:18.160 align:start position:0%
short
 

00:05:18.160 --> 00:05:21.189 align:start position:0%
short
that<00:05:18.479><c> leads</c><00:05:18.720><c> to</c><00:05:18.880><c> the</c><00:05:18.960><c> shortness</c><00:05:19.440><c> of</c><00:05:19.520><c> views</c>

00:05:21.189 --> 00:05:21.199 align:start position:0%
that leads to the shortness of views
 

00:05:21.199 --> 00:05:23.189 align:start position:0%
that leads to the shortness of views
so<00:05:21.520><c> you're</c><00:05:21.759><c> just</c><00:05:22.160><c> asking</c><00:05:22.639><c> a</c><00:05:22.720><c> lot</c><00:05:22.880><c> of</c><00:05:22.960><c> them</c>

00:05:23.189 --> 00:05:23.199 align:start position:0%
so you're just asking a lot of them

so in western medicine we think like
 

00:06:08.240 --> 00:06:09.830 align:start position:0%
so in western medicine we think like

anybody know if you guys know
french<00:13:43.839><c> you</c><00:13:44.000><c> know</c><00:13:45.199><c> yeah</c><00:13:45.440><c> it's</c><00:13:45.600><c> an</c><00:13:45.760><c> enzyme</c>

00:13:46.949 --> 00:13:46.959 align:start position:0%
french you know yeah it's an enzyme
 

00:13:46.959 --> 00:13:49.829 align:start position:0%
french you know yeah it's an enzyme
so<00:13:47.120><c> it's</c><00:13:47.279><c> an</c><00:13:47.440><c> enzyme</c><00:13:47.760><c> that</c><00:13:48.000><c> breaks</c><00:13:48.240><c> down</c><00:13:48.560><c> fat</c>

00:13:49.829 --> 00:13:49.839 align:start position:0%
so it's an enzyme that breaks down fat
 

00:13:49.839 --> 00:13:51.350 align:start position:0%
so it's an enzyme that breaks down fat
so<00:13:50.000><c> then</c><00:13:50.160><c> there's</c><00:13:50.399><c> also</c><00:13:50.639><c> something</c><00:13:50.880><c> called</c><00:13:51.120><c> an</c>

00:13:51.350 --> 00:13:51.360 align:start position:0%
so then there's also something called an
 

00:13:51.360 --> 00:13:53.910 align:start position:0%
so then there's also something called an
amylase<00:13:52.560><c> which</c><00:13:52.720><c> is</c><00:13:52.880><c> an</c><00:13:53.040><c> enzyme</c><00:13:53.440><c> that</c><00:13:53.680><c> breaks</c>

00:13:53.910 --> 00:13:53.920 align:start position:0%
amylase which is an enzyme that breaks

and<00:13:55.680><c> then</c><00:13:55.839><c> there's</c><00:13:56.000><c> something</c><00:13:56.320><c> called</c><00:13:56.560><c> a</c>

00:13:56.629 --> 00:13:56.639 align:start position:0%
and then there's something called a
 

00:13:56.639 --> 00:13:59.030 align:start position:0%
and then there's something called a
protease<00:13:57.839><c> which</c><00:13:58.000><c> is</c><00:13:58.160><c> an</c><00:13:58.320><c> enzyme</c><00:13:58.639><c> that</c><00:13:58.800><c> breaks</c>

00:13:59.030 --> 00:13:59.040 align:start position:0%

00:14:53.910 --> 00:14:53.920 align:start position:0%
because in my stomach there's like
 

00:14:53.920 --> 00:14:55.910 align:start position:0%
because in my stomach there's like

00:14:57.590 --> 00:14:57.600 align:start position:0%
protein and so the digestion works out
 

00:14:57.600 --> 00:14:58.949 align:start position:0%

the<00:14:59.199><c> problem</c><00:14:59.600><c> is</c><00:14:59.680><c> that</c><00:14:59.839><c> if</c><00:15:00.000><c> i</c><00:15:00.079><c> eat</c><00:15:00.320><c> for</c><00:15:00.480><c> example</c>

00:15:01.110 --> 00:15:01.120 align:start position:0%
the problem is that if i eat for example
 

00:15:01.120 --> 00:15:02.949 align:start position:0%
the problem is that if i eat for example

00:15:02.949 --> 00:15:02.959 align:start position:0%
different kinds of things together
 

00:15:02.959 --> 00:15:05.269 align:start position:0%

if<00:15:03.120><c> i</c><00:15:03.360><c> eat</c><00:15:03.920><c> partially</c><00:15:04.480><c> carbohydrate</c>

if i eat partially carbohydrate
 

00:15:05.279 --> 00:15:07.829 align:start position:0%
if i eat partially carbohydrate
partially<00:15:05.760><c> protein</c><00:15:06.240><c> and</c><00:15:06.399><c> partially</c><00:15:06.959><c> fat</c>

00:15:07.829 --> 00:15:07.839 align:start position:0%
partially protein and partially fat
 

00:15:07.839 --> 00:15:09.430 align:start position:0%
partially protein and partially fat
then<00:15:08.000><c> i've</c><00:15:08.160><c> got</c><00:15:08.480><c> three</c><00:15:08.800><c> different</c><00:15:09.040><c> kinds</c><00:15:09.360><c> of</c>

00:15:09.430 --> 00:15:09.440 align:start position:0%
then i've got three different kinds of
 

00:15:09.440 --> 00:15:11.030 align:start position:0%
then i've got three different kinds of

and<00:15:11.920><c> three</c><00:15:12.240><c> different</c><00:15:12.480><c> kinds</c><00:15:12.720><c> of</c><00:15:12.880><c> enzymes</c>

00:15:13.350 --> 00:15:13.360 align:start position:0%

00:15:13.360 --> 00:15:14.870 align:start position:0%

00:15:14.880 --> 00:15:17.110 align:start position:0%

and<00:15:15.040><c> so</c><00:15:15.199><c> the</c><00:15:15.440><c> chance</c><00:15:15.839><c> that</c><00:15:16.160><c> a</c><00:15:16.320><c> carbohydrate</c>

00:15:17.110 --> 00:15:17.120 align:start position:0%
and so the chance that a carbohydrate
 

00:15:17.120 --> 00:15:18.949 align:start position:0%
and so the chance that a carbohydrate
molecule<00:15:17.760><c> hits</c><00:15:18.000><c> an</c><00:15:18.160><c> amylase</c>

00:15:18.949 --> 00:15:18.959 align:start position:0%
molecule hits an amylase
 

00:15:18.959 --> 00:15:21.910 align:start position:0%
molecule hits an amylase
is<00:15:19.120><c> only</c><00:15:19.360><c> 30</c><00:15:20.880><c> so</c><00:15:21.040><c> that</c><00:15:21.199><c> what</c><00:15:21.360><c> that</c><00:15:21.519><c> means</c><00:15:21.760><c> is</c>

00:15:21.910 --> 00:15:21.920 align:start position:0%
is only 30 so that what that means is
 

00:15:21.920 --> 00:15:22.550 align:start position:0%
is only 30 so that what that means is
that<00:15:22.000><c> there's</c><00:15:22.240><c> like</c>

00:15:22.550 --> 00:15:22.560 align:start position:0%
that there's like
 

00:15:22.560 --> 00:15:29.030 align:start position:0%
that there's like

00:15:32.870 --> 00:15:32.880 align:start position:0%
yeah so the the problem with smoothies
 

00:15:32.880 --> 00:15:34.870 align:start position:0%
yeah so the the problem with smoothies
if<00:15:32.959><c> you</c><00:15:33.120><c> talk</c><00:15:33.360><c> to</c><00:15:33.519><c> ayurvedic</c><00:15:34.160><c> or</c><00:15:34.240><c> naturopathic</c>

00:15:49.030 --> 00:15:49.040 align:start position:0%
is a burger healthy well like it depends
 

00:15:49.040 --> 00:15:50.389 align:start position:0%
is a burger healthy well like it depends
on<00:15:49.120><c> what</c><00:15:49.279><c> you're</c><00:15:49.440><c> comparing</c><00:15:50.000><c> it</c><00:15:50.079><c> to</c>
