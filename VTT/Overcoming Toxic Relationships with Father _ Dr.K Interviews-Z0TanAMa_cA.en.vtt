00:02:32.650 --> 00:02:32.660 align:start position:0%
the people who are watching so the first
 

00:02:32.660 --> 00:02:34.140 align:start position:0%
the people who are watching so the first
thing<00:02:32.840><c> is</c><00:02:32.959><c> like</c><00:02:33.110><c> you</c><00:02:33.230><c> fight</c><00:02:33.530><c> against</c><00:02:33.920><c> them</c>

00:02:34.140 --> 00:02:34.150 align:start position:0%
thing is like you fight against them
 

00:02:34.150 --> 00:02:38.320 align:start position:0%
thing is like you fight against them
right<00:02:35.150><c> so</c><00:02:35.330><c> it's</c><00:02:35.480><c> a</c><00:02:35.600><c> battle</c><00:02:35.989><c> yes</c><00:02:36.890><c> and</c><00:02:37.250><c> do</c><00:02:38.239><c> you</c>

00:02:38.320 --> 00:02:38.330 align:start position:0%
right so it's a battle yes and do you
 

00:02:38.330 --> 00:02:40.030 align:start position:0%
right so it's a battle yes and do you
know<00:02:38.540><c> who</c><00:02:38.780><c> wins</c><00:02:39.050><c> when</c><00:02:39.410><c> you</c><00:02:39.500><c> fight</c><00:02:39.709><c> against</c>

00:02:40.030 --> 00:02:40.040 align:start position:0%
know who wins when you fight against
 

00:02:40.040 --> 00:02:43.680 align:start position:0%
know who wins when you fight against
yourself<00:02:40.780><c> probably</c><00:02:41.780><c> no</c><00:02:42.170><c> one</c><00:02:42.380><c> absolutely</c>

00:02:43.680 --> 00:02:43.690 align:start position:0%
yourself probably no one absolutely
 

00:02:43.690 --> 00:02:45.850 align:start position:0%
yourself probably no one absolutely
right<00:02:44.690><c> so</c><00:02:45.140><c> that's</c><00:02:45.200><c> the</c><00:02:45.380><c> first</c><00:02:45.620><c> thing</c><00:02:45.709><c> to</c>

00:02:45.850 --> 00:02:45.860 align:start position:0%
right so that's the first thing to
 

00:02:45.860 --> 00:02:47.740 align:start position:0%
right so that's the first thing to
understand<00:02:46.310><c> is</c><00:02:46.459><c> that</c><00:02:46.970><c> like</c><00:02:47.239><c> when</c><00:02:47.390><c> you</c><00:02:47.510><c> fight</c>

00:02:47.740 --> 00:02:47.750 align:start position:0%
understand is that like when you fight
 

00:02:47.750 --> 00:02:49.240 align:start position:0%
understand is that like when you fight
against<00:02:48.140><c> yourself</c><00:02:48.500><c> you</c><00:02:48.680><c> just</c><00:02:48.709><c> can't</c><00:02:49.070><c> win</c>

00:02:49.240 --> 00:02:49.250 align:start position:0%
against yourself you just can't win
 

00:02:49.250 --> 00:02:50.710 align:start position:0%
against yourself you just can't win
there's<00:02:49.550><c> like</c><00:02:49.760><c> there's</c><00:02:50.030><c> no</c><00:02:50.180><c> winning</c><00:02:50.390><c> because</c>

00:02:50.710 --> 00:02:50.720 align:start position:0%
there's like there's no winning because
 

00:02:50.720 --> 00:02:52.449 align:start position:0%
there's like there's no winning because
like<00:02:51.019><c> you're</c><00:02:51.560><c> gonna</c><00:02:51.680><c> lose</c><00:02:51.920><c> and</c><00:02:52.220><c> you're</c><00:02:52.310><c> gonna</c>

actually don't do that right when when
 

00:06:04.830 --> 00:06:05.900 align:start position:0%
actually don't do that right when when
they<00:06:04.920><c> turn</c><00:06:05.130><c> away</c><00:06:05.250><c> what</c><00:06:05.490><c> you're</c><00:06:05.580><c> actually</c>

00:06:05.900 --> 00:06:05.910 align:start position:0%
they turn away what you're actually
 

00:06:05.910 --> 00:06:07.580 align:start position:0%
they turn away what you're actually
saying<00:06:06.120><c> is</c><00:06:06.270><c> that</c><00:06:06.450><c> when</c><00:06:06.960><c> they</c><00:06:07.110><c> shut</c><00:06:07.410><c> you</c><00:06:07.560><c> down</c>

00:06:07.580 --> 00:06:07.590 align:start position:0%
saying is that when they shut you down
 

00:06:07.590 --> 00:06:09.340 align:start position:0%
saying is that when they shut you down
you<00:06:08.100><c> don't</c><00:06:08.130><c> try</c><00:06:08.550><c> hard</c><00:06:08.880><c> enough</c>

00:06:09.340 --> 00:06:09.350 align:start position:0%
you don't try hard enough
 

00:06:09.350 --> 00:06:11.570 align:start position:0%
you don't try hard enough
yeah<00:06:10.350><c> bizarre</c><00:06:10.770><c> way</c><00:06:10.950><c> it</c><00:06:11.070><c> sounds</c><00:06:11.340><c> to</c><00:06:11.430><c> me</c><00:06:11.550><c> like</c>

00:06:11.570 --> 00:06:11.580 align:start position:0%
yeah bizarre way it sounds to me like
 

00:06:11.580 --> 00:06:13.250 align:start position:0%
yeah bizarre way it sounds to me like
you<00:06:11.820><c> actually</c><00:06:11.970><c> accept</c><00:06:12.540><c> rejection</c><00:06:12.930><c> way</c><00:06:13.200><c> too</c>

00:06:13.250 --> 00:06:13.260 align:start position:0%
you actually accept rejection way too
 

00:06:13.260 --> 00:06:16.580 align:start position:0%
you actually accept rejection way too
easily<00:06:13.560><c> I</c><00:06:14.930><c> never</c><00:06:15.930><c> thought</c><00:06:16.050><c> about</c><00:06:16.110><c> that</c><00:06:16.290><c> but</c>

00:06:16.580 --> 00:06:16.590 align:start position:0%
easily I never thought about that but
 

00:06:16.590 --> 00:06:18.770 align:start position:0%
easily I never thought about that but
yeah<00:06:16.800><c> how</c><00:06:17.550><c> does</c><00:06:17.610><c> that</c><00:06:17.790><c> feel</c><00:06:18.030><c> when</c><00:06:18.360><c> I</c><00:06:18.390><c> say</c><00:06:18.600><c> that</c>

00:06:18.770 --> 00:06:18.780 align:start position:0%
yeah how does that feel when I say that
 

00:06:18.780 --> 00:06:20.690 align:start position:0%
yeah how does that feel when I say that
like<00:06:18.990><c> does</c><00:06:19.200><c> that</c><00:06:19.230><c> resonate</c><00:06:19.770><c> is</c><00:06:20.250><c> that</c><00:06:20.430><c> what</c>

00:06:20.690 --> 00:06:20.700 align:start position:0%
like does that resonate is that what
 

00:06:20.700 --> 00:06:25.340 align:start position:0%
like does that resonate is that what
could<00:06:20.850><c> be</c><00:06:20.970><c> going</c><00:06:21.120><c> on</c><00:06:23.000><c> it's</c><00:06:24.000><c> a</c><00:06:24.260><c> definitely</c><00:06:25.260><c> a</c>

00:06:25.340 --> 00:06:25.350 align:start position:0%
could be going on it's a definitely a
 

00:06:25.350 --> 00:06:28.100 align:start position:0%
could be going on it's a definitely a
new<00:06:25.710><c> idea</c><00:06:26.160><c> and</c><00:06:26.460><c> yes</c><00:06:26.670><c> it</c><00:06:26.820><c> does</c><00:06:26.970><c> resonate</c><00:06:27.180><c> okay</c>

00:06:28.100 --> 00:06:28.110 align:start position:0%
new idea and yes it does resonate okay
 

00:06:28.110 --> 00:06:30.320 align:start position:0%
new idea and yes it does resonate okay
so<00:06:28.980><c> now</c><00:06:29.130><c> like</c><00:06:29.370><c> so</c><00:06:29.520><c> this</c><00:06:29.640><c> is</c><00:06:29.700><c> why</c><00:06:29.940><c> people</c><00:06:30.150><c> don't</c>

00:06:30.320 --> 00:06:30.330 align:start position:0%
so now like so this is why people don't
 

00:06:30.330 --> 00:06:33.350 align:start position:0%
so now like so this is why people don't
move<00:06:30.660><c> forward</c><00:06:31.130><c> because</c><00:06:32.130><c> their</c><00:06:32.550><c> conception</c><00:06:33.240><c> of</c>

00:06:33.350 --> 00:06:33.360 align:start position:0%
move forward because their conception of
 

00:06:33.360 --> 00:06:34.940 align:start position:0%
move forward because their conception of
what's<00:06:33.540><c> wrong</c><00:06:33.750><c> with</c><00:06:33.930><c> them</c><00:06:34.140><c> is</c><00:06:34.170><c> actually</c><00:06:34.500><c> wrong</c>

00:06:34.940 --> 00:06:34.950 align:start position:0%
what's wrong with them is actually wrong
 

00:06:34.950 --> 00:06:37.280 align:start position:0%
what's wrong with them is actually wrong
because<00:06:35.670><c> good</c><00:06:36.030><c> diagnosis</c><00:06:36.660><c> precedes</c><00:06:37.080><c> good</c>

00:06:37.280 --> 00:06:37.290 align:start position:0%
because good diagnosis precedes good
 

00:06:37.290 --> 00:06:39.590 align:start position:0%
because good diagnosis precedes good
treatment<00:06:37.740><c> and</c><00:06:37.950><c> so</c><00:06:38.700><c> here</c><00:06:38.970><c> you</c><00:06:39.120><c> are</c><00:06:39.300><c> saying</c>

00:06:39.590 --> 00:06:39.600 align:start position:0%
treatment and so here you are saying
 

00:06:39.600 --> 00:06:42.170 align:start position:0%
treatment and so here you are saying
that<00:06:39.690><c> you</c><00:06:39.960><c> don't</c><00:06:40.140><c> accept</c><00:06:40.560><c> rejection</c><00:06:41.340><c> easily</c>

00:06:42.170 --> 00:06:42.180 align:start position:0%
that you don't accept rejection easily
 

00:06:42.180 --> 00:06:44.270 align:start position:0%
that you don't accept rejection easily
enough<00:06:42.480><c> but</c><00:06:43.170><c> I</c><00:06:43.200><c> think</c><00:06:43.440><c> like</c><00:06:43.530><c> the</c><00:06:43.680><c> problem</c><00:06:44.070><c> here</c>

00:06:44.270 --> 00:06:44.280 align:start position:0%
enough but I think like the problem here
 

00:06:44.280 --> 00:06:46.070 align:start position:0%
enough but I think like the problem here
is<00:06:44.340><c> that</c><00:06:44.370><c> you</c><00:06:44.580><c> accept</c><00:06:45.120><c> it</c><00:06:45.240><c> too</c><00:06:45.420><c> easily</c><00:06:45.840><c> and</c>

00:06:46.070 --> 00:06:46.080 align:start position:0%
is that you accept it too easily and
 

00:06:46.080 --> 00:06:49.430 align:start position:0%
is that you accept it too easily and
that's<00:06:46.260><c> what</c><00:06:46.650><c> traps</c><00:06:47.040><c> you</c><00:06:47.300><c> you</c><00:06:48.300><c> see</c><00:06:48.420><c> that</c><00:06:48.570><c> yeah</c>

00:06:49.430 --> 00:06:49.440 align:start position:0%
that's what traps you you see that yeah
 

00:06:49.440 --> 00:06:52.160 align:start position:0%
that's what traps you you see that yeah
and<00:06:50.120><c> so</c><00:06:51.120><c> what</c><00:06:51.240><c> we</c><00:06:51.360><c> have</c><00:06:51.540><c> to</c><00:06:51.690><c> teach</c><00:06:51.870><c> you</c><00:06:51.990><c> how</c><00:06:52.020><c> to</c>

00:06:52.160 --> 00:06:52.170 align:start position:0%
and so what we have to teach you how to
 

00:06:52.170 --> 00:06:54.140 align:start position:0%
and so what we have to teach you how to
do<00:06:52.380><c> is</c><00:06:52.530><c> actually</c><00:06:52.740><c> do</c><00:06:53.220><c> the</c><00:06:53.370><c> very</c><00:06:53.550><c> thing</c><00:06:53.820><c> so</c><00:06:54.060><c> if</c>

00:06:54.140 --> 00:06:54.150 align:start position:0%
do is actually do the very thing so if
 

00:06:54.150 --> 00:06:56.030 align:start position:0%
do is actually do the very thing so if
you<00:06:54.270><c> think</c><00:06:54.630><c> that</c><00:06:54.900><c> you're</c><00:06:55.080><c> running</c><00:06:55.530><c> a</c><00:06:55.710><c> certain</c>

00:06:56.030 --> 00:06:56.040 align:start position:0%
you think that you're running a certain
 

00:06:56.040 --> 00:06:57.740 align:start position:0%
you think that you're running a certain
play<00:06:56.280><c> but</c><00:06:56.880><c> you're</c><00:06:56.970><c> actually</c><00:06:57.150><c> running</c><00:06:57.510><c> an</c>

00:06:57.740 --> 00:06:57.750 align:start position:0%
play but you're actually running an
 

00:06:57.750 --> 00:06:58.850 align:start position:0%
play but you're actually running an
opposite<00:06:58.110><c> play</c><00:06:58.230><c> if</c><00:06:58.350><c> you</c><00:06:58.440><c> think</c><00:06:58.710><c> you're</c>

00:06:58.850 --> 00:06:58.860 align:start position:0%
opposite play if you think you're
 

00:06:58.860 --> 00:07:00.020 align:start position:0%
opposite play if you think you're
playing<00:06:58.980><c> a</c><00:06:59.220><c> passing</c><00:06:59.610><c> game</c><00:06:59.730><c> do</c><00:06:59.850><c> you</c><00:06:59.940><c> watch</c>

00:07:00.020 --> 00:07:00.030 align:start position:0%
playing a passing game do you watch
 

00:07:00.030 --> 00:07:04.340 align:start position:0%
playing a passing game do you watch
football<00:07:01.070><c> okay</c><00:07:02.810><c> do</c><00:07:03.810><c> you</c><00:07:03.900><c> understand</c><00:07:04.260><c> off</c>

00:07:04.340 --> 00:07:04.350 align:start position:0%
football okay do you understand off
 

00:07:04.350 --> 00:07:06.470 align:start position:0%
football okay do you understand off
about<00:07:04.590><c> it</c><00:07:04.740><c> to</c><00:07:04.830><c> follow</c><00:07:05.040><c> you</c><00:07:05.280><c> okay</c><00:07:05.520><c> so</c><00:07:06.000><c> like</c><00:07:06.120><c> if</c><00:07:06.330><c> I</c>

00:07:06.470 --> 00:07:06.480 align:start position:0%
about it to follow you okay so like if I
 

00:07:06.480 --> 00:07:08.660 align:start position:0%
about it to follow you okay so like if I
think<00:07:06.840><c> I'm</c><00:07:06.990><c> running</c><00:07:07.170><c> a</c><00:07:07.350><c> passing</c><00:07:07.830><c> game</c><00:07:08.010><c> but</c><00:07:08.340><c> I'm</c>

00:07:08.660 --> 00:07:08.670 align:start position:0%
think I'm running a passing game but I'm
 

00:07:08.670 --> 00:07:10.250 align:start position:0%
think I'm running a passing game but I'm
actually<00:07:08.880><c> running</c><00:07:09.300><c> a</c><00:07:09.510><c> running</c><00:07:09.840><c> game</c><00:07:10.020><c> and</c>

00:07:10.250 --> 00:07:10.260 align:start position:0%
actually running a running game and
 

00:07:10.260 --> 00:07:13.010 align:start position:0%
actually running a running game and
that's<00:07:10.650><c> not</c><00:07:10.890><c> working</c><00:07:11.370><c> like</c><00:07:11.630><c> what</c><00:07:12.630><c> I</c><00:07:12.660><c> need</c><00:07:12.870><c> to</c>

00:07:13.010 --> 00:07:13.020 align:start position:0%
that's not working like what I need to
 

00:07:13.020 --> 00:07:14.750 align:start position:0%
that's not working like what I need to
do<00:07:13.170><c> is</c><00:07:13.320><c> like</c><00:07:13.470><c> get</c><00:07:13.620><c> like</c><00:07:13.950><c> improve</c><00:07:14.220><c> my</c><00:07:14.340><c> passing</c>

00:07:14.750 --> 00:07:14.760 align:start position:0%
do is like get like improve my passing
 

00:07:14.760 --> 00:07:16.220 align:start position:0%
do is like get like improve my passing
game<00:07:14.880><c> but</c><00:07:15.060><c> your</c><00:07:15.240><c> does</c><00:07:15.690><c> that</c><00:07:15.780><c> make</c><00:07:15.930><c> sense</c><00:07:15.960><c> like</c>

00:07:16.220 --> 00:07:16.230 align:start position:0%
game but your does that make sense like
 

00:07:16.230 --> 00:07:18.230 align:start position:0%
game but your does that make sense like
you're<00:07:16.350><c> actually</c><00:07:16.500><c> you're</c><00:07:17.250><c> you</c><00:07:17.730><c> think</c><00:07:17.760><c> you're</c>

00:07:18.230 --> 00:07:18.240 align:start position:0%
you're actually you're you think you're
 

00:07:18.240 --> 00:07:19.910 align:start position:0%
you're actually you're you think you're
doing<00:07:18.570><c> the</c><00:07:18.690><c> thing</c><00:07:18.900><c> that</c><00:07:19.080><c> you're</c><00:07:19.200><c> not</c><00:07:19.380><c> doing</c><00:07:19.770><c> so</c>

00:07:19.910 --> 00:07:19.920 align:start position:0%
doing the thing that you're not doing so
 

00:07:19.920 --> 00:07:21.200 align:start position:0%
doing the thing that you're not doing so
no<00:07:20.070><c> wonder</c><00:07:20.280><c> it's</c><00:07:20.460><c> not</c><00:07:20.490><c> working</c><00:07:20.880><c> because</c><00:07:20.970><c> you</c>

00:07:21.200 --> 00:07:21.210 align:start position:0%
no wonder it's not working because you
 

00:07:21.210 --> 00:07:22.190 align:start position:0%
no wonder it's not working because you
think<00:07:21.330><c> you're</c><00:07:21.480><c> doing</c><00:07:21.690><c> something</c><00:07:21.870><c> entirely</c>

00:07:22.190 --> 00:07:22.200 align:start position:0%
think you're doing something entirely
 

00:07:22.200 --> 00:07:24.140 align:start position:0%
think you're doing something entirely
different<00:07:22.820><c> Yeah</c><00:07:23.820><c> right</c>

00:11:07.500 --> 00:11:11.780 align:start position:0%
this way and I need to implement actions
to<00:11:08.190><c> change</c><00:11:08.460><c> the</c><00:11:08.700><c> person</c><00:11:08.910><c> that</c><00:11:09.150><c> I</c><00:11:09.180><c> am</c><00:11:10.610><c> how</c><00:11:11.610><c> would</c>

00:11:11.780 --> 00:11:11.790 align:start position:0%
to change the person that I am how would
 

00:11:11.790 --> 00:11:14.810 align:start position:0%
to change the person that I am how would
that<00:11:11.910><c> work</c><00:11:11.970><c> with</c><00:11:12.270><c> your</c><00:11:12.390><c> kid</c><00:11:13.580><c> she</c><00:11:14.580><c> wouldn't</c>

00:11:14.810 --> 00:11:14.820 align:start position:0%
that work with your kid she wouldn't
 

00:11:14.820 --> 00:11:18.790 align:start position:0%
that work with your kid she wouldn't
understand<00:11:15.210><c> what</c><00:11:15.330><c> I</c><00:11:15.360><c> was</c><00:11:15.540><c> telling</c><00:11:15.810><c> her</c><00:11:15.930><c> yes</c>

00:11:18.790 --> 00:11:18.800 align:start position:0%
 
 

00:11:18.800 --> 00:11:21.590 align:start position:0%
 
and<00:11:19.800><c> so</c><00:11:20.160><c> I</c><00:11:20.190><c> think</c><00:11:20.310><c> what</c><00:11:20.610><c> you</c><00:11:20.730><c> need</c><00:11:20.760><c> to</c><00:11:21.060><c> learn</c><00:11:21.270><c> is</c>

00:11:21.590 --> 00:11:21.600 align:start position:0%
and so I think what you need to learn is
 

00:11:21.600 --> 00:11:25.520 align:start position:0%
and so I think what you need to learn is
like<00:11:21.840><c> how</c><00:11:22.230><c> to</c><00:11:22.260><c> talk</c><00:11:22.680><c> to</c><00:11:22.890><c> yourself</c><00:11:24.170><c> and</c><00:11:25.170><c> instead</c>

00:11:25.520 --> 00:11:25.530 align:start position:0%
like how to talk to yourself and instead
 

00:11:25.530 --> 00:11:27.530 align:start position:0%
like how to talk to yourself and instead
of<00:11:25.710><c> like</c><00:11:25.860><c> being</c><00:11:26.160><c> you</c><00:11:26.880><c> know</c><00:11:27.000><c> instead</c><00:11:27.360><c> of</c><00:11:27.420><c> being</c>

00:11:27.530 --> 00:11:27.540 align:start position:0%
of like being you know instead of being
 

00:11:27.540 --> 00:11:30.170 align:start position:0%
of like being you know instead of being
so<00:11:28.020><c> corrective</c><00:11:28.890><c> be</c><00:11:29.730><c> a</c><00:11:29.760><c> little</c><00:11:30.060><c> bit</c>

00:11:30.170 --> 00:11:30.180 align:start position:0%
so corrective be a little bit
 

00:11:30.180 --> 00:11:35.150 align:start position:0%
so corrective be a little bit
compassionate<00:11:32.570><c> yeah</c><00:11:33.570><c> are</c><00:11:34.110><c> you</c><00:11:34.890><c> nice</c><00:11:35.130><c> to</c>
