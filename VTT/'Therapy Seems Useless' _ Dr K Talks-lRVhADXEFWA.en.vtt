00:02:45.920 --> 00:02:48.470 align:start position:0%
so so what we're going to talk about
right<00:02:46.080><c> now</c><00:02:46.400><c> is</c><00:02:46.560><c> how</c><00:02:46.879><c> shame</c><00:02:47.519><c> literally</c><00:02:48.080><c> shapes</c>

00:02:48.470 --> 00:02:48.480 align:start position:0%
right now is how shame literally shapes

okay
 

00:02:52.239 --> 00:02:53.830 align:start position:0%
okay
so<00:02:52.400><c> the</c><00:02:52.560><c> first</c><00:02:52.720><c> thing</c><00:02:52.959><c> to</c><00:02:53.120><c> understand</c><00:02:53.519><c> about</c>

00:02:53.830 --> 00:02:53.840 align:start position:0%
so the first thing to understand about
 

00:02:53.840 --> 00:02:55.990 align:start position:0%
so the first thing to understand about
therapy<00:02:54.640><c> is</c><00:02:54.879><c> that</c>

00:02:55.990 --> 00:02:56.000 align:start position:0%
therapy is that
 

00:02:56.000 --> 00:02:57.990 align:start position:0%
therapy is that
it<00:02:56.160><c> doesn't</c><00:02:56.560><c> solve</c><00:02:56.959><c> everything</c><00:02:57.360><c> at</c><00:02:57.440><c> once</c><00:02:57.760><c> you</c>

00:02:57.990 --> 00:02:58.000 align:start position:0%
it doesn't solve everything at once you
 

00:02:58.000 --> 00:03:00.470 align:start position:0%
it doesn't solve everything at once you
have<00:02:58.159><c> to</c><00:02:58.319><c> start</c><00:02:58.720><c> somewhere</c><00:02:59.440><c> okay</c>

00:03:00.470 --> 00:03:00.480 align:start position:0%
have to start somewhere okay
 

00:03:00.480 --> 00:03:02.070 align:start position:0%
have to start somewhere okay
and<00:03:00.640><c> so</c><00:03:00.800><c> if</c><00:03:00.879><c> you're</c><00:03:01.120><c> someone</c><00:03:01.440><c> who</c><00:03:01.760><c> has</c>

00:03:02.070 --> 00:03:02.080 align:start position:0%
and so if you're someone who has
 

00:03:02.080 --> 00:03:03.750 align:start position:0%
and so if you're someone who has
crippling<00:03:02.640><c> shame</c><00:03:02.959><c> and</c><00:03:03.040><c> it</c><00:03:03.200><c> sounds</c><00:03:03.440><c> like</c><00:03:03.519><c> this</c>

doesn't seem like it's gonna change
 

00:03:35.519 --> 00:03:36.309 align:start position:0%
doesn't seem like it's gonna change
so

00:03:36.309 --> 00:03:36.319 align:start position:0%
so
 

00:03:36.319 --> 00:03:38.789 align:start position:0%
so
the<00:03:36.560><c> more</c>

00:03:38.789 --> 00:03:38.799 align:start position:0%
the more

00:03:42.070 --> 00:03:42.080 align:start position:0%
the harder the shame is to overcome the

the harder the shame is to overcome the

00:03:44.400 --> 00:03:45.670 align:start position:0%
longer time it's gonna take to overcome
it

00:03:45.670 --> 00:03:45.680 align:start position:0%
it
 

00:03:45.680 --> 00:03:48.550 align:start position:0%
it
and<00:03:46.319><c> the</c><00:03:46.640><c> harder</c><00:03:46.959><c> it's</c><00:03:47.120><c> going</c><00:03:47.280><c> to</c><00:03:47.760><c> be</c><00:03:48.080><c> to</c><00:03:48.319><c> see</c>

00:03:48.550 --> 00:03:48.560 align:start position:0%
and the harder it's going to be to see
 

00:03:48.560 --> 00:03:50.630 align:start position:0%
and the harder it's going to be to see
the<00:03:48.720><c> progress</c><00:03:49.280><c> that</c><00:03:49.440><c> you're</c><00:03:49.599><c> making</c>

the progress that you're making
 

00:03:50.640 --> 00:03:52.390 align:start position:0%
the progress that you're making

00:03:52.390 --> 00:03:52.400 align:start position:0%
so there's also something that's kind of
 

00:03:52.400 --> 00:03:55.350 align:start position:0%
so there's also something that's kind of
dangerous<00:03:52.959><c> going</c><00:03:53.200><c> on</c><00:03:53.439><c> here</c>

00:03:55.350 --> 00:03:55.360 align:start position:0%

00:03:57.750 --> 00:03:57.760 align:start position:0%
don't know if this is going to make
 

00:03:57.760 --> 00:03:58.630 align:start position:0%
don't know if this is going to make

00:03:58.630 --> 00:03:58.640 align:start position:0%
sense
 

00:03:58.640 --> 00:03:59.990 align:start position:0%

but<00:03:58.799><c> this</c><00:03:58.959><c> is</c><00:03:59.120><c> almost</c><00:03:59.439><c> like</c><00:03:59.599><c> more</c><00:03:59.760><c> for</c>

00:03:59.990 --> 00:04:00.000 align:start position:0%
but this is almost like more for

clinicians
 

00:04:01.519 --> 00:04:04.789 align:start position:0%

00:04:55.030 --> 00:04:55.040 align:start position:0%
dangerous conclusion to come to and so
 

00:04:55.040 --> 00:04:57.189 align:start position:0%
dangerous conclusion to come to and so
the<00:04:55.120><c> more</c><00:04:55.440><c> things</c><00:04:55.680><c> that</c><00:04:55.840><c> you</c><00:04:56.080><c> try</c><00:04:56.880><c> and</c><00:04:57.040><c> the</c>

00:04:57.189 --> 00:04:57.199 align:start position:0%
the more things that you try and the

00:04:59.189 --> 00:04:59.199 align:start position:0%
more things that fail
 

00:04:59.199 --> 00:05:01.830 align:start position:0%
more things that fail
like<00:04:59.360><c> the</c><00:04:59.520><c> more</c><00:04:59.840><c> hopeless</c><00:05:00.320><c> you</c><00:05:00.400><c> become</c><00:05:01.280><c> which</c>

00:05:01.830 --> 00:05:01.840 align:start position:0%
like the more hopeless you become which
 

00:05:01.840 --> 00:05:04.150 align:start position:0%
like the more hopeless you become which
improves<00:05:02.320><c> the</c><00:05:02.479><c> cycle</c><00:05:02.880><c> of</c><00:05:02.960><c> desperation</c><00:05:03.919><c> right</c>

00:05:04.150 --> 00:05:04.160 align:start position:0%
improves the cycle of desperation right
 

00:05:04.160 --> 00:05:06.070 align:start position:0%
improves the cycle of desperation right
like<00:05:04.320><c> so</c><00:05:04.479><c> then</c><00:05:04.639><c> i</c><00:05:04.800><c> become</c><00:05:05.039><c> more</c><00:05:05.280><c> desperate</c><00:05:05.919><c> as</c>

00:05:06.070 --> 00:05:06.080 align:start position:0%
like so then i become more desperate as
 

00:05:06.080 --> 00:05:07.909 align:start position:0%
like so then i become more desperate as
a<00:05:06.160><c> provider</c><00:05:06.639><c> and</c><00:05:06.800><c> now</c><00:05:07.039><c> like</c><00:05:07.280><c> i'm</c><00:05:07.600><c> forced</c><00:05:07.840><c> to</c>
