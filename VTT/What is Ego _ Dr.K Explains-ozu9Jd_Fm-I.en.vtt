eye-feeling
 

00:00:38.600 --> 00:00:40.840 align:start position:0%
eye-feeling

00:06:12.290 --> 00:06:12.300 align:start position:0%
that's absolutely what the ego is
 

00:06:12.300 --> 00:06:15.110 align:start position:0%
that's absolutely what the ego is

00:06:20.120 --> 00:06:20.130 align:start position:0%
right that's how she and then her value
 

00:06:20.130 --> 00:06:22.130 align:start position:0%
right that's how she and then her value

the people it is and the main reason for
 

00:14:03.480 --> 00:14:05.180 align:start position:0%
the people it is and the main reason for
that<00:14:03.660><c> is</c><00:14:03.750><c> because</c><00:14:04.050><c> most</c><00:14:04.199><c> streamers</c><00:14:04.680><c> are</c><00:14:04.829><c> young</c>

00:14:05.180 --> 00:14:05.190 align:start position:0%
that is because most streamers are young
 

00:14:05.190 --> 00:14:07.160 align:start position:0%
that is because most streamers are young

00:15:41.379 --> 00:15:41.389 align:start position:0%
like is essentially you know when
 

00:15:41.389 --> 00:15:44.199 align:start position:0%
like is essentially you know when
someone<00:15:42.189><c> perceives</c><00:15:43.189><c> a</c><00:15:43.429><c> lot</c><00:15:43.609><c> of</c><00:15:43.790><c> negative</c>

00:15:44.199 --> 00:15:44.209 align:start position:0%
someone perceives a lot of negative
 

00:15:44.209 --> 00:15:47.739 align:start position:0%
someone perceives a lot of negative
things<00:15:44.239><c> and</c><00:15:45.220><c> suffers</c><00:15:46.220><c> a</c><00:15:46.249><c> lot</c><00:15:46.489><c> from</c><00:15:46.850><c> either</c>

00:15:47.739 --> 00:15:47.749 align:start position:0%
things and suffers a lot from either
 

00:15:47.749 --> 00:15:51.249 align:start position:0%
things and suffers a lot from either
rejections<00:15:48.649><c> or</c><00:15:48.859><c> perceived</c><00:15:49.339><c> rejections</c><00:15:50.230><c> so</c><00:15:51.230><c> I</c>

00:15:51.249 --> 00:15:51.259 align:start position:0%
rejections or perceived rejections so I
 

00:15:51.259 --> 00:15:55.120 align:start position:0%
rejections or perceived rejections so I
think<00:15:51.379><c> this</c><00:15:51.679><c> has</c><00:15:52.100><c> to</c><00:15:52.129><c> do</c><00:15:52.399><c> a</c><00:15:52.429><c> lot</c><00:15:52.669><c> with</c>

00:15:55.120 --> 00:15:55.130 align:start position:0%
 
 

00:15:55.130 --> 00:15:57.430 align:start position:0%
 
yeah<00:15:55.490><c> so</c><00:15:55.790><c> so</c><00:15:56.180><c> I</c><00:15:56.390><c> mean</c><00:15:56.510><c> it</c><00:15:56.600><c> makes</c><00:15:57.200><c> a</c><00:15:57.290><c> lot</c><00:15:57.410><c> of</c>

00:15:57.430 --> 00:15:57.440 align:start position:0%
yeah so so I mean it makes a lot of
 

00:15:57.440 --> 00:15:58.840 align:start position:0%
yeah so so I mean it makes a lot of
sense<00:15:57.620><c> to</c><00:15:57.710><c> me</c><00:15:57.800><c> too</c><00:15:58.010><c> I</c><00:15:58.040><c> wasn't</c><00:15:58.400><c> sure</c><00:15:58.580><c> if</c><00:15:58.730><c> there</c>

00:15:58.840 --> 00:15:58.850 align:start position:0%
sense to me too I wasn't sure if there
 

00:15:58.850 --> 00:16:00.430 align:start position:0%
sense to me too I wasn't sure if there
was<00:15:58.970><c> like</c><00:15:59.090><c> a</c><00:15:59.120><c> particular</c><00:15:59.660><c> definition</c><00:16:00.230><c> of</c><00:16:00.290><c> it</c>

00:16:00.430 --> 00:16:00.440 align:start position:0%
was like a particular definition of it
 

00:16:00.440 --> 00:16:02.740 align:start position:0%
was like a particular definition of it
that<00:16:00.560><c> I</c><00:16:00.590><c> was</c><00:16:00.710><c> unfamiliar</c><00:16:01.130><c> with</c><00:16:01.420><c> so</c><00:16:02.420><c> this</c><00:16:02.540><c> makes</c>

00:16:02.740 --> 00:16:02.750 align:start position:0%
that I was unfamiliar with so this makes
 

00:16:02.750 --> 00:16:04.270 align:start position:0%
that I was unfamiliar with so this makes
a<00:16:02.840><c> lot</c><00:16:02.930><c> of</c><00:16:02.990><c> sense</c><00:16:03.230><c> to</c><00:16:03.290><c> me</c><00:16:03.440><c> so</c><00:16:03.560><c> I</c><00:16:03.590><c> think</c><00:16:03.710><c> this</c>

00:16:04.270 --> 00:16:04.280 align:start position:0%
a lot of sense to me so I think this
 

00:16:04.280 --> 00:16:06.310 align:start position:0%
a lot of sense to me so I think this
goes<00:16:04.520><c> back</c><00:16:04.760><c> to</c><00:16:04.790><c> some</c><00:16:05.390><c> ideas</c><00:16:05.870><c> behind</c><00:16:06.200><c> like</c>

00:16:06.310 --> 00:16:06.320 align:start position:0%
goes back to some ideas behind like
 

00:16:06.320 --> 00:16:08.200 align:start position:0%
goes back to some ideas behind like
cognitive<00:16:06.830><c> bias</c><00:16:07.040><c> and</c><00:16:07.430><c> actually</c><00:16:07.760><c> senses</c><00:16:08.120><c> of</c>

00:16:08.200 --> 00:16:08.210 align:start position:0%
cognitive bias and actually senses of
 

00:16:08.210 --> 00:16:10.600 align:start position:0%
cognitive bias and actually senses of
identity<00:16:08.660><c> so</c><00:16:09.320><c> when</c><00:16:09.440><c> we</c><00:16:09.620><c> approach</c><00:16:09.950><c> like</c><00:16:10.220><c> this</c>

00:16:10.600 --> 00:16:10.610 align:start position:0%
identity so when we approach like this
 

00:16:10.610 --> 00:16:12.160 align:start position:0%
identity so when we approach like this
kind<00:16:10.880><c> of</c><00:16:10.970><c> mental</c><00:16:11.330><c> stuff</c><00:16:11.510><c> I</c><00:16:11.720><c> actually</c><00:16:11.810><c> think</c>

00:16:12.160 --> 00:16:12.170 align:start position:0%
kind of mental stuff I actually think
 

00:16:12.170 --> 00:16:14.020 align:start position:0%
kind of mental stuff I actually think
Eastern<00:16:12.650><c> perspectives</c><00:16:13.340><c> are</c><00:16:13.520><c> better</c><00:16:13.760><c> than</c>

00:16:14.020 --> 00:16:14.030 align:start position:0%
Eastern perspectives are better than
 

00:16:14.030 --> 00:16:16.840 align:start position:0%
Eastern perspectives are better than

now you're gonna break up with me
 

00:17:21.080 --> 00:17:23.500 align:start position:0%
now you're gonna break up with me

00:17:23.500 --> 00:17:23.510 align:start position:0%
because now you're mad and then the the
 

00:17:23.510 --> 00:17:26.770 align:start position:0%
because now you're mad and then the the
the<00:17:24.140><c> more</c><00:17:24.410><c> like</c><00:17:24.920><c> I</c><00:17:25.280><c> insist</c><00:17:25.970><c> that</c><00:17:26.120><c> this</c><00:17:26.450><c> person</c>

00:17:26.770 --> 00:17:26.780 align:start position:0%
the more like I insist that this person
 

00:17:26.780 --> 00:17:28.150 align:start position:0%
the more like I insist that this person
is<00:17:26.900><c> going</c><00:17:26.990><c> to</c><00:17:27.050><c> break</c><00:17:27.200><c> up</c><00:17:27.380><c> with</c><00:17:27.500><c> me</c><00:17:27.650><c> the</c><00:17:28.040><c> more</c>

00:17:28.150 --> 00:17:28.160 align:start position:0%
is going to break up with me the more
 

00:17:28.160 --> 00:17:30.310 align:start position:0%
is going to break up with me the more
frustrated<00:17:28.790><c> that</c><00:17:28.940><c> they</c><00:17:29.060><c> get</c><00:17:29.270><c> and</c><00:17:29.510><c> the</c><00:17:30.080><c> more</c>

00:17:30.310 --> 00:17:30.320 align:start position:0%
frustrated that they get and the more
 

00:17:30.320 --> 00:17:31.870 align:start position:0%
frustrated that they get and the more
that<00:17:30.620><c> like</c><00:17:30.740><c> I</c><00:17:30.920><c> feel</c><00:17:31.280><c> like</c><00:17:31.430><c> this</c><00:17:31.610><c> is</c><00:17:31.760><c> actually</c>

00:17:31.870 --> 00:17:31.880 align:start position:0%
that like I feel like this is actually
 

00:17:31.880 --> 00:17:34.030 align:start position:0%
that like I feel like this is actually
happening<00:17:32.540><c> and</c><00:17:32.720><c> so</c><00:17:33.290><c> it</c><00:17:33.350><c> becomes</c><00:17:33.590><c> kind</c><00:17:33.800><c> of</c><00:17:33.950><c> a</c>

00:17:34.030 --> 00:17:34.040 align:start position:0%
happening and so it becomes kind of a
 

00:17:34.040 --> 00:17:35.200 align:start position:0%
happening and so it becomes kind of a
self-fulfilling<00:17:34.370><c> prophecy</c>

00:17:35.200 --> 00:17:35.210 align:start position:0%
self-fulfilling prophecy
 

00:17:35.210 --> 00:17:37.720 align:start position:0%
self-fulfilling prophecy
and<00:17:35.740><c> so</c><00:17:36.740><c> this</c><00:17:36.890><c> is</c><00:17:37.070><c> a</c><00:17:37.100><c> problem</c><00:17:37.490><c> because</c><00:17:37.580><c> the</c>

00:17:37.720 --> 00:17:37.730 align:start position:0%
and so this is a problem because the
 

00:17:37.730 --> 00:17:40.000 align:start position:0%
and so this is a problem because the
mind<00:17:38.120><c> has</c><00:17:38.360><c> this</c><00:17:38.600><c> bias</c><00:17:38.900><c> for</c><00:17:39.350><c> like</c><00:17:39.500><c> the</c><00:17:39.620><c> kind</c><00:17:39.890><c> of</c>

00:17:40.000 --> 00:17:40.010 align:start position:0%
mind has this bias for like the kind of
 

00:17:40.010 --> 00:17:44.220 align:start position:0%
mind has this bias for like the kind of
information<00:17:40.640><c> that</c><00:17:40.910><c> it</c><00:17:41.600><c> interprets</c>

00:17:44.220 --> 00:17:44.230 align:start position:0%
information that it interprets
 

00:17:44.230 --> 00:17:46.860 align:start position:0%
information that it interprets
and<00:17:44.320><c> so</c><00:17:45.149><c> when</c><00:17:46.149><c> it</c><00:17:46.240><c> comes</c><00:17:46.389><c> to</c><00:17:46.510><c> rejection</c>

00:17:46.860 --> 00:17:46.870 align:start position:0%
and so when it comes to rejection
 

00:17:46.870 --> 00:17:49.320 align:start position:0%
and so when it comes to rejection
sensitivity<00:17:47.610><c> this</c><00:17:48.610><c> is</c><00:17:48.820><c> a</c><00:17:48.850><c> problem</c>

00:17:49.320 --> 00:17:49.330 align:start position:0%
sensitivity this is a problem
 

00:17:49.330 --> 00:17:51.480 align:start position:0%
sensitivity this is a problem
essentially<00:17:49.899><c> of</c><00:17:49.990><c> confidence</c><00:17:50.559><c> so</c><00:17:51.220><c> there's</c><00:17:51.399><c> a</c>

00:17:51.480 --> 00:17:51.490 align:start position:0%
essentially of confidence so there's a
 

00:17:51.490 --> 00:17:53.370 align:start position:0%
essentially of confidence so there's a
weird<00:17:51.909><c> thing</c><00:17:52.269><c> that</c><00:17:52.330><c> happens</c><00:17:52.840><c> to</c><00:17:52.990><c> their</c><00:17:53.139><c> ahum</c>

00:17:53.370 --> 00:17:53.380 align:start position:0%
weird thing that happens to their ahum
 

00:17:53.380 --> 00:17:55.409 align:start position:0%
weird thing that happens to their ahum
car<00:17:53.620><c> where</c><00:17:54.340><c> they</c><00:17:54.519><c> believe</c><00:17:54.940><c> that</c><00:17:54.970><c> they</c><00:17:55.389><c> are</c>

00:17:55.409 --> 00:17:55.419 align:start position:0%
car where they believe that they are
 

00:17:55.419 --> 00:17:58.080 align:start position:0%
car where they believe that they are
like<00:17:55.690><c> not</c><00:17:55.929><c> like</c><00:17:56.830><c> worthwhile</c><00:17:57.370><c> human</c><00:17:57.700><c> beings</c>

00:17:58.080 --> 00:17:58.090 align:start position:0%
like not like worthwhile human beings
 

00:17:58.090 --> 00:18:01.080 align:start position:0%
like not like worthwhile human beings
and<00:17:58.440><c> so</c><00:17:59.440><c> what</c><00:17:59.590><c> happens</c><00:17:59.980><c> is</c><00:18:00.190><c> that</c><00:18:00.370><c> there's</c><00:18:01.029><c> a</c>

00:18:01.080 --> 00:18:01.090 align:start position:0%
and so what happens is that there's a
 

00:18:01.090 --> 00:18:02.460 align:start position:0%
and so what happens is that there's a
there's<00:18:01.539><c> actually</c><00:18:01.659><c> like</c><00:18:01.960><c> there's</c><00:18:02.110><c> there</c>

00:18:02.460 --> 00:18:02.470 align:start position:0%
there's actually like there's there
 

00:18:02.470 --> 00:18:03.899 align:start position:0%
there's actually like there's there
studies<00:18:02.799><c> that</c><00:18:02.919><c> should</c><00:18:03.130><c> sort</c><00:18:03.429><c> of</c><00:18:03.490><c> show</c><00:18:03.730><c> this</c>

00:18:39.990 --> 00:18:43.100 align:start position:0%
 
you

00:18:43.100 --> 00:18:43.110 align:start position:0%
 
 

00:18:43.110 --> 00:18:47.080 align:start position:0%
 
absolutely<00:18:44.110><c> right</c>

00:18:47.080 --> 00:18:47.090 align:start position:0%
 
 

00:18:47.090 --> 00:18:51.400 align:start position:0%
 
you<00:18:47.630><c> you</c><00:18:48.620><c> don't</c><00:18:48.740><c> you</c><00:18:48.950><c> don't</c><00:18:49.130><c> accept</c><00:18:49.400><c> it</c><00:18:50.410><c> yeah</c>

00:18:51.400 --> 00:18:51.410 align:start position:0%
you you don't you don't accept it yeah
 

00:18:51.410 --> 00:18:53.950 align:start position:0%
you you don't you don't accept it yeah
so<00:18:52.400><c> now</c><00:18:52.580><c> now</c><00:18:52.940><c> just</c><00:18:53.210><c> think</c><00:18:53.390><c> about</c><00:18:53.450><c> that</c><00:18:53.750><c> for</c><00:18:53.810><c> a</c>

00:18:53.950 --> 00:18:53.960 align:start position:0%
so now now just think about that for a
 

00:18:53.960 --> 00:18:55.870 align:start position:0%
so now now just think about that for a
second<00:18:54.260><c> right</c><00:18:54.350><c> like</c><00:18:54.560><c> so</c><00:18:54.710><c> imagine</c><00:18:55.610><c> that</c><00:18:55.640><c> you</c>

00:18:55.870 --> 00:18:55.880 align:start position:0%
second right like so imagine that you
 

00:18:55.880 --> 00:18:58.720 align:start position:0%
second right like so imagine that you
have<00:18:56.150><c> a</c><00:18:56.180><c> brain</c><00:18:56.650><c> that</c><00:18:57.650><c> is</c><00:18:57.950><c> being</c><00:18:58.310><c> presented</c>

00:18:58.720 --> 00:18:58.730 align:start position:0%
have a brain that is being presented
 

00:18:58.730 --> 00:19:00.700 align:start position:0%
have a brain that is being presented
with<00:18:58.970><c> positive</c><00:18:59.660><c> data</c><00:18:59.840><c> but</c><00:19:00.200><c> then</c><00:19:00.320><c> you</c><00:19:00.470><c> just</c>

00:19:00.700 --> 00:19:00.710 align:start position:0%
with positive data but then you just
 

00:19:00.710 --> 00:19:03.310 align:start position:0%
with positive data but then you just
discount<00:19:01.130><c> the</c><00:19:01.280><c> data</c><00:19:01.720><c> right</c><00:19:02.720><c> like</c><00:19:03.020><c> you</c><00:19:03.140><c> just</c>

00:19:03.310 --> 00:19:03.320 align:start position:0%
discount the data right like you just
 

00:19:03.320 --> 00:19:06.220 align:start position:0%
discount the data right like you just
throw<00:19:03.590><c> it</c><00:19:03.740><c> out</c><00:19:03.830><c> and</c><00:19:04.510><c> then</c><00:19:05.510><c> what</c><00:19:05.660><c> happens</c><00:19:05.990><c> isn't</c>

00:19:06.220 --> 00:19:06.230 align:start position:0%
throw it out and then what happens isn't
 

00:19:06.230 --> 00:19:07.600 align:start position:0%
throw it out and then what happens isn't
when<00:19:06.380><c> there's</c><00:19:06.530><c> negative</c><00:19:06.920><c> data</c><00:19:07.070><c> like</c><00:19:07.310><c> that</c>

00:19:07.600 --> 00:19:07.610 align:start position:0%
when there's negative data like that
 

00:19:07.610 --> 00:19:08.980 align:start position:0%
when there's negative data like that
we're<00:19:07.850><c> gonna</c><00:19:07.940><c> accept</c><00:19:08.360><c> like</c><00:19:08.600><c> that's</c><00:19:08.810><c> a</c>

00:19:08.980 --> 00:19:08.990 align:start position:0%
we're gonna accept like that's a
 

00:19:08.990 --> 00:19:11.050 align:start position:0%
we're gonna accept like that's a
legitimate<00:19:09.530><c> that's</c><00:19:10.010><c> a</c><00:19:10.130><c> legitimate</c><00:19:10.640><c> judgment</c>

00:19:11.050 --> 00:19:11.060 align:start position:0%
legitimate that's a legitimate judgment
 

00:19:11.060 --> 00:19:13.060 align:start position:0%
legitimate that's a legitimate judgment
do<00:19:11.480><c> you</c><00:19:11.540><c> think</c><00:19:11.720><c> I'm</c><00:19:11.840><c> a</c><00:19:11.870><c> [ __ ]</c><00:19:12.320><c> I</c><00:19:12.590><c> can</c><00:19:12.950><c> get</c>

00:19:13.060 --> 00:19:13.070 align:start position:0%
do you think I'm a [ __ ] I can get
 

00:19:13.070 --> 00:19:13.720 align:start position:0%
do you think I'm a [ __ ] I can get
behind<00:19:13.220><c> that</c>

00:19:13.720 --> 00:19:13.730 align:start position:0%
behind that
 

00:19:13.730 --> 00:19:16.180 align:start position:0%
behind that
but<00:19:14.420><c> if</c><00:19:14.510><c> you</c><00:19:14.570><c> think</c><00:19:14.690><c> I'm</c><00:19:14.840><c> a</c><00:19:14.870><c> good</c><00:19:14.960><c> person</c><00:19:15.110><c> no</c><00:19:15.920><c> no</c>

00:19:16.180 --> 00:19:16.190 align:start position:0%
but if you think I'm a good person no no
 

00:19:16.190 --> 00:19:19.810 align:start position:0%
but if you think I'm a good person no no
no<00:19:16.340><c> you're</c><00:19:16.850><c> wrong</c><00:19:17.120><c> right</c><00:19:17.950><c> and</c><00:19:18.950><c> so</c><00:19:19.550><c> then</c><00:19:19.700><c> what</c>

00:19:19.810 --> 00:19:19.820 align:start position:0%
no you're wrong right and so then what
 

00:19:19.820 --> 00:19:23.350 align:start position:0%
no you're wrong right and so then what
happens<00:19:20.210><c> is</c><00:19:20.360><c> it</c><00:19:20.440><c> reinforces</c><00:19:21.730><c> your</c><00:19:22.730><c> settle</c>

00:19:23.350 --> 00:19:23.360 align:start position:0%
happens is it reinforces your settle
 

00:19:23.360 --> 00:19:25.030 align:start position:0%
happens is it reinforces your settle
your<00:19:23.510><c> lack</c><00:19:23.690><c> of</c><00:19:23.930><c> confidence</c><00:19:24.350><c> because</c><00:19:24.710><c> all</c><00:19:24.980><c> of</c>

00:19:25.030 --> 00:19:25.040 align:start position:0%
your lack of confidence because all of
 

00:19:25.040 --> 00:19:27.850 align:start position:0%
your lack of confidence because all of
the<00:19:25.430><c> positive</c><00:19:26.000><c> information</c><00:19:26.710><c> that</c><00:19:27.710><c> you're</c>

00:19:27.850 --> 00:19:27.860 align:start position:0%
the positive information that you're
 

00:19:27.860 --> 00:19:29.620 align:start position:0%
the positive information that you're
receiving<00:19:28.130><c> actually</c><00:19:28.940><c> gets</c><00:19:29.120><c> thrown</c><00:19:29.330><c> out</c><00:19:29.510><c> the</c>

00:19:29.620 --> 00:19:29.630 align:start position:0%
receiving actually gets thrown out the
 

00:19:29.630 --> 00:19:31.220 align:start position:0%
receiving actually gets thrown out the
window

00:19:31.220 --> 00:19:31.230 align:start position:0%
window
 

00:19:31.230 --> 00:19:34.820 align:start position:0%
window
and<00:19:31.320><c> then</c><00:19:32.780><c> then</c><00:19:33.780><c> what</c><00:19:33.960><c> happens</c><00:19:34.320><c> is</c><00:19:34.440><c> like</c><00:19:34.559><c> it</c>

00:19:34.820 --> 00:19:34.830 align:start position:0%
and then then what happens is like it
 

00:19:34.830 --> 00:19:36.500 align:start position:0%
and then then what happens is like it
only<00:19:35.070><c> reinforces</c><00:19:35.429><c> it</c><00:19:35.910><c> so</c><00:19:36.030><c> then</c><00:19:36.179><c> you</c><00:19:36.210><c> kind</c><00:19:36.480><c> of</c>

00:19:36.500 --> 00:19:36.510 align:start position:0%
only reinforces it so then you kind of
 

00:19:36.510 --> 00:19:38.060 align:start position:0%
only reinforces it so then you kind of
get<00:19:36.660><c> into</c><00:19:36.840><c> this</c><00:19:36.990><c> vicious</c><00:19:37.260><c> cycle</c><00:19:37.830><c> that</c><00:19:37.860><c> you</c>

00:19:38.060 --> 00:19:38.070 align:start position:0%
get into this vicious cycle that you
 

00:19:38.070 --> 00:19:40.310 align:start position:0%
get into this vicious cycle that you
kind<00:19:38.280><c> of</c><00:19:38.370><c> can't</c><00:19:38.580><c> get</c><00:19:38.760><c> out</c><00:19:38.910><c> of</c><00:19:39.090><c> because</c><00:19:40.080><c> if</c>

00:19:40.310 --> 00:19:40.320 align:start position:0%
kind of can't get out of because if
 

00:19:40.320 --> 00:19:41.960 align:start position:0%
kind of can't get out of because if
people<00:19:40.500><c> are</c><00:19:40.740><c> trying</c><00:19:41.130><c> to</c><00:19:41.220><c> help</c><00:19:41.549><c> you</c><00:19:41.730><c> if</c><00:19:41.820><c> they're</c>

00:19:44.930 --> 00:19:44.940 align:start position:0%
once again you know I'm convinced that
 

00:19:44.940 --> 00:19:46.520 align:start position:0%
once again you know I'm convinced that
my<00:19:45.120><c> partner</c><00:19:45.419><c> is</c><00:19:45.480><c> gonna</c><00:19:45.540><c> break</c><00:19:45.809><c> up</c><00:19:45.929><c> with</c><00:19:45.960><c> me</c><00:19:46.110><c> my</c>

my partner is gonna break up with me my
 

00:19:46.530 --> 00:19:48.080 align:start position:0%
my partner is gonna break up with me my
partner<00:19:46.919><c> can</c><00:19:47.100><c> be</c><00:19:47.220><c> doing</c><00:19:47.490><c> everything</c><00:19:47.910><c> that</c>

00:19:48.080 --> 00:19:48.090 align:start position:0%
partner can be doing everything that
 

00:19:48.090 --> 00:19:49.610 align:start position:0%
partner can be doing everything that
they<00:19:48.210><c> can</c><00:19:48.330><c> to</c><00:19:48.570><c> reassure</c><00:19:48.990><c> me</c><00:19:49.320><c> and</c><00:19:49.440><c> it's</c><00:19:49.530><c> just</c>

00:19:49.610 --> 00:19:49.620 align:start position:0%
they can to reassure me and it's just
 

00:19:49.620 --> 00:19:52.520 align:start position:0%
they can to reassure me and it's just
not<00:19:49.860><c> sinking</c><00:19:50.370><c> it</c><00:19:50.840><c> and</c><00:19:51.840><c> so</c><00:19:51.990><c> the</c><00:19:52.080><c> reason</c><00:19:52.410><c> for</c>

00:19:52.520 --> 00:19:52.530 align:start position:0%
not sinking it and so the reason for
 

00:19:52.530 --> 00:19:53.990 align:start position:0%
not sinking it and so the reason for
that<00:19:52.590><c> is</c><00:19:52.799><c> because</c><00:19:52.830><c> the</c><00:19:53.160><c> lack</c><00:19:53.370><c> of</c><00:19:53.640><c> self</c>

00:19:53.990 --> 00:19:54.000 align:start position:0%
that is because the lack of self
 

00:19:54.000 --> 00:19:56.659 align:start position:0%
that is because the lack of self
confidence<00:19:54.240><c> actually</c><00:19:55.110><c> comes</c><00:19:55.350><c> from</c><00:19:55.799><c> somewhere</c>

00:19:56.659 --> 00:19:56.669 align:start position:0%
confidence actually comes from somewhere
 

00:19:56.669 --> 00:19:58.970 align:start position:0%

it's<00:28:45.170><c> things</c><00:28:45.440><c> that</c><00:28:45.650><c> you</c><00:28:45.740><c> do</c><00:28:45.950><c> to</c><00:28:45.980><c> yourself</c><00:28:46.220><c> I'll</c>

00:28:46.900 --> 00:28:46.910 align:start position:0%
it's things that you do to yourself I'll
 

00:28:46.910 --> 00:28:48.190 align:start position:0%
it's things that you do to yourself I'll

00:28:51.730 --> 00:28:51.740 align:start position:0%
so eager to stock is ego-dystonic like

so eager to stock is ego-dystonic like
self-destructive<00:28:52.580><c> behavior</c><00:28:54.490><c> so</c><00:28:55.490><c> what's</c><00:28:55.730><c> the</c>

00:28:55.870 --> 00:28:55.880 align:start position:0%
self-destructive behavior so what's the
 

00:28:55.880 --> 00:28:57.460 align:start position:0%
self-destructive behavior so what's the

00:30:26.110 --> 00:30:26.120 align:start position:0%
they don't want to and so when it comes

they don't want to and so when it comes
to<00:30:26.300><c> self-destructive</c><00:30:26.930><c> behavior</c><00:30:27.320><c> a</c><00:30:27.380><c> lot</c><00:30:27.560><c> of</c>

00:30:27.640 --> 00:30:27.650 align:start position:0%
to self-destructive behavior a lot of
 

00:30:27.650 --> 00:30:29.470 align:start position:0%
to self-destructive behavior a lot of
that<00:30:27.770><c> stuff</c><00:30:27.950><c> is</c><00:30:28.190><c> like</c><00:30:28.220><c> ignoring</c><00:30:28.850><c> red</c><00:30:29.150><c> flags</c>

00:30:29.470 --> 00:30:29.480 align:start position:0%
that stuff is like ignoring red flags
 

00:30:29.480 --> 00:30:32.470 align:start position:0%
that stuff is like ignoring red flags
it's<00:30:30.380><c> like</c><00:30:30.710><c> you</c><00:30:31.310><c> know</c><00:30:31.460><c> and</c><00:30:31.670><c> you</c><00:30:32.060><c> think</c><00:30:32.330><c> that</c>

00:30:32.470 --> 00:30:32.480 align:start position:0%
it's like you know and you think that
 

00:30:32.480 --> 00:30:33.970 align:start position:0%
it's like you know and you think that
you're<00:30:32.600><c> doing</c><00:30:32.780><c> everything</c><00:30:33.200><c> right</c><00:30:33.380><c> even</c>

00:30:33.970 --> 00:30:33.980 align:start position:0%
you're doing everything right even
 

00:30:33.980 --> 00:30:35.940 align:start position:0%
you're doing everything right even
though<00:30:34.100><c> you're</c><00:30:34.310><c> doing</c><00:30:34.340><c> everything</c><00:30:35.300><c> wrong</c><00:30:35.570><c> and</c>

00:30:35.940 --> 00:30:35.950 align:start position:0%
though you're doing everything wrong and
 

00:30:35.950 --> 00:30:38.350 align:start position:0%
though you're doing everything wrong and
so<00:30:36.950><c> that</c><00:30:37.100><c> kind</c><00:30:37.340><c> of</c><00:30:37.400><c> self-reflection</c><00:30:37.820><c> is</c>

00:30:38.350 --> 00:30:38.360 align:start position:0%
so that kind of self-reflection is
 

00:30:38.360 --> 00:30:42.060 align:start position:0%
so that kind of self-reflection is
tricky<00:30:38.780><c> and</c><00:30:38.990><c> difficult</c>

00:30:42.060 --> 00:30:42.070 align:start position:0%
 
 

00:30:42.070 --> 00:30:43.710 align:start position:0%
 
yeah<00:30:42.730><c> so</c><00:30:42.940><c> locking</c><00:30:43.300><c> the</c><00:30:43.390><c> door</c><00:30:43.540><c> usually</c>

00:30:43.710 --> 00:30:43.720 align:start position:0%
yeah so locking the door usually
 

00:30:43.720 --> 00:30:47.790 align:start position:0%
yeah so locking the door usually

00:30:47.790 --> 00:30:47.800 align:start position:0%
repetitive behaviors okay well will do
 

00:30:47.800 --> 00:30:49.350 align:start position:0%
repetitive behaviors okay well will do
