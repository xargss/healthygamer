i think in your case there's a double
doozy<00:16:45.120><c> because</c><00:16:45.360><c> it</c><00:16:45.519><c> sounds</c><00:16:45.839><c> like</c><00:16:46.000><c> maybe</c><00:16:46.399><c> you</c>

00:16:46.629 --> 00:16:46.639 align:start position:0%
doozy because it sounds like maybe you

00:16:53.749 --> 00:16:53.759 align:start position:0%
and it sounds like for whatever reason
 

00:16:53.759 --> 00:16:55.910 align:start position:0%
and it sounds like for whatever reason
you<00:16:54.000><c> shot</c><00:16:54.240><c> them</c><00:16:54.399><c> down</c><00:16:54.800><c> every</c><00:16:54.959><c> single</c><00:16:55.360><c> time</c>

00:16:55.910 --> 00:16:55.920 align:start position:0%
you shot them down every single time
 

00:16:55.920 --> 00:16:57.910 align:start position:0%
you shot them down every single time
and<00:16:56.079><c> so</c><00:16:56.240><c> what</c><00:16:56.399><c> i</c><00:16:56.560><c> would</c><00:16:56.720><c> really</c><00:16:57.120><c> also</c><00:16:57.519><c> look</c><00:16:57.759><c> at</c>

00:16:57.910 --> 00:16:57.920 align:start position:0%
and so what i would really also look at
 

00:16:57.920 --> 00:16:59.189 align:start position:0%
and so what i would really also look at

hurt him the most basically so it sounds
 

00:23:09.600 --> 00:23:10.549 align:start position:0%

00:40:16.710 --> 00:40:16.720 align:start position:0%
were dealt with in a fair way
 

00:40:16.720 --> 00:40:20.069 align:start position:0%
were dealt with in a fair way
yeah<00:40:17.040><c> i</c><00:40:17.280><c> believe</c><00:40:17.680><c> that</c><00:40:18.079><c> it</c><00:40:18.240><c> was</c><00:40:18.640><c> uh</c><00:40:19.599><c> that</c>

00:40:20.069 --> 00:40:20.079 align:start position:0%
yeah i believe that it was uh that
 

00:40:20.079 --> 00:40:22.390 align:start position:0%
yeah i believe that it was uh that
um<00:40:20.640><c> well</c><00:40:21.040><c> more</c><00:40:21.200><c> or</c><00:40:21.280><c> less</c><00:40:21.520><c> i</c><00:40:21.599><c> would</c><00:40:21.760><c> have</c><00:40:22.079><c> maybe</c>

00:40:22.390 --> 00:40:22.400 align:start position:0%
um well more or less i would have maybe
 

00:40:22.400 --> 00:40:23.750 align:start position:0%
um well more or less i would have maybe
had<00:40:22.560><c> a</c><00:40:22.800><c> private</c><00:40:23.280><c> call</c>

00:40:23.750 --> 00:40:23.760 align:start position:0%
had a private call
 

00:40:23.760 --> 00:40:27.670 align:start position:0%
had a private call
not<00:40:24.800><c> on</c><00:40:25.040><c> twitch</c><00:40:25.520><c> but</c><00:40:26.319><c> i</c><00:40:26.560><c> do</c><00:40:26.720><c> believe</c><00:40:27.200><c> that</c><00:40:27.520><c> it</c>

00:40:27.670 --> 00:40:27.680 align:start position:0%
not on twitch but i do believe that it
 

00:40:27.680 --> 00:40:29.750 align:start position:0%
not on twitch but i do believe that it
was<00:40:27.920><c> much</c><00:40:28.160><c> more</c><00:40:28.319><c> better</c><00:40:28.640><c> for</c><00:40:28.800><c> them</c><00:40:29.119><c> to</c><00:40:29.280><c> be</c><00:40:29.440><c> able</c>

00:40:29.750 --> 00:40:29.760 align:start position:0%
was much more better for them to be able
 

00:40:29.760 --> 00:40:30.470 align:start position:0%
was much more better for them to be able
to<00:40:29.920><c> kind</c><00:40:30.079><c> of</c>

00:40:30.470 --> 00:40:30.480 align:start position:0%
to kind of
 

00:40:30.480 --> 00:40:33.510 align:start position:0%
to kind of
speak<00:40:30.880><c> on</c><00:40:30.960><c> their</c><00:40:31.119><c> behalf</c><00:40:31.680><c> and</c><00:40:32.240><c> you</c><00:40:32.400><c> know</c><00:40:33.440><c> you</c>

00:40:33.510 --> 00:40:33.520 align:start position:0%
