00:00:23.590 --> 00:00:23.600 align:start position:0%
now this is kind of a weird video
 

00:00:23.600 --> 00:00:26.550 align:start position:0%
now this is kind of a weird video
because<00:00:24.560><c> in</c><00:00:24.720><c> this</c><00:00:24.960><c> series</c><00:00:25.359><c> on</c><00:00:25.599><c> depression</c>

00:00:26.550 --> 00:00:26.560 align:start position:0%
because in this series on depression
 

00:00:26.560 --> 00:00:28.790 align:start position:0%
because in this series on depression
so<00:00:26.800><c> far</c><00:00:27.119><c> we</c><00:00:27.279><c> may</c><00:00:27.519><c> have</c><00:00:27.599><c> focused</c><00:00:28.000><c> a</c><00:00:28.080><c> lot</c><00:00:28.320><c> on</c><00:00:28.560><c> like</c>

00:00:28.790 --> 00:00:28.800 align:start position:0%
so far we may have focused a lot on like
 

00:00:28.800 --> 00:00:30.310 align:start position:0%
so far we may have focused a lot on like
clinical<00:00:29.279><c> depression</c>

00:00:30.310 --> 00:00:30.320 align:start position:0%
clinical depression
 

00:00:30.320 --> 00:00:33.190 align:start position:0%
clinical depression
or<00:00:30.560><c> what</c><00:00:30.800><c> we</c><00:00:30.960><c> think</c><00:00:31.199><c> of</c><00:00:31.439><c> is</c><00:00:31.599><c> an</c><00:00:31.760><c> illness</c><00:00:33.040><c> right</c>

00:00:33.190 --> 00:00:33.200 align:start position:0%
or what we think of is an illness right
 

00:00:33.200 --> 00:00:34.870 align:start position:0%
or what we think of is an illness right
so<00:00:33.360><c> let's</c><00:00:33.520><c> just</c><00:00:33.760><c> stop</c><00:00:34.000><c> for</c><00:00:34.160><c> a</c><00:00:34.239><c> second</c>

00:00:34.870 --> 00:00:34.880 align:start position:0%
so let's just stop for a second
 

00:00:34.880 --> 00:00:37.510 align:start position:0%
so let's just stop for a second
and<00:00:35.280><c> kind</c><00:00:35.440><c> of</c><00:00:35.600><c> think</c><00:00:35.920><c> through</c><00:00:36.160><c> this</c><00:00:37.280><c> so</c>

00:00:37.510 --> 00:00:37.520 align:start position:0%
and kind of think through this so
 

00:00:37.520 --> 00:00:38.950 align:start position:0%
and kind of think through this so
depression<00:00:38.160><c> right</c><00:00:38.320><c> now</c><00:00:38.559><c> like</c>

00:00:38.950 --> 00:00:38.960 align:start position:0%
depression right now like
 

00:00:38.960 --> 00:00:41.270 align:start position:0%
depression right now like
in<00:00:39.040><c> the</c><00:00:39.200><c> world</c><00:00:40.000><c> and</c><00:00:40.320><c> certainly</c><00:00:40.719><c> in</c><00:00:40.800><c> developed</c>

00:00:41.270 --> 00:00:41.280 align:start position:0%
in the world and certainly in developed
 

00:00:41.280 --> 00:00:43.190 align:start position:0%
in the world and certainly in developed
countries<00:00:41.760><c> seems</c><00:00:42.079><c> to</c><00:00:42.160><c> be</c><00:00:42.320><c> getting</c><00:00:42.640><c> worse</c>

00:00:43.190 --> 00:00:43.200 align:start position:0%
countries seems to be getting worse
 

00:00:43.200 --> 00:00:46.069 align:start position:0%
countries seems to be getting worse
and<00:00:43.440><c> why</c><00:00:43.760><c> is</c><00:00:44.000><c> that</c><00:00:44.800><c> so</c><00:00:45.039><c> it's</c><00:00:45.200><c> my</c><00:00:45.440><c> belief</c><00:00:45.840><c> that</c><00:00:46.000><c> a</c>

00:00:46.069 --> 00:00:46.079 align:start position:0%
and why is that so it's my belief that a
 

00:00:46.079 --> 00:00:47.910 align:start position:0%
and why is that so it's my belief that a
lot<00:00:46.239><c> of</c><00:00:46.399><c> people</c><00:00:46.719><c> are</c><00:00:46.879><c> depressed</c>

lot of people are depressed
 

00:00:47.920 --> 00:00:49.430 align:start position:0%
lot of people are depressed
certainly<00:00:48.239><c> people</c><00:00:48.480><c> are</c><00:00:48.640><c> getting</c><00:00:48.879><c> depressed</c>

00:00:49.430 --> 00:00:49.440 align:start position:0%
certainly people are getting depressed
 

00:00:49.440 --> 00:00:51.670 align:start position:0%
certainly people are getting depressed
and<00:00:49.520><c> then</c><00:00:49.760><c> they</c><00:00:49.920><c> go</c><00:00:50.079><c> to</c><00:00:50.239><c> see</c><00:00:50.399><c> a</c><00:00:50.559><c> psychiatrist</c>

some kind of malfunction
and<00:01:34.960><c> i</c><00:01:35.040><c> think</c><00:01:35.200><c> once</c><00:01:35.439><c> we</c><00:01:35.680><c> think</c><00:01:35.920><c> through</c><00:01:36.159><c> that</c>

00:01:36.630 --> 00:01:36.640 align:start position:0%
and i think once we think through that
 

00:01:36.640 --> 00:01:38.149 align:start position:0%
and i think once we think through that
we'll<00:01:36.880><c> start</c><00:01:37.200><c> to</c><00:01:37.360><c> see</c><00:01:37.759><c> like</c>

00:01:38.149 --> 00:01:38.159 align:start position:0%
we'll start to see like
 

00:01:38.159 --> 00:01:39.910 align:start position:0%
we'll start to see like
how<00:01:38.320><c> to</c><00:01:38.479><c> move</c><00:01:38.720><c> forward</c><00:01:39.280><c> if</c><00:01:39.439><c> we're</c><00:01:39.600><c> not</c>

00:01:39.910 --> 00:01:39.920 align:start position:0%
how to move forward if we're not
 

00:01:39.920 --> 00:01:42.870 align:start position:0%
how to move forward if we're not
actually<00:01:40.400><c> ill</c><00:01:40.720><c> or</c><00:01:40.880><c> malfunctioning</c>

00:01:42.870 --> 00:01:42.880 align:start position:0%
actually ill or malfunctioning
 

00:01:42.880 --> 00:01:44.310 align:start position:0%
actually ill or malfunctioning

00:01:44.310 --> 00:01:44.320 align:start position:0%
so the first thing to think about is
 

00:01:44.320 --> 00:01:46.310 align:start position:0%
so the first thing to think about is
that<00:01:44.479><c> an</c><00:01:44.720><c> illness</c><00:01:45.119><c> is</c><00:01:45.280><c> like</c><00:01:45.439><c> a</c><00:01:45.520><c> malfunction</c>

00:01:46.310 --> 00:01:46.320 align:start position:0%
that an illness is like a malfunction
 

00:01:46.320 --> 00:01:47.990 align:start position:0%
that an illness is like a malfunction
it's<00:01:46.479><c> something</c><00:01:46.799><c> in</c><00:01:46.880><c> your</c><00:01:47.040><c> body</c><00:01:47.360><c> that</c><00:01:47.680><c> isn't</c>

00:01:47.990 --> 00:01:48.000 align:start position:0%
it's something in your body that isn't

it's something in your body that isn't

00:01:49.749 --> 00:01:49.759 align:start position:0%
doing what it's supposed to be doing so
 

00:01:49.759 --> 00:01:51.350 align:start position:0%
doing what it's supposed to be doing so
if<00:01:49.840><c> we</c><00:01:50.000><c> think</c><00:01:50.159><c> about</c><00:01:50.560><c> let's</c><00:01:50.720><c> say</c><00:01:50.880><c> like</c><00:01:51.119><c> getting</c>

our nose is sometimes supposed to

00:01:58.709 --> 00:01:58.719 align:start position:0%
supposed to cough if maybe we get

something stuck in our throat
 

00:02:00.640 --> 00:02:03.270 align:start position:0%
something stuck in our throat
but<00:02:00.880><c> when</c><00:02:01.119><c> we</c><00:02:01.280><c> get</c><00:02:01.520><c> ill</c><00:02:01.840><c> with</c><00:02:02.000><c> a</c><00:02:02.159><c> cold</c><00:02:02.719><c> our</c><00:02:02.880><c> body</c>

but when we get ill with a cold our body
 

00:02:03.280 --> 00:02:05.350 align:start position:0%
but when we get ill with a cold our body
starts<00:02:03.600><c> to</c><00:02:03.840><c> produce</c><00:02:04.240><c> way</c><00:02:04.479><c> more</c><00:02:04.719><c> mucus</c><00:02:05.200><c> than</c>

00:02:05.350 --> 00:02:05.360 align:start position:0%
starts to produce way more mucus than
 

00:02:05.360 --> 00:02:06.389 align:start position:0%
starts to produce way more mucus than
normal<00:02:05.920><c> and</c><00:02:06.079><c> it</c>

00:02:06.389 --> 00:02:06.399 align:start position:0%
normal and it
 

00:02:06.399 --> 00:02:08.070 align:start position:0%
normal and it
starts<00:02:06.719><c> to</c><00:02:06.880><c> cough</c><00:02:07.200><c> when</c><00:02:07.360><c> maybe</c><00:02:07.680><c> it's</c><00:02:07.840><c> not</c>

00:02:08.070 --> 00:02:08.080 align:start position:0%
starts to cough when maybe it's not
 

00:02:08.080 --> 00:02:09.430 align:start position:0%

00:02:09.430 --> 00:02:09.440 align:start position:0%
supposed to
 

00:02:09.440 --> 00:02:11.350 align:start position:0%
supposed to
and<00:02:09.599><c> so</c><00:02:09.759><c> we</c><00:02:09.920><c> can</c><00:02:10.080><c> kind</c><00:02:10.239><c> of</c><00:02:10.399><c> think</c><00:02:10.640><c> about</c><00:02:10.959><c> that</c>

00:02:11.350 --> 00:02:11.360 align:start position:0%
and so we can kind of think about that
 

00:02:11.360 --> 00:02:13.750 align:start position:0%
and so we can kind of think about that
as<00:02:11.680><c> an</c><00:02:11.920><c> illness</c><00:02:12.400><c> it's</c><00:02:12.560><c> the</c><00:02:12.720><c> body</c><00:02:13.120><c> not</c><00:02:13.360><c> working</c>

00:02:13.750 --> 00:02:13.760 align:start position:0%
as an illness it's the body not working

the way it's supposed to
 

00:02:15.200 --> 00:02:17.350 align:start position:0%
the way it's supposed to
if<00:02:15.360><c> we</c><00:02:15.520><c> think</c><00:02:15.680><c> about</c><00:02:15.920><c> blood</c><00:02:16.319><c> pressure</c><00:02:17.040><c> so</c><00:02:17.200><c> our</c>

00:02:17.350 --> 00:02:17.360 align:start position:0%
if we think about blood pressure so our

like<00:02:22.400><c> hypertension</c>

00:02:23.750 --> 00:02:23.760 align:start position:0%
like hypertension

our<00:02:23.920><c> blood</c><00:02:24.239><c> pressure</c><00:02:24.879><c> rises</c><00:02:25.920><c> above</c><00:02:26.319><c> what</c><00:02:26.480><c> it's</c>

00:02:26.710 --> 00:02:26.720 align:start position:0%
our blood pressure rises above what it's
 

00:02:26.720 --> 00:02:27.830 align:start position:0%
our blood pressure rises above what it's

so<00:02:28.000><c> that</c><00:02:28.319><c> too</c><00:02:28.560><c> is</c><00:02:28.640><c> a</c><00:02:28.800><c> malfunction</c><00:02:30.560><c> and</c>

00:02:30.790 --> 00:02:30.800 align:start position:0%
so that too is a malfunction and
 

00:02:30.800 --> 00:02:31.589 align:start position:0%
so that too is a malfunction and
sometimes

00:02:31.589 --> 00:02:31.599 align:start position:0%
sometimes
 

00:02:31.599 --> 00:02:33.589 align:start position:0%
sometimes
our<00:02:31.760><c> brain</c><00:02:32.080><c> malfunctions</c><00:02:32.879><c> and</c><00:02:33.040><c> we</c><00:02:33.280><c> end</c><00:02:33.440><c> up</c>

00:02:33.589 --> 00:02:33.599 align:start position:0%
our brain malfunctions and we end up
 

00:02:33.599 --> 00:02:35.270 align:start position:0%
our brain malfunctions and we end up
with<00:02:33.840><c> clinical</c><00:02:34.400><c> depression</c>

00:02:35.270 --> 00:02:35.280 align:start position:0%

00:02:35.280 --> 00:02:37.910 align:start position:0%
with clinical depression
and<00:02:35.440><c> so</c><00:02:35.599><c> what</c><00:02:35.760><c> that</c><00:02:36.000><c> means</c><00:02:36.319><c> is</c><00:02:36.480><c> that</c><00:02:36.720><c> like</c><00:02:37.760><c> what</c>

00:02:37.910 --> 00:02:37.920 align:start position:0%
and so what that means is that like what
 

00:02:37.920 --> 00:02:39.270 align:start position:0%
and so what that means is that like what
that<00:02:38.080><c> really</c><00:02:38.319><c> means</c><00:02:38.560><c> is</c><00:02:38.720><c> that</c><00:02:38.879><c> your</c>

00:02:39.270 --> 00:02:39.280 align:start position:0%
that really means is that your
 

00:02:39.280 --> 00:02:42.390 align:start position:0%
that really means is that your

brain is malfunctioning compared to what
 

00:02:42.400 --> 00:02:44.309 align:start position:0%

00:08:46.230 --> 00:08:46.240 align:start position:0%
this is our compass like isn't that a

this is our compass like isn't that a

00:08:49.030 --> 00:08:49.040 align:start position:0%
and this is where i think we get into

00:08:51.110 --> 00:08:51.120 align:start position:0%
some really tricky stuff which is that
 

00:08:51.120 --> 00:08:53.509 align:start position:0%
some really tricky stuff which is that
these<00:08:51.519><c> signals</c><00:08:52.000><c> from</c><00:08:52.240><c> our</c><00:08:52.480><c> brain</c><00:08:53.040><c> used</c><00:08:53.360><c> to</c>

00:08:53.509 --> 00:08:53.519 align:start position:0%
these signals from our brain used to

00:08:55.990 --> 00:08:56.000 align:start position:0%
have easy solutions
 

00:08:56.000 --> 00:08:57.590 align:start position:0%
have easy solutions
and<00:08:56.160><c> i</c><00:08:56.240><c> think</c><00:08:56.399><c> the</c><00:08:56.560><c> reason</c><00:08:56.880><c> that</c><00:08:57.040><c> we</c><00:08:57.200><c> suffer</c>

00:08:57.590 --> 00:08:57.600 align:start position:0%
and i think the reason that we suffer
 

00:08:57.600 --> 00:08:59.350 align:start position:0%
and i think the reason that we suffer
now<00:08:58.000><c> is</c><00:08:58.160><c> because</c><00:08:58.399><c> they</c><00:08:58.560><c> don't</c><00:08:58.720><c> really</c><00:08:59.040><c> have</c>

00:08:59.350 --> 00:08:59.360 align:start position:0%
now is because they don't really have
 

00:08:59.360 --> 00:09:01.190 align:start position:0%
now is because they don't really have
